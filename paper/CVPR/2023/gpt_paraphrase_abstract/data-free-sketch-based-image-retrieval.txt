This study focuses on the emerging field of data-free learning (DFL), which aims to address privacy and anonymity concerns in deep learning models. The researchers propose a data-free approach called Data-Free (DF)-SBIR for Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR) tasks, where acquiring paired photos and sketches is difficult. Unlike existing DFL problems, DF-SBIR leverages pre-trained single-modality classification models to learn a cross-modal metric space for retrieval without any training data. The practicality of this approach is justified by the availability of pre-trained classification models and the challenges in obtaining paired photo-sketch datasets for SBIR. The researchers present a methodology for DF-SBIR that utilizes knowledge from independently trained classification models for photos and sketches. The proposed model is evaluated on various benchmarks and outperforms state-of-the-art DFL methods by a significant margin. It also achieves competitive mean average precisions (mAPs) compared to data-dependent approaches, despite not requiring any training data. The implementation of the model is available at https://github.com/abhrac/data-free-sbir.
