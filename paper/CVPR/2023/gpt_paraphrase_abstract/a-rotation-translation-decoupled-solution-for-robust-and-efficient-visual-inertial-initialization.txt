We propose a new method for initializing visual-inertial odometry (VIO) that improves efficiency and robustness by separating rotation and translation estimation. Current VIO initialization methods either have poor stability in visual structure-from-motion or ignore gyroscope bias, leading to limited accuracy. Additionally, these methods are computationally expensive due to simultaneous 3D point cloud reconstruction. In contrast, our method combines inertial and visual measurements to initialize both rotation and translation. We first design a solution for estimating gyroscope bias that tightly couples gyroscope and camera observations. Then, we solve for initial velocity and gravity vector using linear translation constraints without reconstructing 3D point clouds. Our extensive experiments show that our method is 8-72 times faster than state-of-the-art methods and achieves higher robustness and accuracy.
