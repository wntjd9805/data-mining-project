This study focuses on the problem of single domain generalization, where a model is trained on one domain and then applied to multiple unseen domains. Existing methods attempt to expand the distribution of the training domain to cover the target domains, but they do not address the domain shift between the source and target domains. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a new learning paradigm called simulate-analyze-reduce. This paradigm involves simulating the domain shift by creating an auxiliary domain as the target domain, analyzing the causes of domain shift, and reducing the domain shift for model adaptation.To implement this paradigm, the authors propose a meta-causal learning method to acquire meta-knowledge during training. This meta-knowledge helps infer the causes of domain shift between the auxiliary and source domains. During testing, this inferred causality is used to analyze the shift between the target and source domains. The authors achieve this by performing various transformations on the source data to generate the auxiliary domain, employing counterfactual inference to identify the causal factors of the shift between the auxiliary and source domains, and incorporating this inferred causality into factor-aware domain alignments.The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks. The results show that the method successfully addresses the problem of single domain generalization by effectively analyzing and reducing the domain shift between source and target domains.
