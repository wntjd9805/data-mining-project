TruFor is a forensic framework that can detect various image manipulation techniques, including cheapfakes and deepfakes. It utilizes a fusion architecture that combines RGB images and a learned noise-sensitive fingerprint to extract high-level and low-level traces. The fingerprint captures camera-related artifacts through self-supervised training on real data. TruFor detects forgeries by identifying deviations from the expected regular pattern in pristine images. It can robustly detect local manipulations and provides a reliability map to indicate areas where localization predictions may be less accurate. The framework outperforms existing methods in detecting and localizing both cheapfakes and deepfakes. The code for TruFor is publicly available.
