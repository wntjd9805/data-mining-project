This study addresses the challenge of classifying Whole Slide Images (WSIs), which are large in size and lack pixel-level annotations. These WSIs also have imbalanced categories, making classification difficult. To tackle this, the authors propose a data augmentation method called RankMix. RankMix mixes ranked features from a pair of WSIs and introduces pseudo labeling and ranking concepts to identify key regions for classification. A two-stage training approach is also suggested to enhance training and model performance. This research is unique as it explores weakly supervised learning through data augmentation to address the WSI classification problem, which is characterized by limited training data and imbalanced categories.
