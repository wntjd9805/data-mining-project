Non-blind deblurring methods perform well when the blur kernel is accurately known. However, in practical scenarios, there is always uncertainty in the blur kernel, which necessitates the use of semi-blind deblurring techniques. These techniques rely on a prior assumption about the error in the blur kernel. Designing a suitable prior for the kernel error is a challenging task. Hand-crafted priors, which incorporate domain knowledge, are effective but struggle with complex kernel errors. On the other hand, data-driven priors heavily rely on training data, making them vulnerable to out-of-distribution blurs and images. To address this challenge, we propose a dataset-free deep residual prior for the kernel-induced error. This prior is expressed using an untrained deep neural network that can adapt to different blurs and images in real scenarios. By combining the strengths of deep priors and hand-crafted priors, we introduce an unsupervised semi-blind deblurring model that can recover clear images from blurry images with inaccurate blur kernels. We also develop an efficient alternating minimization algorithm to solve the proposed model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms model-driven and data-driven methods in terms of image quality and robustness to different types of kernel errors.
