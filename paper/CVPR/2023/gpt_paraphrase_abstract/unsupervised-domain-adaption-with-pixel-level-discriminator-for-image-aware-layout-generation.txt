This paper discusses the importance of layout in graphic design and poster generation. It highlights the growing interest in using deep learning models to generate layouts and focuses specifically on using a GAN-based model conditioned on image contents to generate advertising poster layouts. However, the existing dataset for this task consists of paired images and layouts that were collected through inpainting and annotating posters, resulting in a domain gap between the inpainted posters (source domain data) and the clean product images (target domain data). To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel GAN called PDA-GAN, which incorporates unsupervised domain adaptation techniques and features a pixel-level discriminator (PD). The PD is connected to the shallow level feature map and computes the GAN loss for each input-image pixel. The performance of PDA-GAN is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art results and generates high-quality image-aware graphic layouts for advertising posters.
