This paper introduces a novel approach called Pose as Compositional Tokens (PCT) to address the issue of unrealistic pose estimation in human pose representation. Current methods lack dependency modeling between body joints, leading to inaccurate pose estimates. PCT represents a pose using discrete tokens that capture the interdependent joints within sub-structures. This compositional design allows for accurate pose reconstruction at a low computational cost. The authors propose treating pose estimation as a classification task, where a classifier is trained to predict the categories of the tokens from an image. A pre-trained decoder network is then used to recover the pose from the tokens without additional post-processing. The results demonstrate that PCT achieves comparable or superior pose estimation performance compared to existing methods in most scenarios, and it also performs well in the presence of occlusion, which is common in real-world applications. The code and models for PCT are publicly available at https://github.com/Gengzigang/PCT.
