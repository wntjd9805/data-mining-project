This study proposes a novel approach for reconstructing the complete geometry and texture of a human from an image where only a partial body is visible, such as a torso. The main challenge lies in the occlusion, as existing methods for single-view human reconstruction are not designed to handle invisible parts, resulting in missing 3D data. To overcome this challenge, the authors introduce a new framework for human reconstruction. In the coarse reconstruction phase, explicit volumetric features are learned using 3D convolutional neural networks, conditioned by a 3D body model and style features from the visible parts. In the fine reconstruction phase, an implicit network combines the learned 3D features with high-quality surface normals obtained from multiple views to generate detailed local features like wrinkles. Finally, a progressive texture inpainting technique is employed to reconstruct the complete appearance of the person in a view-consistent manner, which requires the reconstruction of a complete geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can reconstruct high-quality 3D humans, even in the presence of occlusion.
