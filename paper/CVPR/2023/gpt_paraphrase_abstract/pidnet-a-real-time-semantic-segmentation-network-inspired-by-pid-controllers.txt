The efficiency and effectiveness of two-branch network architecture in real-time semantic segmentation tasks have been established. However, the direct fusion of high-resolution details and low-frequency context presents a challenge as detailed features can be easily overwhelmed by surrounding contextual information, limiting the segmentation accuracy improvement of existing two-branch models. This paper draws a connection between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers, highlighting that a two-branch network is akin to a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, which suffers from similar overshoot issues. To address this problem, a novel three-branch network architecture, PIDNet, is proposed. PIDNet consists of three branches dedicated to parsing detailed, context, and boundary information, respectively. It employs boundary attention to guide the fusion of detailed and context branches. The family of PIDNets achieves the best balance between inference speed and accuracy, surpassing all existing models with similar inference speed on the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets. In particular, PIDNet-S achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) of 78.6% at an inference speed of 93.2 frames per second (FPS) on Cityscapes and 80.1% mIOU at a speed of 153.7 FPS on CamVid.
