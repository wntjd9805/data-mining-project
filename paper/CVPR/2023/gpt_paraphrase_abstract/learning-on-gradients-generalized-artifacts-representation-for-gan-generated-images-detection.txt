Recently, there has been a significant advancement in image generation technology called GAN, which can generate realistic fake images. However, current image detectors struggle with detecting these fake images in unseen domains. To address this issue, we propose a new detection framework called Learning on Gradients (LGrad) that aims to develop a generalized representation of artifacts produced by generation models. In LGrad, we use a pretrained CNN model to convert images into gradients, which are then used to identify the authenticity of the images. This approach transforms the data-dependent problem into a transformation-model-dependent problem. We believe this is the first study to utilize gradients as representations of artifacts in GAN-generated images. Extensive experiments show that gradients are effective and robust as generalized artifact representations, and our detector achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with an impressive gain of 11.4%. The code for LGrad is available at https://github.com/chuangchuangtan/LGrad.
