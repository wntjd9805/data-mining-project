The origin of adversarial examples remains unexplained in research fields, leading to debates among different perspectives despite extensive investigations. This paper introduces a novel approach called adversarial instrumental variable (IV) regression to explore the unexpected vulnerability in adversarially trained networks from a causal standpoint. By using this method, we can estimate the causal relationship of adversarial prediction in an unbiased environment that is separate from unknown confounding factors. Our goal is to unravel the inherent causal characteristics of adversarial examples by employing a zero-sum optimization game between a causal feature estimator (hypothesis model) and worst-case counterfactuals (test function) that disrupt to identify causal features. Through thorough analysis, we demonstrate that the estimated causal features are closely linked to accurate predictions for adversarial robustness, while the counterfactuals exhibit extreme features that significantly deviate from correct predictions. Additionally, we present a technique called CAusal FEatures (CAFE) to effectively incorporate causal features into defense networks in order to enhance adversarial robustness.
