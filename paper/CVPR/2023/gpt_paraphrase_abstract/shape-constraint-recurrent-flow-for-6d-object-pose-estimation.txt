Recently, many methods for estimating the pose of 6D objects have utilized 2D optical flow to improve their results. However, these general optical flow methods do not take into account the 3D shape of the target object during matching, which limits their effectiveness. In this study, we propose a shape-constraint recurrent matching framework for 6D object pose estimation. Our approach involves calculating a pose-induced flow by comparing the 2D reprojected images of the initial pose and the currently estimated pose, which implicitly incorporates the target object's 3D shape. We then use this pose-induced flow to create a correlation map for subsequent matching iterations, significantly reducing the matching space and simplifying the learning process. Additionally, we employ networks to learn the object pose based on the current estimated flow, enabling the computation of the pose-induced flow for the next iteration and creating an end-to-end system for object pose estimation. Finally, we optimize the optical flow and object pose concurrently in a recurrent manner. We evaluate our method using three challenging 6D object pose datasets and demonstrate that it surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
