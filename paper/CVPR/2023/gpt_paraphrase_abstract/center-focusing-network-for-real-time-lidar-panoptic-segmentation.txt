A new approach called the center focusing network (CFNet) is introduced to improve the accuracy and efficiency of LiDAR panoptic segmentation in autonomous vehicles. The proposed center focusing feature encoding (CFFE) helps understand the relationship between LiDAR points and virtual instance centers, enhancing the understanding of surrounding objects and scenes. Additionally, a fast center deduplication module (CDM) is introduced to select only one center for each instance, leveraging redundantly detected centers. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFNet outperforms existing methods by a significant margin and is 1.6 times faster than the most efficient method.
