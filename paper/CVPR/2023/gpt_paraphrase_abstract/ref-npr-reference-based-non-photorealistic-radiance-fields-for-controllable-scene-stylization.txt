The current methods for stylizing 3D scenes lack meaningful semantic correspondences and use arbitrary style references to transfer textures and colors. To address this limitation, we propose a method called Reference-Based Non-Photorealistic Radiance Fields (Ref-NPR). This method stylizes a 3D scene by using radiance fields and a single stylized 2D view as a reference. We introduce a ray registration process based on the stylized reference view to obtain pseudo-ray supervision in novel views. Additionally, we utilize semantic correspondences in content images to fill occluded regions with styles that are perceptually similar. This results in the creation of non-photorealistic and continuous novel view sequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that Ref-NPR performs better than existing scene and video stylization methods in terms of visual quality and semantic correspondence. The code and data for Ref-NPR can be found on the project page at https://ref-npr.github.io.
