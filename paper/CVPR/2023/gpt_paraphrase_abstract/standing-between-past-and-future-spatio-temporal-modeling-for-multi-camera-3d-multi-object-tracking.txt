This study introduces a comprehensive framework called PF-Track for multi-camera 3D multi-object tracking (MOT). PF-Track focuses on maintaining spatio-temporal continuity and utilizes both past and future reasoning to track objects. The framework employs a "tracking by attention" approach and represents tracked instances consistently over time using object queries. The "Past Reasoning" module refines the tracks and enhances object features by cross-attending to queries from previous frames and other objects. The "Future Reasoning" module utilizes historical information to predict robust future trajectories. In scenarios with long-term occlusions, the method maintains object positions and enables re-association by incorporating motion predictions. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate significant improvements in AMOTA and a remarkable reduction in ID-Switches compared to previous methods. The code and models for PF-Track are publicly available at https://github.com/TRI-ML/PF-Track.
