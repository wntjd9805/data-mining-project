This paper introduces a new style transfer framework called QuantArt that aims to achieve high visual-fidelity in generated artworks. Traditional style transfer algorithms minimize a hybrid loss function to align both content and style, but they do not guarantee that the generated artworks will be indistinguishable from real ones. QuantArt addresses this limitation by using vector quantization to push the latent representation of the generated artwork towards the centroids of the real artwork distribution. By combining quantized and continuous latent representations, QuantArt allows for flexible control over the generated artworks in terms of content preservation, style similarity, and visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that the QuantArt framework achieves significantly higher visual fidelity compared to existing style transfer methods across various settings.
