NeRF is a technique that reconstructs a neural representation of a scene for the purpose of generating new views. However, it does not consider the interaction of shadow rays between the light source and the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach that supervises the shadow rays, optimizing both the samples along the ray and the ray's location. This allows us to successfully reconstruct a neural signed distance function (SDF) of the scene using single-view images under different lighting conditions. We train a neural network to reconstruct the complete scene, taking into account binary shadows from a single view. Additionally, by considering the correlation between image colors and shadow rays, our method can effectively handle RGB inputs as well. We compared our technique with previous methods on challenging tasks of shape reconstruction from single-view binary shadow or RGB images and observed significant improvements. The code and data for our approach are available at https://github.com/gerwang/ShadowNeuS.
