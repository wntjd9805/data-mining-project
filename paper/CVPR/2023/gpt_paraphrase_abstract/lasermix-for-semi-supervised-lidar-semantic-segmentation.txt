This study explores the use of semi-supervised learning (SSL) in LiDAR semantic segmentation as a cost-effective alternative to the expensive process of densely annotating LiDAR point clouds. The main idea is to leverage the spatial information present in the LiDAR point clouds to better utilize unlabeled data. The proposed approach, called LaserMix, involves mixing laser beams from different LiDAR scans and encouraging the model to make consistent and confident predictions before and after mixing. The framework has three key properties: it is generic and can be applied to different LiDAR representations, it is statistically grounded with a theoretical explanation of its applicability, and it is effective, as demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on popular LiDAR segmentation datasets (nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and ScribbleKITTI). The results show that LaserMix achieves competitive performance compared to fully-supervised methods with significantly fewer labeled samples (2× to 5× fewer) and improves the performance of the supervised-only baseline by 10.8%. The authors hope that this concise and high-performing framework will contribute to future research in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. The code for the framework is publicly available.
