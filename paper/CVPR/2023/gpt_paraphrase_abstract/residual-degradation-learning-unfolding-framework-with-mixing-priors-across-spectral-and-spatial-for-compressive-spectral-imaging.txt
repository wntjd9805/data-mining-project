This study introduces a method called Residual Degradation Learning Unfolding Framework (RDLUF) in order to address the challenges of recovering reliable and accurate 3D spectral information from 2D measurements in coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) systems. The existing deep unfolding methods have shown promising results by solving data and prior subproblems alternately. However, these methods face issues due to the inadequacy of the sensing matrix in capturing real degradation processes caused by device errors, and the lack of a suitable model to effectively exploit both spatial and spectral priors. To overcome these limitations, the proposed RDLUF method bridges the gap between the sensing matrix and the degradation process, improving the accuracy of the data subproblem. Additionally, a MixS2 Transformer is designed to incorporate both spatial and spectral priors, enhancing the representation capability. By combining the MixS2 Transformer with the RDLUF framework, an end-to-end trainable neural network called RDLUF-MixS2 is created. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches. The code for implementing RDLUF-MixS2 is available at the provided GitHub link.
