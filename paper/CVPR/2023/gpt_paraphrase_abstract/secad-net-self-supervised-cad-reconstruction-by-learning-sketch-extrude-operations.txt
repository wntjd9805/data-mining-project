SECAD-Net is a novel neural network designed to address the challenging task of reverse engineering CAD models from raw geometry. Unlike previous methods that rely on labels or produce non-editable CAD shapes, SECAD-Net aims to reconstruct compact and easily editable CAD models in a self-supervised manner. The network learns to generate 2D sketches and 3D extrusion parameters from raw shapes, allowing for the creation of extrusion cylinders by extruding each sketch from a 2D plane into a 3D body. These cylinders can then be combined using Boolean operations to closely approximate the target geometry. To represent sketches, the use of implicit fields is advocated, enabling CAD variations through interpolation of latent codes in the sketch latent space. Extensive experiments on ABC and Fusion 360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SECAD-Net, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives, including supervised CAD reconstruction methods. The approach is also applied to CAD editing and single-view CAD reconstruction. The code for SECAD-Net will be made available at https://github.com/BunnySoCrazy/SECAD-Net.
