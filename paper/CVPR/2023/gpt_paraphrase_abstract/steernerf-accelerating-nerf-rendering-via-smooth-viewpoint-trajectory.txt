Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in synthesizing new views, but they are slow in the rendering process. Various acceleration methods have been proposed, but they come with high memory consumption. To address this efficiency-memory trade-off, we propose a new approach for accelerating NeRF rendering. We exploit the fact that viewpoint changes are usually smooth and continuous during interactive viewpoint control. This allows us to utilize information from previous viewpoints to reduce the number of rendered pixels and sampled points along the ray. Our pipeline involves rendering a low-resolution feature map using volume rendering and then applying a lightweight 2D neural renderer to generate the final image at the desired resolution. By leveraging the features of preceding and current frames, our method achieves competitive rendering quality while significantly reducing rendering time and memory usage. We demonstrate that our approach enables real-time rendering at 30 frames per second with a low memory footprint for 1080P image resolution.
