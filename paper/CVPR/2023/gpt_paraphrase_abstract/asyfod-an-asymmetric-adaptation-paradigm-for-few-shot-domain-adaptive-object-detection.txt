This study focuses on few-shot domain adaptive object detection (FSDAOD), which involves training a model with a limited number of labeled target images and a sufficient number of labeled source images. However, FSDAOD faces challenges due to a severe data imbalance between the source and target domains, which can lead to over-adaptation in feature alignment. To tackle this problem, the authors propose an asymmetric adaptation paradigm called AsyFOD. AsyFOD leverages target distribution estimation to identify source instances that are similar to the target, thereby augmenting the limited target instances. Additionally, asynchronous alignment is performed between target-dissimilar source instances and augmented target instances to mitigate over-adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AsyFOD over existing methods on four FSDAOD benchmarks with varying environmental conditions, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision (mAP). The code for AsyFOD is publicly available at https://github.com/Hlings/AsyFOD.
