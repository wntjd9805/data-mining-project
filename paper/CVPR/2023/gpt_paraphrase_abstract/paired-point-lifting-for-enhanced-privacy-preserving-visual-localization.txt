Visual localization is a crucial aspect of various vision and robotics systems, involving the determination of camera pose based on input images and a known scene. One common method for localization is using a sparse 3D point cloud generated through structure-from-motion (SfM). However, recent research has highlighted privacy concerns as these sparse 3D representations can reveal detailed information about the scene's appearance. To address this issue, a previous approach involved transforming 3D points into randomly oriented 3D lines, thereby concealing the scene geometry. Nevertheless, recent work has exposed a statistical vulnerability in this random line cloud, making it susceptible to attacks. In this study, we propose an alternative approach called Paired-Point Lifting (PPL) for constructing 3D line clouds. Instead of assigning a single randomly oriented line to each 3D point, PPL pairs up the points and connects them to form 3D lines. This seemingly simple strategy offers three advantages: introducing ambiguity in feature selection, increasing sparsity in the line cloud, and providing a non-trivial distribution of 3D lines. These benefits contribute to improved protection against privacy attacks. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PPL in concealing scene details without compromising localization accuracy, thereby unlocking the full potential of 3D line clouds.
