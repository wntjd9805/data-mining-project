Learning the prior knowledge of 3D human pose is crucial for the advancement of human-centered AI. In this study, we introduce GFPose, a flexible framework designed to model plausible 3D human poses for various applications. The key component of GFPose is a time-dependent score network that calculates the gradient on each body joint and progressively removes noise from the perturbed 3D human pose in order to match a specified task. Throughout the denoising process, GFPose incorporates pose priors implicitly in the gradients, effectively combining discriminative and generative tasks within a unified framework. Despite its simplicity, GFPose displays promising potential in several downstream tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) as a multi-hypothesis pose estimator, GFPose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 20% on the Human3.6M dataset; 2) as a single-hypothesis pose estimator, GFPose achieves comparable results to deterministic state-of-the-art methods, even with a basic backbone model; 3) GFPose is capable of producing diverse and realistic samples in pose denoising, completion, and generation tasks.
