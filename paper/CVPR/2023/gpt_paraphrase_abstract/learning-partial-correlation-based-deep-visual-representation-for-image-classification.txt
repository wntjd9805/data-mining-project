The effectiveness of visual representation based on the covariance matrix for image classification has been demonstrated. However, when there is another channel that correlates with both channels of interest, the pairwise correlation becomes misleading due to the "confounding" effect. To address this issue, we propose estimating the "partial correlation" instead, which removes the confounding effect. Estimating partial correlation reliably requires solving a symmetric positive definite matrix optimization problem known as sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE). Incorporating this process into convolutional neural networks (CNNs) remains an open issue. In this study, we introduce SICE as a novel structured layer of CNN and develop an iterative method to solve the matrix optimization during forward and backward propagation steps, ensuring end-to-end trainability. Our approach overcomes the small sample problem often encountered in covariance matrix estimation in CNNs, resulting in a deep visual representation based on partial correlation. The computational efficiency of our model allows effective training using GPUs and handles a large number of channels in advanced CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and superior classification performance of our deep visual representation compared to covariance matrix-based approaches.
