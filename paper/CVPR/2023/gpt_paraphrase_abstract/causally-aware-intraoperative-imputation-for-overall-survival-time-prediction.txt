This paper focuses on the importance of causal reasoning in addition to learning representations from visual patterns in the field of computer vision. The authors present a case study on predicting Overall Survival (OS) time in primary liver cancers, which is a challenging task due to the lack of obvious image patterns that reflect OS. To address this, they propose a causal inference system that utilizes intraoperative attributes and their correlations as intermediate supervision to bridge the gap between images and OS prediction. They introduce a causal graph and train the images to estimate the intraoperative attributes for final OS prediction. They also propose a novel Causally-aware Intraoperative Imputation Model (CAWIM) that sequentially predicts each attribute based on its parent nodes in the estimated causal graph. To determine the causal directions, they propose a splitting-voting mechanism that votes for the direction for each pair of adjacent nodes based on multiple predictions obtained via causal discovery. The authors demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of their method through promising results on a liver cancer dataset with long-term observations of 361 patients.
