We present a method for generating shadows in differentiable rendering of triangle meshes that is both efficient and accurate. Our key insight is that by combining pre-filtered shadow mapping, a technique that approximates shadows by rendering from the perspective of a light source, with existing differentiable rasterizers, we can obtain differentiable visibility information. We show through various inverse graphics problems that our differentiable shadow maps achieve similar accuracy as differentiable light transport simulation but are orders of magnitude faster. In contrast, differentiable rasterization without shadows frequently fails to converge.
