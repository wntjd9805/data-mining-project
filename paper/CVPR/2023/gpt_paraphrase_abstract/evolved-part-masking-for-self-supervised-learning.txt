This study introduces a new approach to masked image modeling in self-supervised learning. Unlike existing methods that use fixed mask patterns, this proposed method utilizes an adaptive part partition module to generate evolved mask patterns. The module constructs a part graph based on the vision model being trained and partitions the parts using graph cut. The accuracy of the partitioned parts is comparable to the pre-trained model's capability, resulting in evolved mask patterns at different training stages. The initial training stage focuses on learning low-level visual cues with simple patterns, while later stages eliminate accurate object parts to reinforce the learning of object semantics and contexts. This method does not require additional pre-trained models or annotations and effectively ensures training efficiency by evolving the training difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. For instance, it achieves a 0.69% higher accuracy than the recent MAE on imageNet-1K classification and a 1.61% improvement on ADE20K segmentation with the same training epochs.
