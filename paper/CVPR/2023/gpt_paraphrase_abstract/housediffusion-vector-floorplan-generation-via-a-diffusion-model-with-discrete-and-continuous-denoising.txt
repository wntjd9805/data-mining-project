This paper introduces a new method for generating vector floorplans using a diffusion model. The model focuses on denoising the 2D coordinates of room and door corners by utilizing two inference objectives. The first objective involves a single-step noise as a continuous quantity to accurately reverse the continuous forward process. The second objective employs the final 2D coordinate as a discrete quantity to establish geometric relationships such as parallelism, orthogonality, and corner-sharing. The task at hand is graph-conditioned floorplan generation, a common workflow in floorplan design. The floorplans are represented as 1D polygonal loops, with each loop corresponding to a room or a door. The diffusion model utilizes a Transformer architecture as its core, which controls the attention masks based on the input graph constraint. This allows the model to generate vector-graphics floorplans through a process of discrete and continuous denoising. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the RPLAN dataset and has shown significant improvements in all metrics compared to the state-of-the-art methods. It is capable of generating non-Manhattan structures and provides control over the exact number of corners per room.
