In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimization framework called Magic3D to address the limitations of the DreamFusion method in text-to-3D synthesis. DreamFusion has shown promising results but suffers from slow optimization of NeRF and low-resolution image space supervision, resulting in low-quality 3D models and long processing times. To overcome these limitations, our framework first uses a low-resolution diffusion prior to obtain a coarse model, which is accelerated with a sparse 3D hash grid structure. This coarse representation serves as the initialization for further optimization of a textured 3D mesh model. We achieve this optimization using an efficient differentiable renderer that interacts with a high-resolution latent diffusion model. Compared to DreamFusion, our method, Magic3D, can create high-quality 3D mesh models in 40 minutes, which is 2 times faster than DreamFusion's reported average time of 1.5 hours. Additionally, our approach achieves higher resolution. User studies show that 61.7% of raters prefer our approach over DreamFusion. Furthermore, our method provides users with new ways to control 3D synthesis through image-conditioned generation capabilities. This opens up new possibilities for various creative applications.
