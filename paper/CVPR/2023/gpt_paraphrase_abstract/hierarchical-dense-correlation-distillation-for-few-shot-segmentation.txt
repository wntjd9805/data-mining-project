This study focuses on few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS), which involves segmenting unseen classes with limited annotations. Previous methods using semantic feature and prototype representation suffer from coarse segmentation and overfitting. To address this, we propose the Hierarchically Decoupled Matching Network (HDMNet) that utilizes a transformer architecture to mine pixel-level support correlation. The self-attention modules help establish hierarchical dense features for cascade matching between query and support features. We also introduce a matching module to reduce overfitting and use correlation distillation to enhance fine-grained segmentation. Our method achieves good results in experiments, with a 50.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the COCO-20i dataset in the one-shot setting and 56.0% in the five-shot segmentation. The code is available on the project website.
