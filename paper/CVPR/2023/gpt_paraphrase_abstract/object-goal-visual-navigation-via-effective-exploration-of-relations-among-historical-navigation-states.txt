This study addresses the issue of navigation inefficiency or failure caused by high relevance among navigation states in object-goal visual navigation. Previous research has focused on learning visual representations for navigation but has overlooked the impact of navigation states on effectiveness and efficiency. To address this, the authors propose the History-inspired Navigation Policy Learning (HiNL) framework, which effectively estimates navigation states by exploring relationships among historical navigation states. The framework includes a History-aware State Estimation (HaSE) module to mitigate the effects of dominant historical states on current state estimation and encourage the agent to be alert to current observation changes. Additionally, a History-based State Regularization (HbSR) method is designed to explicitly suppress correlations among navigation states during training. Experimental results on the AI2-THOR platform show that HiNL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Success Rate and SPL in unseen testing environments.
