We have developed a neural technique that allows for the learning of selecting a specific area around a point on a mesh surface. This technique is useful for tasks such as decaling, texturing, and painting on surfaces. Our approach involves incorporating segmentation probabilities into a parameterization method, which is implemented as a differentiable parameterization layer within a neural network framework. We train a segmentation network to identify 3D regions that can be transformed into 2D representations, and penalize the resulting distortion. This results in distortion-aware segmentations. After training, users can utilize our system to interactively select a point on the mesh and obtain a large region around it that exhibits low distortion in the parameterization. Our code and project are publicly available.
