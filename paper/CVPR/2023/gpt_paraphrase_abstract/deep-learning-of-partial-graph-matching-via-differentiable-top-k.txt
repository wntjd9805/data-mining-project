Graph matching (GM) is a challenging task that involves finding matching nodes between graphs, with the aim of maximizing the similarity between the matched elements. This problem becomes even more difficult when outlier nodes are present in both graphs, which is common in real-world vision problems. Existing affinity-maximization-based methods often struggle to handle outliers and rely on manual thresholding to remove them. This limitation also affects neural GM solvers, despite their superior performance in ideal settings without outliers. To address this issue, we propose a new approach to tackle the partial GM problem by formulating it as a top-k selection task, where k represents the number of inliers. We introduce a differentiable top-k module that enables efficient gradient descent over the optimal-transport layer. This module can be easily integrated into state-of-the-art deep GM pipelines, such as the quadratic matching network NGMv2 and the linear matching network GCAN. Additionally, we develop attention-fused aggregation layers to estimate the value of k automatically, enabling robust matching even in the presence of outliers in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark called IMC-PT-SparseGM, which is derived from the IMC-PT stereo-matching dataset. This benchmark includes graphs of varying scales and partial matching instances from real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform other partial matching approaches on popular benchmarks.
