Neural radiance-density field methods have gained popularity in novel-view rendering. Hash-based positional encoding has improved training and inference speed with visually pleasing results. However, accurately capturing surface geometry remains a challenge for density-based methods. Hybrid approaches address this issue by optimizing density based on an underlying signed distance function (SDF). However, current SDF methods lack fine geometric details due to excessive smoothness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hash-based implicit surface representation that combines the strengths of both approaches. Our method introduces improvements by replacing voxel hash encoding with a permutohedral lattice, enabling faster optimization, especially in higher dimensions. Additionally, we propose a crucial regularization scheme for recovering high-frequency geometric detail. Through evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the ability to recover fine details such as pores and wrinkles using only RGB images for supervision. Moreover, our method achieves real-time rendering of novel views at 30 frames per second on an RTX 3090 GPU. The code for our approach is publicly available at https://radualexandru.github.io/permuto_sdf.
