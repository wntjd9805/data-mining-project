There has been recent interest in weakly supervised instance segmentation using only bounding box annotations. However, most current approaches focus on low-level image features and do not effectively utilize high-level semantic information. This becomes problematic when foreground objects have similar appearances to the background or other nearby objects. To address this, we propose a new box-supervised instance segmentation method called Semantic-aware Instance Mask (SIM) generation. Instead of relying on local pairwise affinities, we create category-wise feature centroids as prototypes to identify foreground objects and assign them semantic-level pseudo labels. Since these prototypes cannot differentiate between different instances of the same semantics, we introduce a self-correction mechanism to rectify falsely activated regions and improve correct ones. Additionally, we adapt the Copy-Paste operation to handle occlusions between objects and augment challenging training data for weakly supervised instance segmentation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the SIM approach compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The source code for our approach is available at https://github.com/lslrh/SIM.
