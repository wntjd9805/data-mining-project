The ProPhoto color space is commonly used in cameras and image-editing software, capturing 90% of visible colors. However, when these images are shared, they are converted and limited to the smaller sRGB color space, which represents only 30% of visible colors. Restoring the lost color information is difficult due to this conversion process. To address this, we propose a method called GamutMLP that uses a lightweight MLP model to predict the clipped values during the gamut reduction step. Our GamutMLP model is optimized in just 2 seconds and requires only 23 KB of storage, allowing it to be saved as metadata in the sRGB image. We also introduce a new color gamut dataset for training and testing, consisting of 2200 wide-gamut and small-gamut images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GamutMLP for color recovery and compare it with other approaches, including pre-trained DNN-based gamut expansion networks and implicit neural representation methods.
