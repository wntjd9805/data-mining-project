Camera pose estimation is a crucial step in reconstructing 3D models using a collection of images. However, existing methods struggle when there are only a few images available, as they rely on accurately identifying and matching visual features between image pairs. Collecting a large number of images can be time-consuming or impractical. In this study, we introduce SparsePose, a method for accurately estimating camera poses using a sparse set of wide-baseline images (fewer than 10). Our approach involves training on a vast dataset of objects (Co3D: CommonObjects in 3D) to learn how to regress initial camera poses and iteratively refine them. SparsePose outperforms traditional and learning-based methods in accurately determining camera rotations and translations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by successfully reconstructing high-fidelity 3D models using only 5-9 images of an object.
