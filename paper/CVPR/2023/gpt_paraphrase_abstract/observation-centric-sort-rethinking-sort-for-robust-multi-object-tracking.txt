The Kalman filter is commonly used for multi-object tracking, but it assumes linear object motion which can lead to inaccuracies over prolonged periods of occlusion. Additionally, relying solely on prior state estimations during occlusion can accumulate errors. In this study, we introduce a method called Observation-Centric SORT (OC-SORT) that utilizes object observations to compute a virtual trajectory during occlusion, effectively correcting the accumulated errors. This approach improves robustness during occlusion and non-linear motion while maintaining simplicity, online capability, and real-time performance. OC-SORT achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets and runs efficiently on a single CPU. The code and models for OC-SORT are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT.
