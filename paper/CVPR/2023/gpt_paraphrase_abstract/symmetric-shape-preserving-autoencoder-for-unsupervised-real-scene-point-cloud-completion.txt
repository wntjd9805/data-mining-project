Unsupervised completion of object shapes in real scenes is a difficult task that requires preserving input shapes, predicting accurate results, and adapting to multi-category data. To address these challenges, we introduce an Unsupervised SymmetricShape-Preserving Autoencoding Network (USSPA) in this paper. Our approach leverages the observation that many natural and man-made objects exhibit symmetries. We incorporate a symmetry learning module into our network to capture and preserve structural symmetries. The USSPA consists of an initial coarse predictor and an upsampling refinement module that iteratively refines the complete shape. Unlike previous methods that train each category separately, our USSPA can handle multi-category data in a single pass through a classifier-guided discriminator. We also contribute a real scene dataset with paired CAD models as ground truth for more accurate evaluation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of our method, with state-of-the-art results in unsupervised completion of real scene objects.
