In this study, we address the challenge of constructing an alternative training set for object re-identification (re-ID) when on-the-fly training data annotation is not feasible. We propose a search and pruning (SnP) solution that aims to find and merge clusters of source identities with similar distributions to the target domain. Then, subject to a budget, we select identities and their images from the output of the search stage to control the size of the training set. Our approach generates training sets that are 80% smaller than the source pool while achieving comparable or even higher re-ID accuracy. These training sets outperform existing search methods such as random sampling and greedy sampling under the same budget constraints. Furthermore, our method demonstrates its effectiveness in bridging the re-ID domain gap. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/yorkeyao/SnP.
