UltraLiDAR is a data-driven framework designed to address the challenges of expensive and sparse LiDAR point clouds. It utilizes a compact and robust representation that encodes the geometric structure of the point cloud, allowing for easy manipulation. By aligning sparse point clouds with dense ones, the framework can densify the data, mimicking the results of high-density LiDAR at a lower cost. Additionally, by learning a prior over the representation, UltraLiDAR can generate diverse and realistic LiDAR point clouds for self-driving purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of perception systems and generates more realistic point clouds compared to previous methods. Human participants preferred the results produced by UltraLiDAR in over 98.5% of A/B tests. For more information, please refer to the project page at https://waabi.ai/research/ultralidar/.
