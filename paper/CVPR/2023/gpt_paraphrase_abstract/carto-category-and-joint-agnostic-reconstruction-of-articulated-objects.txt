We introduce CARTO, an innovative approach to reconstructing multiple articulated objects from a single stereo RGB observation. Our method utilizes implicit object-centric representations and employs a single decoder for both geometry and articulation, catering to various object categories. Despite being trained on multiple categories, our decoder achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy to methods that train separate decoders for each category. Additionally, by combining our stereo image encoder, we can determine the 3D shape, 6D pose, size, joint type, and joint state of multiple unknown objects in a single forward pass. Our approach outperforms a two-stage pipeline by achieving a 20.4% absolute improvement in mAP 3D IOU50 for novel instances. Furthermore, our method exhibits fast inference times, running on an NVIDIA TITAN XP GPU at 1 HZ for up to eight objects. Although trained on simulated data, CARTO successfully transfers to real-world object instances. For access to our code and evaluation data, please visit carto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.
