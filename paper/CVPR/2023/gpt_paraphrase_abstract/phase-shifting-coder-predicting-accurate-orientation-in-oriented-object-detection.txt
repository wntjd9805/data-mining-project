This paper introduces a new angle coding method called phase-shifting coder (PSC) for accurately predicting the orientation of objects in computer vision. A dual-frequency version of PSC (PSCD) is also proposed. By mapping the rotational periodicity of different cycles into the phase of different frequencies, this method provides a unified framework for addressing periodic fuzzy problems caused by rotational symmetry in oriented object detection. This framework elegantly solves common issues like boundary discontinuity and square-like problems in a unified manner. Visual analysis and experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of this approach. When dealing with scenarios that require high-quality bounding boxes, the proposed methods are expected to perform competitively.
