Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an effective technique for determining the 3D structure of biomolecules, particularly large protein complexes and molecular assemblies. Recent advancements in cryo-EM resolution have made it possible to build protein structures from scratch using cryo-EM maps. However, this process is limited by the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) problem. On the other hand, the success of AlphaFold in predicting protein structures has motivated the integration of fragment recognition and structure prediction methods to achieve complete structure building. This study introduces a novel approach called FFF, which combines protein structure recognition with flexible fitting. The method involves a multi-level recognition network to capture various structural features from the input cryo-EM map. Additionally, protein structural fragments are generated using pseudo peptide vectors and a protein sequence alignment method based on these extracted features. Finally, a complete structural model is constructed using the predicted protein fragments through flexible fitting. Benchmark tests demonstrate that FFF outperforms baseline methods in building complete protein structures.
