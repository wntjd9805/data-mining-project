This paper introduces a novel approach to reconstructing RAW images from sRGB images by mapping the 2D coordinates of metadata to their corresponding RAW values conditioned on the sRGB values. Unlike previous methods that rely on metadata, this approach utilizes an implicit neural function to achieve significant performance improvement in reconstructing RAW images. The method is trained in a self-supervised manner and does not require pre-training on different camera ISPs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is also applicable to guided super-resolution tasks.
