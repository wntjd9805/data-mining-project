Current neural scene representations have been successful in parameterizing and reconstructing images. However, these models lack optimization for preserving physical quantities. Although they can accurately reconstruct color images, they struggle with fitting maps of polar quantities, resulting in artifacts. To address this issue, we propose polarimetric coordinate networks (pCON), a new model architecture specifically designed to preserve polarimetric information while accurately parameterizing scenes. Our pCON model successfully eliminates artifacts produced by existing coordinate network architectures when reconstructing three polarimetric quantities of interest.
