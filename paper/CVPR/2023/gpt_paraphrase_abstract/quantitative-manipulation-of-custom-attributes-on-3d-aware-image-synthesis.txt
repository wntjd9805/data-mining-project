The effectiveness of 3D-based GAN techniques in generating realistic 3D images with various attributes and maintaining view consistency has been well-established. However, there has been limited research on how to control 3D images without being restricted to specific object categories or properties. To address this gap, this study presents a novel image manipulation model based on 3D-based GAN representations that allows for fine-grained control of specific custom attributes. By extending existing 3D-based GAN models, such as EG3D, our user-friendly quantitative manipulation model enables precise control of multi-attribute quantities in 3D manipulation while ensuring view consistency. The proposed technique is validated through qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.
