The majority of existing models for salient object detection (SOD) aim to improve overall performance without addressing the difference between training and testing distributions. This study explores a specific type of uncertainty called distributional uncertainty for SOD. It adapts class-aware distribution gap exploration techniques, such as long-tail learning, single-model uncertainty modeling, and test-time strategies, to model distributional uncertainty for a class-agnostic task. The definition of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in SOD differs from the conventional definition, as it refers to samples that violate the basic priors of saliency rather than not belonging to the training categories. The study conducts extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of distribution gap modeling techniques for SOD and finds that train-time single-model uncertainty estimation techniques and weight-regularization solutions are promising approaches for modeling distributional uncertainty in SOD.
