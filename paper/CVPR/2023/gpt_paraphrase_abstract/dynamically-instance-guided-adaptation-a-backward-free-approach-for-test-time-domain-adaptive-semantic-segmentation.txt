This paper focuses on Test-time domain adaptation in semantic segmentation (TTDA-Seg) and addresses the issues of low efficiency and lack of semantic adaptation in existing methods. The proposed approach, called Dynamically Instance-Guided Adaptation (DIGA), aims to overcome these problems by utilizing each instance to guide its own adaptation in a non-parametric way. DIGA consists of a distribution adaptation module (DAM) and a semantic adaptation module (SAM), which jointly adapt the model in two essential aspects. DAM combines instance and source batch normalization (BN) statistics to improve the model's robustness, while SAM adjusts semantic predictions using historical and instance-level prototypes, benefiting the final results. The effectiveness and efficiency of DIGA are demonstrated through extensive experiments on five target domains, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in TTDA-Seg. The source code for DIGA is available at the provided link.
