Recently, there has been a growing need for real-time super-resolution networks on mobile devices. Various lightweight super-resolution models have been proposed to address this demand. However, these models still have time-consuming components that increase inference latency, limiting their practical use on mobile devices. In this study, we introduce a new model for single-image super-resolution called Equivalent Transformation and Dual Stream network construction (ETDS). The ET method is used to transform time-consuming operators into more efficient operations, such as convolution and ReLU, on mobile devices. Additionally, a dual stream network is designed to reduce redundant parameters resulting from the use of the ET method and enhance feature extraction capabilities. By leveraging the advancements of the ET method and the dual stream network structure, we have developed the efficientSR model ETDS specifically for mobile devices. Experimental results show that our ETDS model achieves faster inference speed and superior reconstruction quality compared to previous lightweight super-resolution methods on mobile devices.
