Inferring human motion from RGB images is difficult due to the uncertainty involved in predicting such movements. However, thermal images offer a solution as they capture traces of past human-object interactions through thermal radiation measurement. Acknowledging this, we have constructed the first-ever RGB-Thermal dataset called Thermal-IM for the purpose of analyzing human motion. We have also developed a three-stage neural network model that accurately estimates past human poses. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that incorporating thermal cues significantly reduces the ambiguities in this task, and our proposed model achieves remarkable performance. The dataset and the model can be accessed at https://github.com/ZitianTang/Thermal-IM.
