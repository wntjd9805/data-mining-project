We address the issue of low azimuth (angular dimension) resolution in Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. FMCW MIMO radar is commonly used in autonomous driving, but its resolution is often limited due to hardware constraints. This means that accurately estimating the location and velocity of objects is challenging. To enhance the azimuth resolution of MIMO radar, we propose an Analog-to-Digital super-resolution model (ADC-SR) that generates additional radar signals using data from a small number of receivers. Our ADC-SR method outperforms baseline models applied to processed radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) maps, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer parameters (98% fewer). Additionally, we introduce a hybrid super-resolution model (Hybrid-SR) that combines ADC-SR with a standard RAD super-resolution model, resulting in further performance improvements. Our experiments on the Pitt-Radar dataset and the RADIal dataset confirm the importance of utilizing raw radar ADC signals. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of our super-resolution model on object detection for autonomous driving and observe a 4% increase in mean average precision (mAP). The Pitt-Radar dataset and code will be made available.
