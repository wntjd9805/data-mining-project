Deep learning models for image recognition perform poorly on low-quality images because they are trained on high-quality images. Existing solutions, such as image restoration and domain adaptation, do not effectively address the issue. In this study, we propose a Visual Recognition-Driven Image Restoration network, called VRD-IR, which aims to recover high-quality images from various unknown corruption types while considering visual recognition. Our approach dynamically harmonizes the semantic representations of degraded images and optimizes them for semantic recovery. We also introduce a prior-ascribing optimization strategy to improve compatibility with downstream recognition tasks. VRD-IR is versatile and can be used as an image enhancement module in different recognition tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRD-IR outperforms existing image restoration methods and achieves superior performance in classification, detection, and person re-identification tasks.
