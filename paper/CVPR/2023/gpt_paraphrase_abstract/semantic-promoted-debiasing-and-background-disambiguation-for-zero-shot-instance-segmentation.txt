Zero-shot instance segmentation is the task of accurately detecting and segmenting objects that belong to categories unseen during training. However, current models tend to classify all objects into categories that they have seen before, leading to a bias towards these seen categories. Additionally, there is often confusion between background and novel objects that have never been encountered in training, making it difficult to accurately identify and segment novel objects.To address these challenges, we propose a method called D2Zero with Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation. The Semantic-Promoted Debiasing approach leverages the semantic relationships between different classes to involve unseen categories in the training of visual features. It also learns an input-conditional classifier that dynamically classifies objects based on the input image. This helps to rescue novel objects from being misclassified into seen categories.The Background Disambiguation technique generates image-adaptive representations of the background, which helps to avoid mistaking novel objects for background. By combining these two approaches, we significantly improve the performance of zero-shot instance segmentation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method achieves a 16.86% improvement on the COCO dataset.In summary, our proposed method, D2Zero with Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation, effectively addresses the challenges of zero-shot instance segmentation by involving unseen categories in training and accurately distinguishing novel objects from background. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods.
