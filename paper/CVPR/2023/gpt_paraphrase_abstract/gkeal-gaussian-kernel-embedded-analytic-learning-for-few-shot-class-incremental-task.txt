This paper introduces Gaussian kernel embedded analytic learning (GKEAL), a technique for addressing catastrophic forgetting during class incremental learning in a few-shot learning setting. The approach is inspired by the fact that analytic learning, which converts network training into linear problems, produces identical weights to training on the entire dataset at once. This similarity to the FSCIL setting and its goal of avoiding catastrophic forgetting led to the development of GKEAL. The key components of GKEAL are the kernel analytic module, which enables recursive learning, and the augmented feature concatenation module, which effectively balances the preference between old and new tasks in the few-shot setting. Experimental results demonstrate that GKEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets.
