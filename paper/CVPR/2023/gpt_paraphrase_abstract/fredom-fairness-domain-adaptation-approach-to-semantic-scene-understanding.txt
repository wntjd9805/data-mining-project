Despite recent advancements in Domain Adaptation in Semantic Scene Segmentation, there is a lack of well-defined and addressed fairness concerns in this domain. Fairness is crucial when deploying segmentation models in real-world applications like autonomous driving as unfair predictions can impact human safety. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Fairness Domain Adaptation (FREDOM) for semantic scene segmentation. Our approach introduces a fairness objective and a new adaptation framework that treats class distributions fairly. Additionally, we introduce a conditional structural constraint to ensure consistency in predicted segmentation by modeling the context of structural dependency. Our Conditional Structure Network utilizes a self-attention mechanism to effectively capture the structural information of segmentation. Through ablation studies, our proposed method demonstrates improved performance of segmentation models and promotes fairness in model predictions. Experimental results on standard benchmarks (SYNTHIA →Cityscapes and GTA5 → Cityscapes) show that our method achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance.
