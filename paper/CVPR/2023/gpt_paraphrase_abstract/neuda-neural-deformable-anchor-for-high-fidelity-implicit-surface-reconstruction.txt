This study examines the use of differentiable ray casting for implicit surface reconstruction. Previous approaches, such as IDR and NeuS, overlook the spatial context in 3D space when predicting and rendering the surface, which can lead to difficulties in capturing sharp local topologies like small holes and structures. To address this limitation, we propose a flexible neural implicit representation called NeuDA, which leverages hierarchical voxel grids. In NeuDA, each vertex stores a 3D position (or anchor) instead of the direct embedding, allowing for adaptive encoding of different local geometry structures. Additionally, we explore frequency encoding strategies and introduce a hierarchical positional encoding method to effectively utilize the properties of high-frequency and low-frequency geometry and appearance. Experimental results on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets demonstrate that NeuDA is capable of generating high-quality mesh surfaces.
