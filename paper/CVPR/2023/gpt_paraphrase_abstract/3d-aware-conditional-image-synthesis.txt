We introduce pix2pix3D, a novel approach for generating photorealistic images with 3D control. Our model utilizes 2D label maps to synthesize corresponding images from various perspectives. To achieve explicit 3D user manipulation, we incorporate neural radiance fields into conditional generative models. By leveraging monocular image and label map pairs, our model learns to assign labels to each 3D point, enabling simultaneous rendering of images and pixel-aligned label maps. Additionally, we develop an interactive system that enables users to edit label maps from different viewpoints and generate corresponding outputs.
