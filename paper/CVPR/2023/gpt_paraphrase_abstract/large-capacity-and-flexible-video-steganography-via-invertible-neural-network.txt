This paper introduces a novel approach called Large-capacity and Flexible Video Steganography Network (LF-VSN) to address the limitations of existing video steganography methods. The proposed LF-VSN utilizes a reversible pipeline and an invertible neural network (INN) to enable the hiding and recovery of multiple secret videos within a single cover video. The method allows for the hiding and recovery of up to 7 secret videos with promising performance. Additionally, the LF-VSN incorporates a key-controllable scheme, allowing different recipients to recover specific secret videos using specific keys. Furthermore, the method introduces a scalable strategy for hiding multiple videos, enabling the hiding of variable numbers of secret videos in a cover video using a single model and training session. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LF-VSN achieves high security, large hiding capacity, and flexibility in video steganography.
