Accurate detection of facial landmarks in uncontrolled images is crucial for various applications such as human-computer interaction, entertainment, and medical fields. However, existing methods have limitations in maintaining 3D consistency while detecting 3D/2D facial landmarks due to the lack of diverse training data. Fortunately, advancements in generative visual models and neural rendering have enabled the synthesis of high-quality 3D images. In this study, we leverage these advancements to create a synthetic dataset and propose a novel multi-view consistent learning strategy to improve the accuracy of 3D facial landmark detection in uncontrolled images. Our proposed 3D-aware module can be integrated into any learning-based landmark detection algorithm to enhance its accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art methods on various real and synthetic datasets.
