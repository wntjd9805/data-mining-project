In recent years, there has been significant interest in training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect infrared small targets. However, this approach is labor-intensive as it requires a large number of per-pixel annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS). Instead of using per-pixel annotations, we train the CNNs using point-level supervision. During training, we observe that the CNNs first learn to segment a cluster of pixels near the targets before converging to predict groundtruth point labels. This phenomenon, which we refer to as "mapping degeneration," motivates us to develop the LESP framework. LESP progressively expands the point labels by leveraging the intermediate predictions of the CNNs. This allows the network predictions to approximate the updated pseudo labels, and a pixel-level target mask can be obtained to train the CNNs in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments and provide visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results show that CNNs equipped with LESP can accurately recover target masks from point labels, achieving over 70% and 95% of their fully supervised performance in terms of pixel-level intersection over union and object-level probability of detection, respectively. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/XinyiYing/LESPS.
