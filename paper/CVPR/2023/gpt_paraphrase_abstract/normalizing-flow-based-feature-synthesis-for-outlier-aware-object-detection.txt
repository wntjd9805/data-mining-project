Effective deployment of reliable object detectors is essential for various applications, including autonomous driving. However, commonly used object detectors like Faster R-CNN often produce overly confident predictions for outlier objects. Recent approaches for outlier-aware object detection address this issue by estimating the density of instance-wide features using class-conditional Gaussians and training on synthesized outlier features from low-likelihood regions. Nevertheless, this strategy does not guarantee that the synthesized outlier features will have a low likelihood according to the other class-conditional Gaussians. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel outlier-aware object detection framework. Our framework distinguishes outliers from inlier objects by learning the joint data distribution of all inlier classes with an invertible normalizing flow. By appropriately sampling the flow model, we ensure that the synthesized outliers have a lower likelihood than inliers of all object classes, thereby improving the decision boundary between inlier and outlier objects. Our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods for outlier-aware object detection, demonstrating superior performance on both image and video datasets.
