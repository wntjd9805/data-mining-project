The dual-pixel (DP) sensor captures two views of an image in a single shot by splitting each pixel. The defocus blurred regions between the two views have disparity, while the sharp regions have no disparity. This has led to the development of a framework called K3DN for deblurring DP pairs. The framework consists of three modules: a disparity-aware deblur module, a reblurring regularization module, and a sharp region preservation module. The disparity-aware deblur module estimates a disparity feature map and uses it to find the best blur kernel for deblurring. The reblurring regularization module uses the estimated kernel for reblurring and also regularizes the kernel and disparity feature. The sharp region preservation module identifies the in-focus regions with zero disparity and aims to improve image restoration performance by avoiding noise introduction. Experimental results on four DP datasets demonstrate that K3DN outperforms existing methods with fewer parameters and computational operations.
