The search for panoramic image semantic segmentation has been hindered by distortion in the equirectangular projection (ERP) and a lack of pixel-wise annotations. To address this, some studies have used unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to transfer knowledge from pinhole images to ERP images. However, these approaches struggle with the domain gaps caused by differences in camera sensors and image formats. In this paper, we propose a new dual-path UDA framework called DPPASS, which takes ERP and tangent projection (TP) images as inputs. To reduce domain gaps, we introduce cross-projection and intra-projection training. Cross-projection training involves training the models to be aware of distortion by formulating features with the same projection locations as positive examples and vice versa. Prediction consistency training ensures the consistency of predictions between the ERP and TP models. Additionally, we propose adversarial intra-projection training to reduce the inherent gap between pinhole images and ERP/TP images. Importantly, the TP path can be removed after training without incurring additional inference cost. Our experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DPPASS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with a +1.06% mIoU increment.
