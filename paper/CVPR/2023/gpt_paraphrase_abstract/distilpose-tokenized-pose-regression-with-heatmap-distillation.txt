This paper introduces a new framework called Distil-Pose for human pose estimation that combines the strengths of heatmap-based and regression-based methods. The framework maximizes knowledge transfer from a heatmap-based teacher model to a regression-based student model through the use of a Token-distilling Encoder (TDE) and Simulated Heatmaps. TDE aligns the feature spaces of the two models by introducing tokenization, while Simulated Heatmaps transfer explicit guidance from the teacher heatmaps to the student models. Experimental results demonstrate that Distil-Pose significantly improves the performance of regression-based models while maintaining efficiency. DistilPose-S achieves 71.6% mAP on the MSCOCO validation dataset with 5.36M parameters, 2.38 GFLOPs, and 40.2 FPS, resulting in savings of computational cost and improved speed compared to the teacher model. DistilPose-L achieves a new state-of-the-art performance among regression-based models with 74.4% mAP on the MSCOCO validation dataset.
