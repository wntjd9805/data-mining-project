This study focuses on anonymizing the identity of faces in a dataset of images to protect privacy while maintaining the usefulness of the dataset for machine learning models. The researchers address the limitations of existing approaches, which either require training additional neural networks or fail to retain facial attributes in the anonymized images. They propose a task-agnostic method that optimizes the latent representation of images in a pre-trained GAN's latent space. This approach ensures that the anonymized images have a desired distance from the original identity while preserving facial attributes using a novel feature-matching loss. The researchers conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in anonymizing identities while better preserving facial attributes. The code and pre-trained models are publicly available at a specified GitHub repository.
