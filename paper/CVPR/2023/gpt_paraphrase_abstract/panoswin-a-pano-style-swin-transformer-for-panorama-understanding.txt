This paper introduces PanoSwin, a new architecture designed to improve panorama understanding using the equirectangular projection (ERP). The ERP suffers from boundary discontinuity and spatial distortion, which negatively impact the performance of conventional CNNs and vision Transformers on panoramas. To address these challenges, PanoSwin incorporates a pano-style shift windowing scheme and novel pitch attention to handle boundary discontinuity and spatial distortion, respectively. Additionally, PanoSwin utilizes absolute positional embeddings and relative positional biases based on spherical distance and Cartesian coordinates to enhance the panoramic geometry information. Recognizing that planar image understanding may share common knowledge with panorama understanding, the paper proposes a two-stage learning framework to facilitate knowledge transfer from planar images to panoramas. The effectiveness of PanoSwin is evaluated through experiments on various panoramic tasks, including panoramic object detection, panoramic classification, and panoramic layout estimation. The experimental results affirm the superior performance of PanoSwin in panorama understanding.
