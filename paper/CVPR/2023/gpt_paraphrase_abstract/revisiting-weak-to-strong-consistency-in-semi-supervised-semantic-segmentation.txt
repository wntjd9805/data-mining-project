This study explores the weak-to-strong consistency framework, originally introduced by FixMatch in semi-supervised classification, where a weakly perturbed image is used to supervise its strongly perturbed version. The authors find that this simple pipeline produces competitive results in the segmentation scenario when compared to recent advanced methods. However, the success of this approach relies heavily on manually designed strong data augmentations, which may limit the exploration of a wider perturbation space. To address this limitation, the authors propose an auxiliary feature perturbation stream to expand the perturbation space. Additionally, they present a dual-stream perturbation technique that enables two strong views to be guided by a common weak view, allowing for a thorough exploration of original image-level augmentations. The proposed approach, named UnifiedDual-Stream Perturbations (UniMatch), outperforms existing methods across various evaluation protocols on the Pascal, Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks. The superiority of UniMatch is also demonstrated in remote sensing interpretation and medical image analysis. The authors hope that their reproduction of FixMatch and their results will inspire future research in this area.
