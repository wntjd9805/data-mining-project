This study explores the use of signed distance functions (SDFs) for 3D shape reconstruction from images, a framework that has shown promise but lacks explicit modeling of 3D geometry. The researchers propose leveraging hand structure as guidance for SDF-based shape reconstruction, specifically focusing on reconstructing hands and manipulated objects from monocular RGB images. They estimate poses of hands and objects and utilize them to guide the 3D reconstruction process. Additionally, they predict kinematic chains of pose transformations and align SDFs with highly-articulated hand poses to improve visual features. They also incorporate temporal information to enhance robustness against occlusion and motion blurs. The proposed method is evaluated on the ObMan and DexYCB benchmarks, showcasing significant improvements over existing techniques.
