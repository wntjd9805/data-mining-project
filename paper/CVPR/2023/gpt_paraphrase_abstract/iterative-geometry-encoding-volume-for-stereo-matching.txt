We propose a new deep network architecture called IGEV-Stereo for stereo matching. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating non-local geometry knowledge and tackling local ambiguities. Our approach utilizes an iterative process to update the disparity map using a combined geometry encoding volume that captures context information and local matching details. To accelerate convergence, we employ GEV to regress an accurate starting point for the iterations. Our IGEV-Stereo outperforms other methods on KITTI 2015 and 2012 (Reflective) benchmarks and is the fastest among the top 10 methods. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization and high inference efficiency. We extend our IGEV approach to multi-view stereo (MVS) and achieve competitive accuracy on the DTU benchmark. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/gangweiX/IGEV.
