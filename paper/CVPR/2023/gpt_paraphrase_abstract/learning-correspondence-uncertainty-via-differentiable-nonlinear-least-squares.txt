We propose a novel framework for estimating the relative pose from feature correspondences, taking into account uncertainty. Our approach involves introducing a symmetric version of the probabilistic normal epipolar constraint and estimating the covariance of feature positions by differentiating through the camera pose estimation procedure. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on synthetic data as well as real-world datasets (KITTI and EuRoC). The results on the synthetic dataset demonstrate that our learned covariances accurately approximate the true noise distribution. In real-world experiments, our approach consistently outperforms both non-probabilistic and probabilistic state-of-the-art methods, regardless of the chosen feature extraction algorithm.
