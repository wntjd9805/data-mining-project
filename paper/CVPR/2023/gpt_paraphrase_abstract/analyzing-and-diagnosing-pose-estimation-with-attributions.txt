We introduce Pose Integrated Gradient (PoseIG), a novel interpretability technique specifically developed for pose estimation. By expanding on the concept of integrated gradients, we are able to generate attribution maps at the pixel level for pose estimation. In order to facilitate comparison between different pose frameworks, we bring together various pose outputs into a standardized output space, accompanied by a likelihood approximation function for gradient back-propagation. Additionally, we propose three indices for quantitative analysis to complement the qualitative insights provided by the attribution maps. These tools allow us to systematically compare different pose estimation frameworks, enabling us to gain a better understanding of the effects of network design, backbone, and auxiliary tasks. Through our analysis, we discover an interesting shortcut involving the knuckles (MCP joints) in hand pose estimation, as well as an overlooked inversion error in keypoints for body pose estimation.
