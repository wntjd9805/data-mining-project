Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a novel and challenging task in computer vision that bridges the gap between traditional object detection (OD) benchmarks and object detection in real-world scenarios. In addition to detecting and classifying known objects, OWOD algorithms are expected to identify and incrementally learn about novel or unknown objects. Unlike standard OD, where object proposals not overlapping with labeled objects are automatically classified as background, OWOD methods fail to accurately detect unknown objects as they would be classified as background. Previous approaches have tried to tackle this issue by generating pseudo-labels for unknown objects, but the detection performance remains low. To address this challenge, we propose a new probabilistic framework for estimating objectness, which alternates between estimating probability distributions and maximizing the likelihood of known objects in the embedded feature space. This allows us to estimate the objectness probability of different proposals. Our resulting Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector, PROB, integrates this framework into traditional object detection models, making them suitable for the open-world setting. Through extensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks, we demonstrate that PROB outperforms existing methods in both unknown object detection (approximately 2 times higher unknown recall) and known object detection (approximately 10% higher mean average precision). The code for PROB is publicly available on GitHub. Figure 1 illustrates a comparison of PROB with other open-world object detectors, highlighting PROB's probabilistic objectness training and revised inference scheme, as well as qualitative examples of improved unknown object detection on the MS-COCO test set.
