This paper introduces Mask DINO, a comprehensive framework for object detection and segmentation. Mask DINO builds upon DINO (DETR with Improved Denoising Anchor Boxes) by incorporating a mask prediction branch that supports various image segmentation tasks, including instance, panoptic, and semantic segmentation. By utilizing the query embeddings from DINO, Mask DINO employs a high-resolution pixel embedding map to generate a set of binary masks through dot-product operations. Several key components of DINO are expanded to support segmentation using a shared architecture and training process. Mask DINO is designed to be simple, efficient, and scalable, and it can leverage large-scale detection and segmentation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Mask DINO outperforms existing specialized segmentation methods on both ResNet-50 and pre-trained SwinL backbones. Notably, Mask DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance on instance segmentation (54.5 AP on COCO), panoptic segmentation (59.4 PQ on COCO), and semantic segmentation (60.8 mIoU on ADE20K) among models with less than one billion parameters.
