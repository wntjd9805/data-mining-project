Object detection models in practical applications are often hindered by domain shift, where the performance deteriorates. Previous efforts have focused on decoupling and learning domain-invariant features through domain adversarial learning (DAL) to mitigate the impact of domain shift. However, these methods have overlooked the implicit non-causal factors present in the common features, primarily due to the single-view nature of DAL. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that removes non-causal factors from common features using multi-view adversarial training on source domains. We observed that these insignificant non-causal factors may still hold significance in other latent spaces (views) due to the multi-mode structure of the data. Our proposed Multi-view Adversarial Discriminator (MAD) based domain generalization model consists of a Spurious Correlations Generator (SCG) that enhances the diversity of the source domain through random augmentation, and a Multi-View Domain Classifier (MVDC) that maps features to multiple latent spaces. This mapping effectively eliminates non-causal factors and purifies the domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmarks demonstrate that our MAD model achieves state-of-the-art performance.
