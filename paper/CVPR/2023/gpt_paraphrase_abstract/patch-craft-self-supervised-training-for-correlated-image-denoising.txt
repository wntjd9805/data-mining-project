Supervised neural networks have shown impressive results in image restoration tasks, but they rely on datasets containing pairs of corrupted images and their corresponding clean versions. Unfortunately, such datasets are not always available. To address this issue in the context of image denoising, self-supervised training methods have been proposed. However, some of these methods require knowledge of the noise model or assume uncorrelated noise, which limits their practicality. This study introduces a new self-supervised training technique for removing unknown correlated noise. Unlike existing methods, our approach does not require knowledge of the noise model or access to clean images. Instead, it utilizes bursts of noisy shots to create artificial patch-craft images through patch matching and stitching, which are then used as training targets. Importantly, our method does not require image registration within the burst. We evaluate the proposed framework extensively using both synthetic and real image noise.
