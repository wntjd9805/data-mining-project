This paper introduces a new method for 4K video frame interpolation called BiFormer. The method involves three steps: global motion estimation, local motion refinement, and frame synthesis. In the first step, a bilateral motion field is predicted at a coarse scale using the BiFormer, which is the first transformer-based bilateral motion estimator. The second step involves efficiently refining the global motion fields using blockwise bilateral cost volumes (BBCVs). Finally, the input frames are warped using the refined motion fields and blended to synthesize an intermediate frame. Extensive experiments show that the proposed BiFormer algorithm achieves excellent interpolation performance on 4K datasets.
