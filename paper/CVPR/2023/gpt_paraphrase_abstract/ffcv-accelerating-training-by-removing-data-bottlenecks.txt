FFCV is a library designed to facilitate and accelerate the training of machine learning models. It achieves this by addressing data bottlenecks that often hinder the training process. By employing various techniques, such as efficient file storage, caching, data pre-loading, asynchronous data transfer, and just-in-time compilation, FFCV significantly improves data loading and transfer efficiency. This ensures that GPUs are fully utilized and allows for offloading as much data processing as possible to the CPU, freeing up GPU cycles for training.To demonstrate the effectiveness of FFCV, we conducted experiments using ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset. Our results show that FFCV achieves a state-of-the-art tradeoff between accuracy and training time. For instance, when compared to other baseline models, FFCV achieves the same level of accuracy in half the time for the range of ResNet-50 models tested.We also highlight FFCV's performance, ease-of-use, extensibility, and ability to adapt to resource constraints through several case studies. To further support users, we provide detailed installation instructions, documentation, and a Slack support channel, all of which can be accessed at https://ffcv.io/.
