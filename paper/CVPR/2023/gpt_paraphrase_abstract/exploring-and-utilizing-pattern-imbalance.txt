This paper focuses on addressing pattern imbalance and spurious correlation in datasets. Unlike previous methods that primarily consider category or domain granularity, this study introduces a new training scheme that takes into account the finer structure within datasets. It defines a seed category as the optimal unit for distinguishing different patterns within the same category or domain. Through extensive experiments on various domain generalization datasets, the proposed method proves to be effective in mitigating these issues.
