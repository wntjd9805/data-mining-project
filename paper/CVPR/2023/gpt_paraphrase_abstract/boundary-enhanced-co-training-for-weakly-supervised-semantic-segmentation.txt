This study compares the performance of weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods on the VOC12 dataset. While current methods focus on generating accurate and complete class activation maps (CAMs) as pseudo-labels, they neglect the importance of training the segmentation networks. The researchers observe an inconsistency between the quality of the CAMs and the final segmentation model's performance, with mislabeled pixels predominantly found in the boundary areas. Based on these observations, the researchers propose a shift in focus towards robust learning with noisy pseudo-labels and introduce a boundary-enhanced co-training (BECO) method for training the segmentation model. The BECO method involves employing a co-training paradigm with two interactive networks to improve the learning of uncertain pixels. Additionally, a boundary-enhanced strategy is proposed to enhance the prediction of difficult boundary areas by utilizing reliable predictions to create artificial boundaries. The combination of co-training and boundary enhancement in the BECO method achieves promising segmentation performance for different CAMs. Extensive experiments conducted on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets confirm the superiority of BECO over other state-of-the-art methods.
