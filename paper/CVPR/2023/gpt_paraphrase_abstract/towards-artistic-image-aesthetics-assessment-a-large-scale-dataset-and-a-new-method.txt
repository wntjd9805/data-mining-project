Image aesthetics assessment is a difficult task due to its subjective nature. Most current studies use large datasets to learn a general model for all types of photography images. However, there is a lack of research on measuring the aesthetic quality of artistic images, and existing datasets have limited artworks. This poses a challenge for assessing the aesthetics of artistic images. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset called Boldbrush Artistic Image Dataset (BAID), which includes 60,337 artistic images of various art forms and has received over 360,000 votes from online users. We also propose a new method called SAAN (Style-specific Art Assessment Network) that effectively extracts and utilizes style-specific and generic aesthetic information to evaluate artistic images. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods on the BAID dataset. We believe that our dataset and method can serve as a foundation for future research in artistic image aesthetics assessment and inspire further studies in this field.
