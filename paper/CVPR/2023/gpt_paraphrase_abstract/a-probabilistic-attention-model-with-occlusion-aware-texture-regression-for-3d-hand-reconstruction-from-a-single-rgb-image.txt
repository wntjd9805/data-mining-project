Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promising outcomes in reconstructing 3D hand structures from a single RGB image. These approaches can be categorized into two types: model-based and model-free. Model-based approaches heavily rely on the parameters of the model, while model-free approaches require a substantial amount of 3D ground truth data to address depth ambiguity and struggle in weakly-supervised scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel probabilistic model that combines the strengths of both model-based and model-free approaches. Our proposed model integrates a model-based network as a prior-net to estimate the prior probability distribution of joints and vertices. Additionally, we introduce an Attention-based Mesh Vertices Uncertainty Regression (AMVUR) model to capture dependencies among vertices and the correlation between joints and mesh vertices, enhancing their feature representation. Moreover, we present a learning-based occlusion-aware Hand Texture Regression model to achieve high-quality texture reconstruction. Our proposed probabilistic model exhibits flexibility and can be trained in both supervised and weakly-supervised scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our probabilistic model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reconstructing 3D hand structures and textures from a single image, even in the presence of severe occlusions.
