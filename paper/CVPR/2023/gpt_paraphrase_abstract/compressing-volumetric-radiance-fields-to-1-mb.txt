This paper introduces a framework called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF) for compressing volume-grid-based radiance fields. Existing methods for approximating radiance fields with discretized volumetric grids, such as DVGO, Plenoxels, and TensoRF, have shown fast training convergence and real-time rendering capabilities but require significant storage overhead. VQRF addresses this issue by implementing a robust metric for estimating redundancy in grid models and performing voxel pruning. Additionally, a trainable vector quantization technique is proposed to enhance the compactness of grid models. Through an efficient joint tuning strategy and post-processing, VQRF achieves a compression ratio of 100Ã—, reducing the overall model size to 1 MB with minimal loss in visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization capabilities of VQRF across various volumetric structures, making it suitable for real-world applications.
