This paper explores the concept of multimodal alignment, which involves retrieving instances from one modality by using another modality. Specifically, the study focuses on aligning assembly diagrams (commonly found in Ikea assembly manuals) with segments from real-world videos that demonstrate the assembly actions. The authors propose a supervised contrastive learning approach that effectively aligns videos with the intricate details of assembly diagrams. To evaluate their method, they introduce a new dataset called IAW (Ikea assembly in the wild), which includes 183 hours of videos from various furniture assembly collections and approximately 8,300 illustrations from their corresponding instruction manuals, all annotated for ground truth alignments. Two tasks are defined on this dataset: nearest neighbor retrieval between video segments and illustrations, and alignment of instruction steps with video segments. Extensive experiments conducted on the IAW dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms alternative methods.
