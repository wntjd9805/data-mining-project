State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are typically trained on large-scale datasets with high-quality 3D annotations. However, acquiring these annotations is expensive and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. To address this issue, semi-supervised learning (SSL) can be used by utilizing a limited number of labeled samples along with numerous unlabeled samples. Current SSL object detection methods based on pseudo-labeling mostly employ a teacher-student framework, which generates supervision signals using a single fixed threshold strategy. However, this approach often leads to confused supervision during the training of the student network. Additionally, the data augmentation techniques used in the teacher-student framework for point cloud data are limited, hindering the effective learning of feature information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach called Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data Augmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student framework. In HSSDA, the teacher network generates more accurate supervision for the student network by employing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Furthermore, we introduce a shuffle data augmentation strategy to enhance the feature representation ability of the student network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSSDA consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods on various datasets. The code for HSSDA will be made available at https://github.com/azhuantou/HSSDA.
