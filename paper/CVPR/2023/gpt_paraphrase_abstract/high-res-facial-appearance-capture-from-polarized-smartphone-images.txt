We present a new technique for reconstructing high-quality facial textures from RGB images using a unique capturing process involving a single smartphone equipped with an inexpensive polarization foil. By converting the flashlight into a polarized light source and placing a polarization filter on the camera, we capture the subject's face with both cross-polarized and parallel-polarized light. Two short sequences are recorded for each subject in a dark setting under flash illumination with different light polarization settings using the modified smartphone. From these observations, we generate a detailed surface mesh of the face using structure from motion. To enhance the facial textures, we utilize a differentiable renderer that takes into account the camera and light co-location, employing an analysis-by-synthesis approach. Our method focuses on optimizing the textures for high-resolution normal textures, diffuse albedo, and specular albedo through a coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. The textures obtained through this optimization process can be seamlessly integrated into a standard rendering pipeline, enabling the synthesis of realistic 3D digital humans in various environments. The data used for this research was captured at the Technical University of Munich.
