In recent years, there has been significant progress in Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which has the potential to reduce the need for extensive data acquisition. Few-shot fine-tuning has proven to be efficient and useful, particularly for out-of-distribution data. However, we have observed that the existing few-shot fine-tuned methods suffer from imbalanced class marginal distribution, resulting in imbalanced per-class testing accuracy. This observation has motivated us to propose a new approach called Transductive Fine-tuning with Margin-based uncertainty weighting and Probability regularization (TF-MP). Our proposed method aims to learn a more balanced class marginal distribution. We achieve this by conducting sample weighting on unlabeled testing data using margin-based uncertainty scores, and further regularizing the categorical probability of each test sample. Our TF-MP approach outperforms previous transductive methods by a significant margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in- and out-of-distribution evaluations using the Meta-Dataset.
