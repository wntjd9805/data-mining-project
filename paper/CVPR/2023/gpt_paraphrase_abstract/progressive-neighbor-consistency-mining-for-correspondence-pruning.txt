Correspondence pruning is a technique used to identify accurate correspondences from initial ones in feature matching tasks. Previous methods have relied on searching for neighbors in both coordinate and feature spaces. However, ensuring consistent neighbors is challenging due to the irregular distribution of false correspondences. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that uses a weighted global graph to search for consistent neighbors. This graph allows us to explicitly explore long-range dependencies among correspondences. Additionally, we construct three neighbor embeddings based on different search spaces and use a Neighbor Consistency block to extract neighbor context and explore their interactions sequentially. Our approach, called Neighbor Consistency Mining Network (NCMNet), accurately recovers camera poses and identifies inliers. Experimental results demonstrate that NCMNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in challenging outdoor and indoor matching scenes.
