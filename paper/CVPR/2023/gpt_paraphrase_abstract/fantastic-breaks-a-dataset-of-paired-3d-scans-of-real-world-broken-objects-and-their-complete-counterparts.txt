Automated methods for repairing damaged shapes lack access to real-world datasets. We introduce the dataset Fantastic Breaks, which includes 3D meshes of 150 broken objects along with their intact counterparts. These meshes are scanned, waterproofed, and cleaned. Fantastic Breaks provides class and material labels, proxy repair parts, and annotated fracture boundaries. We compare Fantastic Breaks with synthetic fracture datasets generated using different methods, highlighting the unique aspects of our dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of Fantastic Breaks for shape repair evaluation, employing learning-based approaches trained on synthetic datasets and then retrained using a subset of Fantastic Breaks.
