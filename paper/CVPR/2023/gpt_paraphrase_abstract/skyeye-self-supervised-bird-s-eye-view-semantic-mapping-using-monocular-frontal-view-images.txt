We propose a self-supervised approach for generating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) semantic maps using a single monocular image from the frontal view (FV). This overcomes the need for large amounts of annotated BEV data. Our approach, called SkyEye, utilizes two modes of self-supervision: implicit supervision and explicit supervision. Implicit supervision enforces spatial consistency of the scene over time based on FV semantic sequences, while explicit supervision utilizes BEV pseudolabels generated from FV semantic annotations and self-supervised depth estimates. Our evaluations on the KITTI-360 dataset show that our self-supervised approach performs comparably to fully supervised methods, using only 1% of direct supervision in BEV. We also release our code and the BEV datasets generated from the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets.
