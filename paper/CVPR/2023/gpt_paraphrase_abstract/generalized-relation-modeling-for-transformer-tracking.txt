The recent one-stream tracking pipeline has shown significant improvement compared to previous two-stream trackers by allowing earlier interaction between the template and search region. However, existing one-stream trackers have the drawback of letting the template interact with all parts inside the search region, which can result in confusion between the target and background when the extracted feature representations are not discriminative enough. To address this issue, we propose a generalized relation modeling method based on adaptive token division. This method combines the benefits of both previous two-stream and one-stream pipelines while enabling more flexible relation modeling by selecting appropriate search tokens to interact with template tokens. We introduce an attention masking strategy and the Gumbel-Softmax technique to facilitate parallel computation and end-to-end learning of the token division module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both two-stream and one-stream pipelines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on six challenging benchmarks with real-time running speed. The code and models for our method are publicly available at https://github.com/Little-Podi/GRM.
