To generate accurate visualizations of human faces, it is necessary to capture both the overall structure and minute details of facial geometry and appearance. However, current methods either rely on large amounts of inaccessible data or fail to capture fine details due to limitations in geometric face models. To address this, we propose a novel approach that combines traditional computer graphics techniques with sparse extreme poses to model unseen expressions. By measuring local changes in facial volume and reproducing similar appearances, our method can generate realistic visualizations of unseen expressions while preserving fine-grained effects and extending beyond facial applications.
