Semi-supervised learning has achieved success in natural image segmentation but remains a challenge in medical images. Contrastive Learning (CL) frameworks are effective for classification but struggle with accurate pixel-level segmentation. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised patch-based CL framework for medical image segmentation. We combine CL and SemiSL by using pseudo-labels from SemiSL to guide CL and leveraging discriminative class information from CL for accurate multi-class segmentation. We also introduce a new loss function that promotes inter-class separability and intra-class compactness in the learned representations. Furthermore, we employ a novel inter-patch semantic disparity mapping using average patch entropy to guide the sampling of positives and negatives in our CL framework. Experimental analysis on publicly available datasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code for our method is available on GitHub.
