The goal of object re-identification (ReID) is to identify instances with the same identity as a given probe from a large gallery. Pairwise losses are important in training a strong ReID network. However, existing pairwise losses sample triplets in a dense manner, which leads to the inclusion of positive pairs that have few visual similarities. This can be detrimental to the training process. To tackle this issue, we propose a new loss paradigm called Sparse Pairwise (SP) loss, which only utilizes a few appropriate pairs for each class in a mini-batch. We empirically demonstrate that this approach is effective for ReID tasks. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive positive mining strategy based on the proposed loss framework. This strategy can dynamically adapt to intra-class variations. Through extensive experiments, we show that SP loss and its adaptive variant, AdaSP loss, outperform other pairwise losses and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various ReID benchmarks.
