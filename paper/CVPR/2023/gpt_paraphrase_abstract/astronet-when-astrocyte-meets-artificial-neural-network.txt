This paper introduces a novel approach to network structure learning called AstroNet. The authors explore the use of astrocytes, a mechanism for regulating connections in the M-P neuron, to optimize neuron connections and improve the efficiency and accuracy of neural networks. AstroNet is built upon a model that combines astrocytes and neurons, incorporating a temporal regulation mechanism and a global connection mechanism inspired by bidirectional communication in astrocytes. The proposed AstroNet utilizes a neural network for tasks and an astrocyte network to continuously optimize the connections by assigning weights to neuron units adaptively. Experimental results on a classification task demonstrate that AstroNet efficiently optimizes network structure while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.
