Recent studies in multi-label zero-shot learning (MLZSL) have focused on visual-semantic mapping, which can be computationally expensive and fails to capture detailed class-specific semantics. However, we have noticed that different channels in the data often have varying sensitivities to different classes, suggesting a potential alternative approach for more accurate and class-consistent feature representations. In this paper, we aim to fully explore the potential of channel-class correlation as the foundation for MLZSL.To achieve this, we propose a lightweight yet efficient encoder called (ML)2P-Encoder, which is based on a Multi-Label Multi-Layer Perceptron. This encoder is designed to extract and preserve channel-wise semantics. We then reorganize the generated feature maps into multiple groups, allowing each group to be trained independently using the (ML)2P-Encoder. Additionally, we introduce a global group-wise attention module to establish multi-label specific class relationships across different classes. This framework, called Channel-Class Correlation MLZSL (C3-MLZSL), combines these components to create a novel approach to MLZSL.Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale MLZSL benchmarks, including NUS-WIDE and Open-Images-V4, demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to other state-of-the-art models. Our approach successfully captures fine-grained class-specific semantics and achieves more accurate and class-consistent feature representations.
