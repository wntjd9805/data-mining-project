We have developed a point cloud rendering pipeline for creating new views, which offers accurate local detail reconstruction, real-time rendering, and user-friendly editing. Our pipeline incorporates an adaptive frequency modulation module called Adaptive Frequency Net (AFNet), which employs a hypernetwork to learn how to encode local texture frequencies. This encoding is then used to modulate the implicit radiance signal, resulting in improved frequency expressive ability without significant computational overhead. Additionally, we propose a preprocessing module to optimize point cloud geometry by estimating point opacity. Unlike implicit rendering, our pipeline allows for high-fidelity interactive editing through point cloud manipulation. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/yizhangphd/FreqPCR.
