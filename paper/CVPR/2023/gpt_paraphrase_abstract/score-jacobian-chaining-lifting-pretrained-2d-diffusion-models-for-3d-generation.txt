We introduce a novel approach that utilizes a diffusion model to predict gradients in a vector field. By applying the chain rule to these learned gradients, we can back-propagate the diffusion model's score through a differentiable renderer's Jacobian, specifically a voxel radiance field. This enables us to aggregate 2D scores from multiple camera viewpoints into a 3D score, allowing us to repurpose a pretrained 2D model for generating 3D data. However, we encounter a challenge of distribution mismatch in this application. To address this, we propose a new estimation mechanism. We evaluate our algorithm on various diffusion image generative models, including the recently released Stable Diffusion trained on the large-scale LAION 5B dataset.
