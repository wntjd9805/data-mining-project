Existing multi-view clustering methods assume that samples across multiple views are intact. However, in real-world scenarios, data corruption or sensor failure often result in partially available multi-view samples, leading to incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Previous attempts to address IMVC have drawbacks: 1) Existing methods focus on cross-view contrastive learning, which forces the representations of each sample across views to be identical, disregarding view discrepancies and representation flexibility. 2) The absence of non-observed samples across multiple views leads to unaligned and biased cluster prototypes, causing incorrect fusion. To overcome these issues, we propose a Cross-view Partial Sample and Prototype Alignment Network (CPSPAN) for Deep Incomplete Multi-view Clustering. We introduce pair-observed data alignment as "proxy supervised signals" to guide the construction of instance-to-instance correspondence between views, instead of relying solely on contrastive-based methods. Additionally, we propose a prototype alignment module to calibrate incomplete distributions across views, addressing the problem of shifted prototypes in IMVC. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules, as they outperform existing IMVC competitors on benchmark datasets.
