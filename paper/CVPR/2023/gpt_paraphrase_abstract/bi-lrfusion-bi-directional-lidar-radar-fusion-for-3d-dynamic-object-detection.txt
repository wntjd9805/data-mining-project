LiDAR and Radar are two types of sensing approaches that have complementary strengths. While LiDAR is effective at capturing the 3D shape of objects, Radar can detect objects at longer ranges and provide information about their velocity. However, combining these two sensing approaches in a way that efficiently improves feature representation is still not well understood. The main challenge is that Radar data is sparse and lacks information about the height of objects. Therefore, directly integrating Radar features into LiDAR-centric detection networks is not the most optimal solution.To address these challenges and improve the detection of dynamic objects in 3D, we propose a bi-directional LiDAR-Radar fusion framework called Bi-LRFusion. This framework involves two steps: first, it enhances Radar's local features by learning important details from the LiDAR branch to overcome the absence of height information and extreme sparsity. Second, it combines the enhanced Radar features with LiDAR features in a unified bird's-eye-view representation.We conducted extensive experiments on the nuScenes and ORR datasets and demonstrated that our Bi-LRFusion framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting dynamic objects. It is worth noting that the Radar data in these datasets have different formats, which highlights the generalizability of our method. The code for our framework is available at the provided GitHub link.Figure 1 illustrates the difference between a uni-directional LiDAR-Radar fusion mechanism and our proposed bi-directional fusion mechanism. It also shows the average precision gain of the uni-directional fusion method RadarNet* compared to the LiDAR-centric baseline CenterPoint, categorized by different average heights of objects. It is important to note that the improvement gained by involving Radar data is not consistent for objects with different heights, with taller objects like trucks, buses, and trailers experiencing less performance gain. All height values are transformed to the LiDAR coordinate system.
