Self-supervised learning (SSL) has the potential to be advantageous in various applications, particularly in cases where manual data annotation is burdensome. This is especially true in the context of semantic segmentation of point clouds. Current methods in this field utilize contrastive learning strategies, generating positive pairs through augmentation of point clusters within a single frame. However, these methods fail to exploit the temporal nature of LiDAR data. In this study, we propose a novel SSL strategy that combines positive pairs in both the spatial and temporal domains. Our approach includes a point-to-cluster learning strategy that incorporates spatial information to distinguish objects, as well as a cluster-to-cluster learning strategy that utilizes unsupervised object tracking to exploit temporal correspondences. Through extensive experiments conducted on two large-scale LiDAR datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach. Additionally, we evaluate the transferability of our models to other point cloud segmentation benchmarks. Our results indicate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art SSL methods for point clouds.
