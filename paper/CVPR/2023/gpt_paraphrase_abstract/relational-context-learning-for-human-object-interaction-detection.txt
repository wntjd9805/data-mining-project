Current advanced methods for detecting human-object interactions (HOI) typically rely on transformer architectures with two separate decoder branches. One branch detects human-object pairs, while the other branch focuses on interaction classification. However, these disentangled transformers may suffer from a lack of effective context exchange between the branches, which hinders relational reasoning necessary for accurately identifying HOI instances. To address this issue, we introduce the multiplex relation network (MUREN). MUREN facilitates rich context exchange by incorporating unary, pairwise, and ternary relations among human, object, and interaction tokens within three decoder branches. This approach enables the learning of comprehensive relational contexts, resulting in superior performance on two widely used benchmarks for HOI detection, namely HICO-DET and V-COCO.
