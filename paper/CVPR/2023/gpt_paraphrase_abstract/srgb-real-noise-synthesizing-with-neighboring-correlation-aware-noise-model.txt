Modeling and synthesizing realistic noise in the sRGB domain is a difficult task due to the complex distribution of noise. Existing deep noise generators that synthesize sRGB noise lack explicit noise modeling, leading to lower quality synthesized noise. In this study, we propose a new approach that models real noise based not only on the pixel intensity of the underlying clean image but also on the correlated neighboring noise within the local region. Our framework explicitly learns the correlation between neighboring pixels in addition to the signal dependency, effectively bridging the distribution gap between synthetic and real noise. We demonstrate that our generated "real" sRGB noisy images can be used to train supervised deep denoisers, significantly improving their denoising performance compared to traditional denoisers or deep denoisers trained on other sRGB noise generators. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/xuan611/sRGB-Real-Noise-Synthesizing.
