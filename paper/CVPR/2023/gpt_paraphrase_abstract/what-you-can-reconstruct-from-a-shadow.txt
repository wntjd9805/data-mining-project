3D reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, especially when the object is partially or fully occluded. To address this, we propose a method that utilizes the shadows cast by the unobserved object to infer potential 3D volumes under occlusion. Our approach involves the development of a differentiable image formation model, which enables us to simultaneously estimate the object's 3D shape, pose, and the position of a light source. By leveraging end-to-end differentiability, we are able to incorporate learned priors of object geometry, allowing us to generate realistic 3D shapes across various object categories. Through experiments and visualizations, we demonstrate that our method can generate multiple plausible solutions that align with the observed shadow. Remarkably, our approach remains effective even when the position of the light source and object pose are unknown. Furthermore, our method exhibits robustness when dealing with real-world images where the ground-truth shadow mask is unavailable.
