Current 3D instance segmentation methods primarily rely on a bottom-up approach, where algorithms manually group points into clusters and then refine them using a network. However, these methods are prone to producing inaccurate results when faced with (1) the presence of nearby objects of the same semantic class that are packed together, or (2) large objects with loosely connected regions. To overcome these limitations, we present ISBNet, a novel cluster-free method that represents instances as kernels and decodes instance masks using dynamic convolution. To generate effective and distinct kernels efficiently, we propose a simple strategy called Instance-aware Farthest Point Sampling, which samples candidates and utilizes a local aggregation layer inspired by PointNet++. Additionally, we demonstrate that predicting and utilizing 3D axis-aligned bounding boxes in the dynamic convolution further enhances performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of AP on ScanNetV2 (55.9), S3DIS (60.8), and STPLS3D (49.2), while maintaining fast inference time (237ms per scene on ScanNetV2).
