The recent development of vision-language pre-trained models has greatly advanced open vocabulary object detection, allowing for the recognition of novel objects based solely on semantic categories. Previous research has focused on transferring knowledge to object proposal classification using class-agnostic box and mask prediction. In this study, we propose CondHead, a dynamic network design that improves the generalization of box regression and mask segmentation in an open vocabulary setting. The main idea is to conditionally parameterize the network heads based on semantic embeddings, enabling the model to be guided by class-specific knowledge for better detection of novel categories. CondHead consists of two streams of network heads: the dynamically aggregated head, which combines a set of static heads optimized as experts, and the dynamically generated head, which incorporates dynamically generated parameters and encodes general class-specific information. This conditional design connects the detection model with semantic embeddings, resulting in highly generalizable class-wise box and mask predictions. Our method significantly improves upon state-of-the-art open vocabulary object detection methods with minimal overhead, surpassing a RegionClip model by 3.0 detectionAP on novel categories while requiring only 1.1% additional computation.
