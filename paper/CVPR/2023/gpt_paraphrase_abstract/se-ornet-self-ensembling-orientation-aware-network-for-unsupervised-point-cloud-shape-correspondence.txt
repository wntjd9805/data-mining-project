This study focuses on the challenge of unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence, which aims to establish point-to-point correspondences between point clouds without manual annotation. However, existing methods often struggle with mispredictions of symmetrical parts due to the bilateral symmetry and various orientations present in humans and animals. Additionally, point cloud noise disrupts the accuracy of shape correspondence. To address these issues, the authors propose a novel approach called SE-ORNet (Self-Ensembling ORientation-aware Network). The key component of this approach is an orientation estimation module combined with a domain adaptive discriminator, which helps align the orientations of point cloud pairs and reduces mispredictions. Moreover, the authors introduce a self-ensembling framework to overcome the disturbances caused by point cloud noise. This framework perturbs the inputs of the student and teacher networks using different data augmentations and ensures consistency in predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on human and animal datasets demonstrate that SE-ORNet outperforms existing unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence methods, establishing it as a state-of-the-art approach.
