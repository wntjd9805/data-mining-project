Fashion vision-language pre-training models have been effective in various downstream tasks. However, these models often overlook fine-grained domain features that are crucial for distinguishing specific domain tasks from general tasks. To address this, we propose a method called Fashion Symbols and Attributes Prompt (FashionSAP) for fine-grained fashion vision-language pre-training. Our approach introduces fashion symbols, a novel abstract fashion concept layer, to represent different fashion items and capture diverse fine-grained fashion features, enhancing the modeling of fine-grained attributes. Additionally, we propose the attributes prompt method, which allows the model to explicitly learn specific attributes of fashion items. We design appropriate prompt templates based on the fashion data format.We conduct comprehensive experiments on two public fashion benchmarks, namely FashionGen and FashionIQ. The results demonstrate that FashionSAP achieves state-of-the-art performance in four popular fashion tasks. Ablation studies further confirm that the proposed abstract fashion symbols and attribute prompt method effectively enable the model to acquire fine-grained semantics in the fashion domain.The significant performance improvements achieved by FashionSAP set a new baseline for future fashion task research.
