Classifying incomplete multi-view data is a challenge in real-world applications due to the presence of missing views. Existing methods struggle to provide reliable predictions because of the high uncertainty associated with missing views. To address this, we propose the Uncertainty-induced Incomplete Multi-View Data Classification (UIMC) model. Our approach incorporates the uncertainty of missing views by constructing a distribution and sampling multiple times. We then adaptively utilize these samples to improve imputation and fusion. Each missing data is modeled as a distribution conditioned on available views, introducing uncertainty. An evidence-based fusion strategy is employed to ensure reliable integration of imputed views. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and trustworthiness.
