Spatial context is crucial in digital pathology for tasks such as cell classification, cancer diagnosis, and prognosis. However, modeling the complex cell context poses challenges due to the various formations of cells, including mixtures, lineages, clusters, and holes. To address this, we propose the use of mathematical tools from spatial statistics and topological data analysis to capture these structural patterns. We incorporate these structural descriptors into a deep generative model, allowing us to generate high-quality multi-class cell layouts for the first time. By utilizing topology-rich cell layouts, we demonstrate that they can enhance data augmentation and improve the performance of downstream tasks like cell classification.
