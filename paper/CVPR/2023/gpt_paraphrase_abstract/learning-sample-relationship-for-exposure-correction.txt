The goal of the exposure correction task is to adjust underexposed and overexposed images to normal exposure using a single network. However, existing methods have not explored the relationship between underexposure and overexposure to solve the optimization inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines the optimization processes of underexposed and overexposed images by correlating and constraining their correction procedures in a mini-batch. Our framework consists of two steps: 1) establishing the exposure relationship of samples across the batch dimension through a context-irrelevant pretext task, and 2) incorporating this sample relationship design as a regularization term in the loss function to ensure optimization consistency. This sample relationship design can be easily integrated into existing exposure correction methods without adding computational burden during inference. Experimental results on various exposure correction benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements with the introduction of our sample relationship design.
