The popularity of 360◦ images has grown with the advancements in virtual reality technology. However, the high resolution required for these images poses challenges in terms of acquisition, storage, and processing. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called 360◦ image rescaling. This involves downsizing a 360◦ image to a visually valid low-resolution version and then upscaling it to a high-resolution 360◦ image using the low-resolution variant. Through our analysis of two 360◦ image datasets, we identify specific characteristics of how these images change along their latitudes. Based on these findings, we introduce a deformable invertible neural network (INN) called DINN360 for latitude-aware 360◦ image rescaling. DINN360 utilizes a deformable INN to downscale the low-resolution image and handle various deformations occurring at different latitude regions. The high-quality high-resolution image is then reconstructed in a conditional latitude-aware manner by recovering the structure-related high-frequency component. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate that our DINN360 method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for 2×, 4×, and 8× 360◦ image rescaling.
