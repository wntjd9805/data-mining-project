Developing effective face recognition (FR) attacks is challenging due to the limited access to information about the target FR model. Previous research has made progress in attacking black-box FR models using transferability, but their performance remains limited, especially against online commercial FR systems. To address this, we propose Sibling-Attack, a new FR attack technique that leverages extra information from multi-correlated tasks to enhance attacking transferability. Sibling-Attack selects a set of tasks correlated with FR and chooses the Attribute Recognition (AR) task for the attack based on theoretical and quantitative analysis. It then develops an optimization framework that combines adversarial gradient information through constraining cross-task features, a joint-task meta optimization framework, and a cross-task gradient stabilization method. Extensive experiments show that Sibling-Attack outperforms existing FR attack techniques, increasing the attack success rate by 12.61% and 55.77% on average for state-of-the-art pre-trained FR models and two widely used commercial FR systems.
