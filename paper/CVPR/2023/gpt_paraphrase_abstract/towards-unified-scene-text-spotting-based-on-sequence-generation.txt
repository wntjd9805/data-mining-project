Recently, there has been significant progress in unifying different vision tasks using sequence generation models. However, existing auto-regressive models for text spotting have limitations in terms of detection formats and the maximum number of text instances that can be detected. To address these limitations, we propose UNITS, a UNIfied scene Text Spotter. Our model can detect text in various shapes, including quadrilaterals and polygons, unlike previous models that only focus on specific formats. Additionally, we introduce starting-point prompting, which allows the model to extract texts from any arbitrary starting point, enabling it to detect more texts beyond the number of instances it was trained on. Our experimental results demonstrate that UNITS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our analysis shows that UNITS can extract a larger number of texts than its training instances. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/clovaai/units.
