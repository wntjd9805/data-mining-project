We propose a two-step approach, OG-INR, for reconstructing surfaces from unoriented point clouds. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have gained popularity for this task, but without information about shape occupancy, signed distances, or surface normal orientation, optimization becomes reliant on heuristics and regularizers, leading to slow convergence and getting trapped in local minima. In our approach, we first construct a discrete octree and label the inside and outside of the shape. Then, we optimize for a continuous and high-fidelity shape using an INR that is initially guided by the octree's labeling. To solve for the labeling, we introduce an energy function and an efficient move-making algorithm that explores multiple possible labelings. Additionally, we demonstrate that we can easily incorporate prior knowledge into the discrete octree to influence the result from the continuous INR. We evaluate our approach on two unoriented surface reconstruction datasets and show competitive performance compared to other unoriented and some oriented methods. Our results indicate that the move-making algorithm's exploration helps avoid the undesirable local minima encountered by gradient descent-based methods.
