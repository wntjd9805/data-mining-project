The detection of prohibited items in X-ray images is crucial for transportation security. However, there is a lack of sufficient data for training detection models. To address this issue, we propose a Region-Wise Style-Controlled Fusion (RWSC-Fusion) network that synthesizes prohibited X-ray security images by overlaying prohibited items onto normal X-ray security images. The RWSC-Fusion module enables region-wise fusion by controlling the appearance of the overlapping region using modulation parameters. Additionally, an Edge-Attention (EA) module is introduced to enhance the sharpness of the synthetic images. We also propose two unsupervised loss functions, namely Luminance loss in Logarithmic form (LL) and Correlation loss of Saturation Difference (CSD), to optimize the fused X-ray security images based on luminance and saturation. We evaluate the authenticity and training effectiveness of the synthetic X-ray security images on private and public SIXray datasets. The results confirm that our synthetic images are reliable for augmenting prohibited X-ray security images.
