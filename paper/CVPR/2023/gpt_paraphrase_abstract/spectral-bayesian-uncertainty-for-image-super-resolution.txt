Recent advancements in deep learning techniques have greatly improved the quality of image super-resolution (SR). However, the opaque nature of deep SR networks makes it important to accurately quantify reconstruction uncertainty. Existing methods for SR uncertainty estimation primarily focus on measuring uncertainty at the pixel level in the spatial domain, while neglecting the exploration of uncertainty in the frequency domain, which is closely related to image SR. In this study, we propose a method to quantify spectral Bayesian uncertainty in image SR. To achieve this, we introduce a Dual-Domain Learning (DDL) framework that, when combined with Bayesian approaches, accurately estimates spectral uncertainty. This enables a reliable assessment of high frequency reasoning from a frequency domain perspective. We conduct extensive experiments under non-ideal conditions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral uncertainty. Additionally, we propose a new training scheme called Spectral Uncertainty based Decoupled Frequency (SUDF) for perceptual SR. Experimental results show that SUDF significantly improves the perceptual quality of SR results without sacrificing pixel accuracy.
