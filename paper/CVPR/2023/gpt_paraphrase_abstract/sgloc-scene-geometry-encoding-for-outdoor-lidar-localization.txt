LiDAR-based absolute pose regression has shown impressive results in learning-based localization. However, existing methods still have room for improvement in terms of accuracy. This is primarily due to the challenges of effectively encoding scene geometry and the unsatisfactory quality of the data. To address these issues, we propose a novel LiDAR localization framework called SGLoc.SGLoc decouples the pose estimation process into two steps: point cloud correspondence regression and pose estimation based on this correspondence. This decoupling significantly improves the encoding of scene geometry, as the correspondence regression step effectively preserves the scene geometry. Additionally, we introduce a tri-scale spatial feature aggregation module and an inter-geometric consistency constraint loss to capture scene geometry more effectively.We also identify the presence of noisy ground truth data, which is caused by GPS/INS measuring errors. This significantly reduces the accuracy of pose estimation. To overcome this challenge, we propose a pose quality evaluation and enhancement method to measure and correct the ground truth pose.To validate the effectiveness of SGLoc, we conduct extensive experiments on the Oxford Radar RobotCar and NCLT datasets. The results demonstrate that SGLoc outperforms state-of-the-art regression-based localization methods by 68.5% and 67.6% in terms of position accuracy on these datasets, respectively.
