Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) is a method that involves classifying new target data using a combination of labeled and unlabeled target data, along with labeled source data from a related domain. Current SSDA approaches focus on aligning the target data with the labeled source data, but this can sometimes lead to misalignment and degrade classification performance. This paper presents a new approach called source-adaptive paradigm, which adapts the source data to match the target data. The idea is to consider the source data as a noisily-labeled version of the ideal target data and use a robust cleaner component to dynamically remove label noise from the source data. This approach can be easily integrated with existing SSDA methods to improve their performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model effectively removes noise from the source labels and outperforms other approaches.
