This paper investigates the reasons for the success of recent vision transformers and large kernel design in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of 3D large-scale scene understanding. The authors identify two critical factors: a larger receptive field and greater non-linearity. A larger receptive field allows for long-range contexts, while increased non-linearity enhances network capacity. To address these factors, the authors propose a simple and effective long-range pooling (LRP) module using dilation max pooling. This module, which has few parameters, can be easily incorporated into existing CNNs. Building on the LRP module, the authors present a network architecture called LRPNet for 3D understanding. Ablation studies support the claims made, demonstrating that the LRP module achieves better results than large kernel convolution with reduced computation due to its non-linearity. The authors also showcase the superiority of LRPNet on various benchmarks, outperforming other CNN-based methods on ScanNet, S3DIS, and Matterport3D. The code for LRPNet is available at https://github.com/li-xl/LRPNet.
