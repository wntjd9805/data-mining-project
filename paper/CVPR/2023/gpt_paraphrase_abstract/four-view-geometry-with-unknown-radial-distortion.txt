We propose innovative solutions to address the previously unsolved challenges of estimating the relative pose from images when the camera's calibration parameters, such as focal lengths and radial distortion, are unknown. Our method allows for metric reconstruction without the need to model these parameters. The minimum requirement for reconstruction is 13 points in 4 views, regardless of whether the camera is calibrated or uncalibrated. We introduce the first solution to these minimal problems and demonstrate its implementation.In the case of a calibrated camera, the problem can be represented as a polynomial system of equations with 3584 solutions. Despite the initial complexity, we discover that the problem can be decomposed effectively. Each solution belongs to a Euclidean symmetry class of size 16, and by solving a series of three subproblems, we can estimate 224 class representatives. These subproblems have 28, 2, and 4 solutions respectively.We highlight the connection between the internal constraints imposed on the radial quadrifocal tensor and the relationships among the principal minors of a 4x4 matrix. Additionally, we address the scenario of using 4 upright cameras, where a minimum of 7 points is required.To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we test it on both simulated and real data. We compare our results against previous calibration-free solutions and demonstrate that our method serves as an efficient starting point for a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline with radial cameras.This research is supported by the EU RDF IMPACT No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15 003/0000468 and EU H2020 No. 871245 SPRING projects.

In this setup, a radial camera projects a 3D point onto a radial line passing through its pinhole projection.
