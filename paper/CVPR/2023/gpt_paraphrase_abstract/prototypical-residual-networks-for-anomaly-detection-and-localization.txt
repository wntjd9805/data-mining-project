Anomaly detection and localization are commonly used in industrial manufacturing due to their efficiency and effectiveness. However, collecting anomalies for training supervised models is challenging and often leads to overfitting, resulting in poor performance. Additionally, anomalies are often subtle and difficult to identify, making it challenging to detect and locate them accurately. To address these issues, we propose a framework called Prototypical Residual Network (PRN) that learns feature residuals of varying scales and sizes between anomalous and normal patterns. This allows for accurate reconstruction of segmentation maps for anomalous regions. PRN consists of two main components: multi-scale prototypes that represent the residual features of anomalies compared to normal patterns, and a multi-size self-attention mechanism that facilitates variable-sized anomalous feature learning. We also introduce various anomaly generation strategies that consider both seen and unseen appearance variations to enhance and diversify anomalies. Our extensive experiments on the widely used MVTec AD benchmark demonstrate that PRN outperforms current state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised methods. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three additional datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of PRN.
