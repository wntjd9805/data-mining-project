This paper presents a novel convolution structure for learning SE(3)-equivariant features from 3D point clouds. The proposed structure is an equivariant version of kernel point convolutions (KPConv), a popular convolution technique for point cloud data processing. In comparison to existing equivariant networks, our design is straightforward, lightweight, efficient, and easily integrated into existing point cloud learning pipelines. We achieve these advantages by combining group convolutions and quotient representations. Specifically, we discretize the rotation group SO(3) into finite groups for simplicity, while using the stabilizer subgroup SO(2) to create spherical quotient feature fields, reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we introduce a permutation layer to recover SO(3) features from spherical features, preserving the ability to distinguish rotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance in various tasks such as object classification, pose estimation, and keypoint matching, while requiring less memory and running faster than existing approaches. The proposed method has the potential to advance the development of equivariant models for real-world applications based on point clouds.
