This paper presents a novel meta-learning approach for compressive sampling (CS) that does not rely on ground-truth data. The proposed method combines external and internal deep learning techniques for unsupervised image reconstruction. Initially, a deep neural network (NN) is trained using only CS measurements through external meta-learning. Then, the trained model is adapted to a specific test sample, taking advantage of the sample-specific internal characteristics for improved performance. The meta-learning and model adaptation rely on an improved version of Stein's unbiased risk estimator (iSURE), which enables efficient computation and accurate prediction within the range space of the adjoint of the measurement matrix. To enhance learning and adaptation in the null space of the measurement matrix, a modified model-agnostic meta-learning scheme and a null-space consistency loss are introduced. Additionally, a bias tuning scheme is proposed to accelerate the model adaptation process by unrolling NNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GT-free method performs well and can even compete with supervised methods.
