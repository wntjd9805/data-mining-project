The aim of Low-light Image Enhancement (LIE) is to improve contrast and restore details for images taken in low-light conditions. Previous algorithms for LIE adjusted illumination using a single input image and handcrafted priors. However, these solutions often failed to reveal image details due to the limited information in a single image and the poor adaptability of handcrafted priors. In this study, we propose PairLIE, an unsupervised approach that learns adaptive priors from pairs of low-light images. Our approach uses the Retinex theory to generate clean images by ensuring the consistency of the reflectance components in the two input images. Additionally, we propose a self-supervised mechanism to remove inappropriate features in the raw image and assist in the Retinex decomposition. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that PairLIE achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches with a simpler network and fewer handcrafted priors.
