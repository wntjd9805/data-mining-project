Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling relational data, but they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a risk to their use in sensitive domains. Current defensive methods do not provide guarantees against new data/tasks or adversarial attacks, nor do they offer insights into GNN robustness from an architectural perspective. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has the potential to address this issue by automating GNN architecture design. However, existing graph NAS approaches lack robustness and are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework called G-RNA (Robust Neural Architecture search) for GNNs. G-RNA introduces a robust search space for the message-passing mechanism by incorporating graph structure mask operations. These operations include various defensive candidates and enable the search for robust GNNs. Additionally, we define a robustness metric to guide the search process and filter out robust architectures. G-RNA not only helps understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective but also effectively discovers optimal adversarial robust GNNs. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that G-RNA outperforms manually designed robust GNNs and vanilla graph NAS baselines by 12.1% to 23.4% under adversarial attacks.
