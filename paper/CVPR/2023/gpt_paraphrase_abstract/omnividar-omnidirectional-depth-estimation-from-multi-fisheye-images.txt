We present a new system called OmniVidar that addresses the challenging problem of estimating depth from four large field of view (FoV) cameras. Our system converts this difficult problem into a simpler binocular depth estimation task. OmniVidar consists of three components: (1) a novel camera model that overcomes the limitations of existing models, (2) a new method for epipolar rectification based on a multi-fisheye camera, which solves image distortion and simplifies depth estimation, and (3) an improved binocular depth estimation network that achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Unlike other omnidirectional stereo vision methods, OmniVidar does not use 3D convolution, enabling it to achieve high-resolution depth estimation at a faster speed. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVidar outperforms other methods in terms of both accuracy and performance.
