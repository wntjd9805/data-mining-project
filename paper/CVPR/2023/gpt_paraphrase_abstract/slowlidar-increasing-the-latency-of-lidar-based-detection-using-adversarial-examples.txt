The safety of LiDAR-based perception in autonomous driving is crucial, and previous studies have examined its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. However, most of these studies have focused on the impact of perturbations on predictions rather than latency, which is important for real-time cyber-physical systems. This study presents the first investigation into the availability of LiDAR detection pipelines and introduces SlowLiDAR, an adversarial attack that maximizes the runtime of LiDAR detection. SlowLiDAR overcomes technical challenges by using differentiable proxies and employs a novel loss function to measure the impact of perturbations on pipeline execution time. The experimental results demonstrate that SlowLiDAR can significantly increase latency in popular LiDAR detection pipelines while maintaining imperceptibility.
