This paper addresses the challenge of predicting future trajectories in autonomous driving, which is a complex task. One issue with trajectory prediction is the imbalance of data in prevalent datasets, where the tail data is more complicated and safety-critical. Previous methods for dealing with long-tail data did not consider the variety of motion patterns within the tail data. To address this, the authors propose a future enhanced contrastive learning framework that can recognize tail trajectory patterns and create a feature space with separate pattern clusters. Additionally, they introduce a distribution aware hyper predictor to better utilize the shaped feature space. The proposed method is a model-agnostic framework that can be integrated into existing baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework outperforms the state-of-the-art long-tail prediction method on tail samples, achieving a 9.5% improvement in ADE and 8.5% improvement in FDE, while maintaining or slightly improving the overall performance. The method also surpasses many other long-tail techniques in trajectory prediction tasks.
