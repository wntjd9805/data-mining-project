The hardware image signal processing (ISP) pipeline is an intermediary layer that transforms the sensor signal into an RGB image. It consists of multiple processing modules, each with tunable hyperparameters. Currently, manual hyperparameter tuning by experts is the norm, but there are emerging methods that automate this process using evaluation metrics. However, these methods treat the parameter space as a whole without considering the structure of the ISP. To address this, we propose a sequential ISP hyperparameter prediction framework that leverages the sequential relationship between modules and the similarity among parameters. We tested our method on object detection, image segmentation, and image quality tasks.
