Generalized few-shot object detection aims to achieve accurate detection for both base classes, which have abundant annotations, and novel classes, which have limited training data. Existing approaches either sacrifice the performance on base classes to enhance few-shot generalization or maintain high precision on base classes with limited improvement in novel class adaptation. This paper identifies insufficient discriminative feature learning as the reason behind this issue. To address this, a new training framework called DiGeo is proposed, which focuses on learning geometry-aware features for inter-class separation and intra-class compactness. To guide the separation of feature clusters, an offline simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classifier is derived, where the weights represent class centers that are maximally and equally separated. To further tighten the cluster for each class, adaptive class-specific margins are included in the classification loss, encouraging the features to be closer to the class centers. Experimental studies conducted on two few-shot benchmark datasets (VOC, COCO) and one long-tail dataset (LVIS) demonstrate that our method effectively improves generalization on novel classes without compromising the detection performance on base classes.
