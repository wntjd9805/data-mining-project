This abstract discusses the limitations of current human motion prediction techniques and proposes a new network called DeFeeNet to address these limitations. Current techniques simplify the prediction task into a one-off process, neglecting the fact that motion prediction is a consecutive process with overlapping rounds. DeFeeNet is designed to encode and incorporate the deviation generated by previous rounds into the existing predictor, enabling a deviation-aware prediction manner. The network is evaluated on Human3.6M and BABEL datasets, showing improved consecutive human motion prediction performance regardless of the basic model used.
