This paper introduces a novel approach called Hierarchical Geometry Network (HGNet) for analyzing and representing point clouds. The goal is to parse unstructured point sets into local geometry structures such as edges, surfaces, and super-surfaces. The proposed architecture models the hierarchical geometry in a top-down manner, starting from super-surfaces and progressing to surfaces, edges, and finally points. To achieve this, the network first constructs edges between neighboring points and learns a point-level representation by aggregating the connected edges. Then, the edge-level representation is obtained by aggregating neighbor surfaces. The surface-level representation is achieved by transforming super-surfaces into the anchor surface. Finally, a Transformer structure is used to combine all the point-level, edge-level, and surface-level features into holistic point cloud representations.Extensive experiments conducted on four point cloud analysis datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGNet for tasks such as 3D object classification and part/semantic segmentation. Notably, HGNet achieves an overall accuracy of 89.2% on the ScanObjectNN dataset, outperforming the PointNeXt-S approach by 1.5%.
