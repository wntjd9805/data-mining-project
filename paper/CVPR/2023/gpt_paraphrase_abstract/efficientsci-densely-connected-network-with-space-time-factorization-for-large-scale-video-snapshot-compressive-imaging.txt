Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures consecutive video frames with a single exposure time. However, existing deep learning-based reconstruction algorithms for SCI face challenges due to high computational cost and inability to reconstruct large-scale video frames at high compression ratios. To overcome these challenges, we propose EfficientSCI, an efficient network for video SCI that utilizes dense connections and a space-time factorization mechanism within a single residual block. EfficientSCI establishes spatial-temporal correlation using convolution in the spatial domain and Transformer in the temporal domain. We demonstrate that our approach can reconstruct a high compression ratio UHD color video from a snapshot 2D measurement using a single end-to-end deep learning model with a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 32 dB. Extensive simulation and real data experiments show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms and achieves better real-time performance.
