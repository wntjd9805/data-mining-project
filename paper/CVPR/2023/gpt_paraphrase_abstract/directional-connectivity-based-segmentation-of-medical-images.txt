Ensuring anatomical consistency in biomarker segmentation is crucial for medical image analysis. One approach to achieving this consistency is by incorporating pixel connectivity, a concept from digital topology, into deep networks. However, previous research on connectivity modeling has overlooked the valuable channel-wise directional information in the latent space. In this study, we demonstrate that effectively disentangling the directional sub-space from the shared latent space can significantly improve feature representation in connectivity-based networks. To accomplish this, we propose a directional connectivity modeling scheme that separates, tracks, and utilizes directional information throughout the network. We conducted experiments on various public medical image segmentation benchmarks and found that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/Zyun-Y/DconnNet.
