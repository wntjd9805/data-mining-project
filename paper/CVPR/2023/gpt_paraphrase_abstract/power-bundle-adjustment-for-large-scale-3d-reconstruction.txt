We present Power Bundle Adjustment, an algorithm for solving large-scale bundle adjustment problems. This method, known as an inverse expansion method, utilizes the power series expansion of the inverse Schur complement. We provide theoretical justification for the use of power series and prove the convergence of our approach. By applying this solver to the BAL dataset, we show that it outperforms existing iterative methods and greatly speeds up the solution of the normal equation, even at high levels of accuracy. Additionally, the Power Bundle Adjustment can be easily implemented and complements a distributed bundle adjustment framework. We demonstrate that utilizing this solver as a sub-problem solver significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of the distributed optimization process.
