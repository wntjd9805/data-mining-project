Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression (DAR) is a technique used to address the domain gap between labeled source data and unlabeled target data in regression problems. Previous studies have focused on learning a deep feature encoder to minimize the differences between the features of the source and target datasets. However, this work takes a different approach by analyzing the closed-form ordinary least square (OLS) solution to the linear regressor in the context of deep domain adaptation. Instead of aligning the original feature embedding space, the proposal suggests aligning the inverse Gram matrix of the features. This is motivated by the presence of the inverse Gram matrix in the OLS solution and its ability to capture feature correlations. The proposed DAR method uses the pseudo-inverse low-rank property to align the scale and angle in a selected subspace generated by the pseudo-inverse Gram matrix of the two domains. The method is simple yet effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three domain adaptation regression benchmarks.
