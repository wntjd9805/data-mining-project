The abstract discusses the importance of realistic occlusion in augmented reality (AR) and the challenges of achieving accurate depth ordering. The authors propose an alternative approach that eliminates the need for depth-regression and instead uses an implicit model for depth to directly predict the occlusion mask. They demonstrate that their method produces more accurate and temporally stable occlusion predictions compared to traditional depth-estimation models. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the ScanNetv2 dataset and superior qualitative results on real scenes.
