Cascaded computation has been a consistent feature in the development of landmark detection models. The Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ) can be effectively adapted to this type of computation. Our Landmark DEQ (LDEQ) achieves superior performance on the WFLW facial landmark dataset with fewer parameters and minimal training memory cost. We also demonstrate that DEQs are well-suited for landmark detection in videos, where training is typically done on still images. This can result in a flickering effect during inference, where the model rapidly oscillates between different plausible solutions in consecutive frames. By treating DEQs as a constrained optimization, we can simulate recurrence at inference time, even without access to temporal data during training. This approach, known as Recurrence without Recurrence (RwR), reduces landmark flicker and improves performance. We introduce a new metric called normalized mean flicker (NMF) and a new facial landmark video dataset (WFLW-V) to target landmark uncertainty. On the challenging WFLW-V hard subset, our LDEQ with RwR achieves a significant improvement in NME and NMF compared to previous models.
