Real-time object detection is a crucial area of study in computer vision. With the continuous development of new techniques for optimizing architecture and training, two research topics have emerged. In order to address these topics, we propose a solution that focuses on trainable bag-of-freebies. Our approach combines efficient training tools with a proposed architecture and the compound scaling method. The YOLOv7 model outperforms all existing object detectors in terms of both speed and accuracy, achieving a range of 5 to 120 frames per second (FPS). It also exhibits the highest accuracy, with an average precision (AP) of 56.8%, among all real-time object detectors running at 30 FPS or higher on the GPU V100.
