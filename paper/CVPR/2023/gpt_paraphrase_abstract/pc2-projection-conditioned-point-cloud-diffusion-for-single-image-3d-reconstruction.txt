This paper presents a new method for reconstructing the 3D shape of an object from a single RGB image. The method utilizes a conditional denoising diffusion process to generate a sparse point cloud. The process starts with randomly sampled 3D points from a Gaussian distribution and gradually denoises them to form the shape of the object. A key aspect of the method is the projection conditioning, where local image features are projected onto the partially-denoised point cloud based on the camera pose. This enables the generation of high-resolution sparse geometries that are well-aligned with the input image and can also predict point colors. The probabilistic nature of the diffusion process allows for the generation of multiple different shapes consistent with a single input image. The proposed approach outperforms previous methods on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world data. The data and code for the method are available at a specific website.
