Deep neural networks have achieved impressive results in 3D point cloud classification tasks. However, this success has also raised concerns about the vulnerability of these networks to adversarial attacks, which can have severe consequences in real-world applications. Defending against such attacks in point cloud data is particularly challenging due to the emergence of different attack strategies. In this study, we propose a novel defense framework to enhance the robustness of existing classification models against adversarial examples in point cloud data. Our approach is based on the insight that adversarial examples in this task still retain the same semantic and structural information as the original input. The framework consists of two main modules: attention-based pooling and dynamic contrastive learning. Additionally, we develop an algorithm to theoretically certify the robustness of our proposed framework. Our empirical results on two datasets and three classification models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against various attacks. For instance, the average attack success rate of PointNet on the ModelNet40 dataset decreases from 70.2% to 2.7% under nine common attacks.
