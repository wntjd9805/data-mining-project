Reconstructing 3D human motion is a valuable task with numerous applications. However, current gold standard methods like Motion capture (MoCap) are expensive and not accessible to the general public. On the other hand, monocular human mesh recovery (HMR) methods are more accessible as they only require single-view videos as inputs. By replacing multi-view MoCap systems with monocular HMR methods, we can overcome the barriers to collecting accurate 3D motion and make motion analysis and motion-driven animation available to the general public. However, existing HMR methods struggle with challenging and dynamic motion that is not present in the MoCap datasets used for training, which limits their effectiveness in applications where dynamic motion is the focus. To address this, our study introduces the Neural Motion (NeMo) field, which leverages information from multiple video instances of the same action to bridge the gap between monocular HMR and multi-view MoCap systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeMo in recovering 3D motion in sports using the Penn Action dataset, where it outperforms existing HMR methods in terms of 2D keypoint detection. Additionally, we validate NeMo using a small MoCap dataset that mimics actions in Penn Action and show that it achieves superior 3D reconstruction compared to various baselines.
