We propose UDPReg, an unsupervised deep probabilistic registration framework for point clouds with partial overlaps. Our method addresses the challenges faced by deep point cloud registration methods and eliminates the need for labeled data. To learn the posterior probability distributions of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) from point clouds, we utilize a network. For partial point cloud registration, we employ the Sinkhorn algorithm to predict distribution-level correspondences while considering the mixing weights of GMMs. To enable unsupervised learning, we introduce three distribution consistency-based losses: self-consistency, cross-consistency, and local contrastive. The self-consistency loss ensures that GMMs in both Euclidean and feature spaces share identical posterior distributions. The cross-consistency loss takes advantage of the fact that points belonging to the same clusters in partially overlapping point clouds share cluster centroids. This allows the network to learn a transformation-invariant posterior distribution for aligned point clouds. The local contrastive loss aids in extracting discriminative local features. Our UDPReg framework achieves competitive performance on the 3DMatch/3DLoMatch and Model-Net/ModelLoNet benchmarks.
