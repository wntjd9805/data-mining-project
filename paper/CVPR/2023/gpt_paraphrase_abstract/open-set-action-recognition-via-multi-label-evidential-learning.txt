We propose a new method called MUlti-Label Evidential learning (MULE) for open set action recognition and novelty detection. Unlike existing methods that assume videos only show a single action, our approach addresses the more realistic scenario of multiple actors in the same scene, with simultaneous actions by any actor. We use a Beta Evidential Neural Network to estimate multi-action uncertainty based on actor-context-object relation representations. To reduce static bias in video representations, we introduce an evidence debiasing constraint to the optimization objective function. We also develop a primal-dual average scheme update-based learning algorithm for optimization and provide theoretical analysis. Additionally, we formulate uncertainty and belief-based novelty estimation mechanisms to detect novel actions. Experimental results on real-world video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both single/multi-actor and single/multi-action settings. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/charliezhaoyinpeng/mule.
