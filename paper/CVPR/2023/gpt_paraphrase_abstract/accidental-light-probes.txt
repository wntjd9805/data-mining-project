Recovering lighting in computer vision is a crucial task, but it is often challenging due to the lack of available light probes. Light probes such as mirror ball light probes capture omnidirectional lighting but are not commonly found in everyday images. This study focuses on the recovery of lighting from accidental light probes (ALPs), which are shiny objects like Coke cans that can unintentionally appear in daily scenes. The researchers propose a physically-based approach to model ALPs and estimate lighting based on their appearances in single images. The key concept is to use photogrammetrically principled shading to model the appearance of ALPs and then reverse this process through differentiable rendering to recover incidental illumination. The researchers demonstrate that by introducing an ALP into a scene, they can accurately estimate high-fidelity lighting. Additionally, their model is capable of recovering lighting for pre-existing images that happen to contain an ALP.
