This paper presents a new coordination optimization framework for improving the stability, interpretability, and computational efficiency of HSI-SR methods. The proposed framework establishes a positive cycle between fusion and degradation estimation using a probabilistic approach. The estimated degradation is then used as guidance for degradation-aware HSI-SR. To address the indeterminacy and unstable performance issues caused by black-box simulation, an explicit degradation estimation method is introduced. Additionally, a spectral mixing prior is integrated into the fusion process to enhance interpretability, which is achieved using a small autoencoder. This integration significantly reduces the computational burden. Furthermore, a partial fine-tuning strategy is developed based on the spectral mixing prior to further reduce computation costs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods using both synthetic and real datasets. For example, on the CAVE dataset, our method achieves a 2.3 dB improvement in PSNR with a model size reduction of 120× and a reduction of 4300×FLOPs.
