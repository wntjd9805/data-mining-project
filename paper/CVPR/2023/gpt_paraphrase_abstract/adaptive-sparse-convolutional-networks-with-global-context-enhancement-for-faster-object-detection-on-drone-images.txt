This study focuses on the challenge of object detection on resource-constrained unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. The authors investigate the optimization of the detection head using sparse convolution to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. However, current methods lack the integration of contextual information for small objects and struggle with controlling the mask ratio for foreground objects of varying scales. To address these issues, the authors propose a novel approach called the global context-enhanced adaptive sparse convolutional network (CEASC). CEASC incorporates a context-enhanced group normalization layer that utilizes global contextual statistics instead of sparsely sampled features. Additionally, an adaptive multi-layer masking strategy is designed to generate optimal mask ratios for different scales of foreground objects, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, VisDrone and UAVDT, demonstrate that CEASC significantly reduces computational complexity and speeds up inference when integrated into state-of-the-art detection frameworks such as RetinaNet and GFL V1. The code for CEASC is publicly available at https://github.com/Cuogeihong/CEASC.
