Few-shot learning (FSL) is a popular approach for adapting to new classes. Transductive models, which utilize all samples in the query set, tend to outperform inductive models. However, existing methods in FSL suffer from inaccurate prototype estimation and sub-optimal graph construction using kernel functions. To address these issues, we propose a new prototype-based label propagation method. Our approach constructs a graph based on the relationship between prototypes and samples, rather than between samples alone. As the prototypes are updated, the graph evolves accordingly. Additionally, we estimate the label of each prototype instead of considering a prototype as the class center. Experimental results on mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and CUB datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in transductive FSL and semi-supervised FSL when accompanied by some unlabeled data in the few-shot task.
