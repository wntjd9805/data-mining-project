This study aims to address the challenges of generating meshes by proposing a novel sparse latent point diffusion model. Instead of directly generating meshes, the model focuses on modeling the distribution of point clouds, which serve as an intermediate representation of meshes. By encoding point clouds into a set of sparse latent points with semantic features, the efficiency and controllability of the mesh generation process are enhanced. Two Deep Density Propagation Models (DDPMs) are trained to model the distribution of latent point positions and features. Sampling in this latent space is found to be faster than sampling dense point clouds, and it also allows for explicit control over both the overall structures and local details of the generated meshes. The proposed method is evaluated on the ShapeNet dataset and demonstrates superior performance in terms of generation quality and controllability compared to existing methods.
