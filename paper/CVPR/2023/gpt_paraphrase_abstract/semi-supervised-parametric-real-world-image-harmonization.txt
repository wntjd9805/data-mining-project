Current learning-based image harmonization techniques are limited in their ability to generalize and model complex local changes due to their training on synthetic data that does not accurately represent appearance mismatches between foreground and background in real composite images. To address this issue, we propose a new semi-supervised training strategy that allows us to learn complex local appearance harmonization from unpaired real composites. Our parametric model utilizes RGB curves to correct global colors and tone, as well as a shading map to capture local variations. Through our approach, we achieve superior performance on established benchmarks and real composites compared to previous methods, as demonstrated in a user study. Our method also supports interactive processing of high-resolution images. Further details, including code and project information, can be found at https://kewang0622.github.io/sprih/.
