Leveraging the relationship between diverse image restoration tasks can help uncover the underlying causes of degradation. While All-in-one methods have been developed to handle multiple image degradations in a single model, they often fail to explore task correlations and become less scalable as more tasks are involved. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Ingredients-oriented Degradation Reformulation (IDR) that focuses on understanding degradation through its fundamental ingredients rather than individual tasks. The IDR framework consists of two stages: task-oriented knowledge collection and ingredients-oriented knowledge integration. In the first stage, we perform specific operations on different degradations based on underlying physics principles and establish prior hubs for each type of degradation. The second stage progressively transforms task-oriented hubs into ingredients-oriented hubs using learnable Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and employs a dynamic routing mechanism for probabilistic removal of unknown degradations. Extensive experiments on various image restoration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method. Importantly, IDR also exhibits strong generalization ability to unknown downstream tasks.
