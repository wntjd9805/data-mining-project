We aim to expand visual recognition tasks by identifying new concepts in a dataset. Currently, these tasks are limited to a small number of classes due to the lack of labels for other classes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a combinatorial learning approach that clusters examples in unseen classes using compositional knowledge from multiple supervised meta-classifiers with different label spaces. Additionally, we enhance the robustness of the representations through unsupervised pairwise relation learning. Our algorithm optimizes the discriminativeness of unseen classes while also learning representations of known classes that can be generalized to novel ones. Through extensive experiments on image retrieval and categorization, our approach shows significant performance improvements and the ability to discover novel classes.
