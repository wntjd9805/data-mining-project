Crowd counting accuracy in images has significantly improved through the use of deep neural networks for predicting crowd density maps. However, most existing methods do not fully explore the potential to localize individuals within the density map. The few approaches that do utilize simple techniques such as identifying local peaks in the density map. In this study, we introduce the optimal transport mini-mization (OT-M) algorithm for crowd localization using density maps. The main objective of OT-M is to find a target point map that minimizes the Sinkhorn distance compared to the input density map. We propose an iterative algorithm to compute this solution. Additionally, we leverage OT-M to generate hard pseudo-labels (point maps) instead of the soft pseudo-labels (density maps) used in previous methods for semi-supervised counting. These hard pseudo-labels offer stronger supervision and allow the use of recent density-to-point loss functions for training. Furthermore, we propose a confidence weighting strategy to assign higher importance to more reliable unlabeled data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the exceptional performance of our methods in both crowd localization and semi-supervised counting tasks.
