Researchers have not given enough attention to scene-dependent anomaly detection in semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD), which is a critical task in intelligent surveillance systems. Additionally, there has been no research on anomaly anticipation, which is an important task for preventing anomalous events. To address these gaps, we introduce a comprehensive dataset called NWPU Campus, which includes 43 scenes, 28 classes of abnormal events, and 16 hours of videos. This dataset is currently the largest semi-supervised VAD dataset, with the highest number of scenes and classes of anomalies, the longest duration, and the only one that considers scene-dependent anomalies. It is also the first dataset designed for video anomaly anticipation. We also propose a novel model that can detect and anticipate anomalous events simultaneously. Our method outperforms seven outstanding VAD algorithms in scene-dependent anomaly detection and anomaly anticipation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ShanghaiTech, CUHK Avenue, IITB Corridor, and NWPU Campus datasets consistently. The NWPU Campus dataset and our code can be accessed at https://campusvad.github.io.
