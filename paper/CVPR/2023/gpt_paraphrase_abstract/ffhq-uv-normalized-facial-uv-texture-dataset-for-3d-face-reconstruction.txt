We have developed a large dataset of facial UV-textures consisting of over 50,000 high-quality UV-maps with consistent lighting, neutral expressions, and cleaned facial regions. These characteristics are important for creating realistic 3D face models in various lighting conditions. The dataset is created by utilizing a fully automatic UV-texture production pipeline, which leverages recent advancements in StyleGAN-based facial image editing techniques to generate multi-view normalized face images. These normalized face images are then processed to extract, correct, and complete high-quality UV-maps. Compared to existing UV-texture datasets, our dataset offers more diversity and higher quality texture maps. Additionally, we have trained a GAN-based texture decoder for parametric fitting based 3D face reconstruction, which improves reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, our method produces high-quality texture maps suitable for realistic renderings. The dataset, code, and pre-trained texture decoder are publicly available.
