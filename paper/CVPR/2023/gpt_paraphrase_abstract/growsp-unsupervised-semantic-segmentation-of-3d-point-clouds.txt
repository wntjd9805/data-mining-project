We present a novel approach called GrowSP for unsupervised 3D semantic segmentation. Unlike existing methods that rely on human annotations or pretrained models, GrowSP identifies complex semantic classes for every point in 3D scenes without any human labels or pretrained models. Our approach utilizes progressive growing of superpoints to discover 3D semantic elements. It consists of three components: a feature extractor to learn per-point features, a superpoint constructor to grow superpoints, and a semantic primitive clustering module to group superpoints for final segmentation. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to unsupervised baselines, approaching the performance of the fully-supervised PointNet. Our work aims to inspire the development of more advanced unsupervised 3D semantic learning methods.
