Graph-based methods have been widely used in the analysis of whole slide histopathology images (WSIs) because they can effectively capture the spatial relationships between different entities. However, most existing methods only consider homogeneous graphs, which limit their ability to capture the complex structural relations between biological entities in WSIs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph-based framework for WSI analysis. In our framework, we model the WSI as a heterogeneous graph, where each node is assigned a "nucleus-type" attribute and each edge has a semantic similarity attribute. To leverage the heterogeneity of the graph, we introduce a new heterogeneous-graph edge attribute transformer (HEAT) that aggregates information from nodes and edges. Additionally, we design a new pooling mechanism that uses pseudo-labels to ensure semantic consistency and overcome the over-parameterization issue in conventional cluster-based pooling. Furthermore, we propose a causal-driven approach to attribute the contribution of each node, enhancing the interpretability of our framework. We evaluate our framework on three public TCGA benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various tasks. The source code for our framework is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/WSI-HGNN.
