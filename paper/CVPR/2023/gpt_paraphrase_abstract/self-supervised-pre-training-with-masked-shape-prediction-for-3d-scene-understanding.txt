This paper introduces Masked Shape Prediction (MSP), a new framework for masked signal modeling in 3D scenes. MSP utilizes the geometric shape as the prediction target for masked points, aiming to exploit contextual cues in shape prediction. To enhance shape prediction, a context-enhanced shape target is proposed, consisting of explicit shape context and implicit deep shape features. The pre-training architecture in MSP is designed to prevent the leakage of masked shape information from point coordinates. Experimental results on various 3D understanding tasks demonstrate that MSP effectively learns feature representations that consistently improve downstream performance.
