During supervised object detection training, the objective is to accurately match predicted bounding boxes and their corresponding classification scores to the ground truth. This matching process is crucial for determining which predictions should be associated with which solutions or discarded altogether. Currently, there are two popular matching strategies: matching to the closest ground truth box (often used with anchors) and matching through the Hungarian algorithm (commonly used in anchor-free methods). Each strategy has its own characteristics, underlying losses, and heuristics.In this study, we propose a new approach called Unbalanced Optimal Transport that unifies these different matching strategies and introduces a continuum of methods in between. This allows for more precise selection of desired properties in object detection models. We conducted experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of training an object detection model using Unbalanced Optimal Transport. The results show that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of Average Precision and Average Recall, while also facilitating faster initial convergence. Additionally, the approach is well-suited for GPU implementation, making it advantageous for large-scale models.
