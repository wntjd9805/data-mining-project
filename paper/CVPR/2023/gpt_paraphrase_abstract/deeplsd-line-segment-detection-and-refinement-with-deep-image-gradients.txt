Line segments are commonly found in our human-made world and are increasingly used in computer vision tasks. They provide valuable spatial and structural information, making them complementary to feature points. However, traditional line detectors based on image gradient have limitations in handling noisy images and challenging conditions. On the other hand, learned line detectors are more robust but sacrifice accuracy and tend to favor wireframe lines.To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that combines traditional and learned techniques. Our line segment detector, DeepLSD, utilizes a deep network to generate a line attraction field from input images. This field is then converted into a surrogate image gradient magnitude and angle, which is fed into an existing handcrafted line detector. Additionally, we introduce a new optimization method that refines line segments based on the attraction field and vanishing points. This refinement significantly improves the accuracy of deep detectors.We evaluate the performance of our method using various low-level line detection metrics and multiple challenging datasets for downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepLSD in achieving accurate and robust line detection. To facilitate further research, we have made the source code and models available on our GitHub repository (https://github.com/cvg/DeepLSD).
