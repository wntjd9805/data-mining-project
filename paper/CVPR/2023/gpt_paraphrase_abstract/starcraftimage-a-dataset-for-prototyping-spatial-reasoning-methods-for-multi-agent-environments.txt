Spatial reasoning tasks in multi-agent environments are crucial for various applications such as event prediction, agent type identification, and missing data imputation. These tasks are particularly relevant in the context of autonomous surveillance and reinforcement learning. However, utilizing StarCraft II game replays as a testbed for these tasks is challenging due to the laborious process of extracting simple and standardized representations. In contrast, datasets like MNIST and CIFAR10 have facilitated rapid prototyping and reproducibility in machine learning. To address this limitation, we have created a benchmark spatial reasoning dataset based on StarCraft II replays that exhibit complex multi-agent behaviors while being as user-friendly as MNIST and CIFAR10. Our dataset consists of 3.6 million summary images derived from 60,000 replays, with each image representing a window of 255 consecutive game states. The dataset includes relevant metadata such as game outcome and player races. We have developed three formats of decreasing complexity: hyperspectral images with channels for each unit type, RGB images similar to CIFAR10, and grayscale images resembling MNIST. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset for prototyping spatial reasoning methods. The datasets, extraction code, and dataset loading code can be accessed at https://starcraftdata.davidinouye.com/.
