This paper introduces a new framework called curricular object manipulation (COM) for curriculum learning in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. The framework incorporates a curricular training strategy into both the loss design and augmentation process. In terms of loss design, the COMLoss is proposed to dynamically predict the difficulty of objects and prioritize objects of different difficulty levels during different training stages. Additionally, a novel augmentation strategy called COMAug is proposed, which clusters objects in a ground-truth database and predicts group-level difficulties for stable training results. By progressively sampling and augmenting more difficult objects in the training samples, the framework improves model performance and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed framework. The code for the framework is available at https://github.com/ZZY816/COM.
