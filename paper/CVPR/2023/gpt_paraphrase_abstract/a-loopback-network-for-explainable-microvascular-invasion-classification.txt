Microvascular invasion (MVI) plays a crucial role in evaluating prognosis and treating cancer. However, the current method of diagnosing MVI is time-consuming and subjective, as it relies on pathologists manually identifying cancerous cells in blood vessels. Deep learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, but its lack of explainability and need for extensive annotated samples limit its clinical application. To address this, we propose a Loop-back Network (LoopNet) for efficient classification of MVI. LoopNet consists of a binary classification branch and a cell locating branch, which identifies cancerous cells, regular non-cancerous cells, and background areas. By using pseudo masks for healthy samples, the cell locating branch learns to distinguish regular non-cancerous cells and background areas. For MVI samples, the cell locating branch predicts the mask of cancerous cells, which is then used to input the masked cancerous and non-cancerous areas separately into the binary classification branch. This loopback mechanism allows the category label to guide the cell locating branch in learning to locate cancerous areas. Experimental results demonstrate that LoopNet achieves an accuracy of 97.5% in MVI classification. Interestingly, the loopback mechanism not only enables accurate prediction of cancerous areas but also improves the overall classification performance.
