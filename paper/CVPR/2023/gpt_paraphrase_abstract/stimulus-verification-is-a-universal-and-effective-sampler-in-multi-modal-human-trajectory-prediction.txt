To comprehensively address the uncertainty of future human trajectories, a common approach in multi-modal prediction is to generate a set of potential trajectories and then sample a final prediction from them. However, little attention has been given to the effective sampling of these final predictions. In this study, we propose stimulus verification as a universal and effective sampling process to enhance multi-modal prediction. Stimulus verification involves using a probabilistic model, known as a stimulus verifier, to assess the coherence between a predicted trajectory and its corresponding stimulus factors, such as social interaction and scene context. By prioritizing prediction samples that exhibit better stimulus-coherence, stimulus verification ensures that the sampled trajectories are plausible from the stimulus' perspective, leading to improved multi-modal prediction performance. We apply stimulus verification to five prediction frameworks and conduct extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
