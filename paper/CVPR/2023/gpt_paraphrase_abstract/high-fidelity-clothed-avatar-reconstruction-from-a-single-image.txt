This paper introduces a new framework for efficiently reconstructing 3D clothed avatars. The framework combines the accuracy of optimization-based methods with the efficiency of learning-based methods to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction from a single image. The process consists of two stages: first, a general shape is learned using an implicit model in the canonical space of a person; then, surface details are refined by estimating non-rigid deformation in the posed space through optimization. To accelerate the optimization process, a hyper-network is employed to generate a good initialization. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed method successfully generates high-fidelity avatars of clothed humans in real scenes. The code for this framework is available at https://github.com/TingtingLiao/CAR.
