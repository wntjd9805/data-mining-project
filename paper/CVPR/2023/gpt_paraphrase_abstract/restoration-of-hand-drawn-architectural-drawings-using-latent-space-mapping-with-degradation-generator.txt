This research focuses on restoring deteriorated hand-drawn drawings of wooden built heritage. These drawings are essential for preserving important original information; however, they often suffer from severe degradation over time. To address this issue, a new restoration technique is introduced, utilizing vector quantized variational autoencoders. By learning latent space representations of drawings and noise, this method can effectively restore noisy drawings to their clean counterparts and generate realistic noisy drawings for data augmentation. The approach is applied to restore drawings in the Cultural Heritage Administration's archive, resulting in significantly improved quality and facilitating more accurate interpretations of information.
