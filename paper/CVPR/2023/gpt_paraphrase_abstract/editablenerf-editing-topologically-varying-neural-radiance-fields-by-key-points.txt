The abstract discusses the challenges of editing scenes modeled by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and proposes a solution called editable neural radiance fields. This new approach allows end-users to easily edit dynamic scenes, including supporting topological changes. The network is trained automatically using an image sequence from a single camera and models the varying dynamics of the scene using surface key points. Users can edit the scene by moving these key points to new positions. The method includes a scene analysis technique to detect and initialize key points based on the dynamics of the scene, as well as a weighted key points strategy to model the changing dynamics. The method supports intuitive multi-dimensional editing and can generate new scenes not seen in the input sequence. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high-quality editing on various dynamic scenes and outperforms existing techniques. The code and captured data for the method are available at the provided link.
