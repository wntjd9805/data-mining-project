Recently, there have been significant advancements in Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), which involves object detection, feature embedding, and identity association. Current methods use a three-step or two-step approach to generate reliable trajectories, where identity association is treated independently. However, this independent identity association fails to utilize the valuable identity-aware knowledge present in the tracklet to enhance the detection and embedding modules. To address this limitation, we propose a new Unified Tracking Model (UTM) that connects these three components to create a positive feedback loop with mutual benefits. The key concept of UTM is the Identity-Aware Feature Enhancement (IAFE), which leverages the identity-aware knowledge to improve detection and embedding. Specifically, IAFE consists of two components: Identity-Aware Boosting Attention (IABA) and Identity-Aware Erasing Attention (IAEA). IABA enhances the consistent regions between the current frame feature and identity-aware knowledge, while IAEA suppresses the distracted regions in the current frame feature. By improving the quality of detections and embeddings, UTM generates higher-quality tracklets. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks, using both public and private detections, demonstrate the robustness of UTM.
