This paper presents Pix2Map, a method for inferring urban street map topology from ego-view images to update and expand existing maps for self-driving vehicles. The task is challenging as it requires inferring complex road topology directly from raw image data. The paper proposes a solution by using cross-modal retrieval and learning a joint embedding space for images and existing maps represented as discrete graphs. The authors evaluate their method using the Argoverse dataset and demonstrate accurate retrieval of street maps for both seen and unseen roads solely from image data. They also show that the retrieved maps can be used to update or expand existing maps and provide proof-of-concept results for visual localization and image retrieval from spatial graphs.
