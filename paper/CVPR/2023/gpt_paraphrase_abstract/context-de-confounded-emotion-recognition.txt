Context-Aware Emotion Recognition (CAER) is a crucial and challenging task that aims to detect the emotional states of a person by considering contextual information. Previous approaches have focused on designing complex architectures to extract meaningful representations from individuals and their contexts. However, an overlooked issue is the presence of a context bias in existing datasets, resulting in an imbalanced distribution of emotional states across different context scenarios. This bias confounds existing models, leading them to learn spurious correlations and limiting their performance. To address this issue, this paper introduces a causality-based perspective to untangle the models from the impact of the bias. A tailored causal graph is formulated to establish causal relationships among variables in the CAER task. Additionally, a Contextual Causal Intervention Module (CCIM) is proposed, utilizing backdoor adjustment to de-confound the bias and leverage the true causal effect for model training. CCIM is a plug-in and model-agnostic solution that significantly improves various state-of-the-art approaches. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCIM and the importance of causal insight.
