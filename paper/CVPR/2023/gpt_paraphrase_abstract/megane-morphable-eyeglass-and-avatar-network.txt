Eyeglasses are important for shaping one's identity, and virtual representations of faces can benefit from including realistic glasses. However, accurately modeling the interactions between glasses and virtual human faces is challenging. Glasses and faces affect each other's shape and appearance due to physical interactions and light transport. Most existing methods do not capture these interactions because they treat glasses and faces separately. Other approaches try to solve the problem as a 2D image synthesis task but suffer from inconsistencies. In this study, we propose a 3D compositional morphable model of glasses that accurately considers geometric and photometric effects. To efficiently handle the wide variety of glasses shapes, we use a hybrid representation that combines surface geometry and volumetric representation. Unlike volumetric methods, our model maintains correspondences across glasses, simplifying modifications like lens insertion and frame deformation. Additionally, our model supports realistic rendering of various frame materials, including translucent plastic and metal, under different lighting conditions. It also considers global light transport effects such as casting shadows. Our morphable model can be fitted to novel glasses using inverse rendering, and we demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality improvement.
