Stereo-based 3D object detection has shown promise in terms of cost and performance compared to LiDAR and monocular-based methods, respectively. However, the high-quality manual annotations required for accurate detection pose a challenge. To address this, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach for stereo-based 3D object detection. Our method involves generating pseudo annotations using a temporal-aggregated teacher model that accumulates knowledge from a student model. We also introduce a Temporal-Aggregation-Guided (TAG) disparity consistency constraint to improve depth estimation. To reduce noise in pseudo annotation generation, we propose a cross-view agreement strategy that ensures consistency between 3D and 2D views, as well as between binocular views. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in leveraging unannotated stereo images to achieve significantly improved detection results.
