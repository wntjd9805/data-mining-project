This study focuses on minimizing the cost of annotating videos for action detection, which typically requires labeling each frame. The researchers propose a hybrid active learning (AL) strategy that combines intra-sample and inter-sample selection methods. Intra-sample selection reduces the number of frames to be labeled within a video, while inter-sample selection operates at the video level. This hybrid approach effectively reduces the overall annotation cost by considering both aspects. The strategy incorporates Clustering-Aware Uncertainty Scoring (CLAUS), a new method for selecting informative and diverse samples. Additionally, the researchers introduce a Spatio-Temporal Weighted (STeW) loss formulation to facilitate model training with limited annotations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB-21 datasets, where it consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of annotation cost reduction.

Figure 1 presents a comparison between the CLAUS-based AL method and random selection for video action detection, showing the model's performance scores on UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB-21 datasets at different annotation amounts. The green line represents the model's performance with 90% of the annotations.
