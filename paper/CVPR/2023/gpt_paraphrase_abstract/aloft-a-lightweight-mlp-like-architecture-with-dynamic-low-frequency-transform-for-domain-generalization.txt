This study focuses on domain generalization (DG) techniques, which aim to develop models that can effectively generalize to new, unseen domains by utilizing multiple source domains without the need for re-training. While most existing DG methods rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the authors argue that the local operation of the convolution kernel in CNNs leads to an overemphasis on local representations, such as texture, which in turn hinders the model's ability to generalize well. In contrast, recent supervised learning tasks have shown promising results using MLP-based methods that can capture global interactions among different patches of an image, allowing for better generalization.Building on this observation, the authors conduct a comparative analysis between CNN and MLP methods in the context of DG and find that MLP methods exhibit stronger generalization abilities due to their capacity to capture global representations, such as structure. Leveraging a lightweight MLP method as a baseline, the authors introduce a filter that can learn global structure representations while suppressing structure-irrelevant information in the frequency space. Additionally, they propose a dynamic low-frequency spectrum transform called ALOFT, which perturbs local texture features while preserving global structure features. This enables the filter to effectively remove structure-irrelevant information.The authors conduct extensive experiments on four benchmarks and demonstrate that their method achieves significant performance improvements with a small number of parameters compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based DG methods. They provide their code on GitHub for reproducibility purposes. The study is supported by various research programs and foundations.In summary, this research explores the limitations of CNN-based DG methods and highlights the advantages of MLP methods in capturing global representations. The authors propose a lightweight MLP baseline with a filtering mechanism and introduce the ALOFT transform to enhance the model's ability to remove structure-irrelevant information. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of their method compared to CNN-based DG methods, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
