Detecting human-object contact is crucial for developing human-centered artificial intelligence. However, there is currently no reliable method or dataset available to detect contact between the body and the scene from an image. To address this gap, we introduce HOT ("Human-Object conTact"), a novel dataset of human-object contacts in images. HOT is constructed using two data sources: first, we utilize the PROX dataset, which consists of 3D human meshes moving in 3D scenes, to automatically annotate 2D image areas for contact based on 3D mesh proximity and projection. Second, we incorporate the V-COCO, HAKE, and Watch-n-Patch datasets and task trained annotators with drawing polygons around the 2D image areas where contact occurs. Additionally, we annotate the specific body part involved in the contact. Leveraging the HOT dataset, we train a contact detector that takes a single color image as input and generates 2D contact heatmaps along with body-part labels indicating the areas of contact. This novel task expands the current detection capabilities beyond foot-ground or hand-object contact to encompass the entire body. Our detector incorporates a part-attention branch to guide contact estimation by considering the context of the surrounding body parts and scene. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline methods, with all components contributing to improved performance. Moreover, our detector exhibits reasonable detections and generalizability when applied to images from an online repository. We have made the HOT dataset and model publicly available for further research at https://hot.is.tue.mpg.de.
