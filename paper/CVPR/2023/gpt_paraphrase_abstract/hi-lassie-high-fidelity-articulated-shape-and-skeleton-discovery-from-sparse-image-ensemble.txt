The problem of automatically estimating 3D skeleton, shape, camera viewpoints, and part articulation from sparse in-the-wild image ensembles is difficult due to a lack of constraints. Existing methods often rely on large datasets, temporal correspondence, or human annotations. In this study, we propose Hi-LASSIE, an approach that can reconstruct 3D articulated objects using only 20-30 online images without any user-defined templates. Our method builds upon the work of LASSIE but introduces two important improvements. Firstly, we automatically estimate a class-specific skeleton instead of relying on manual annotations. Secondly, we enhance shape reconstructions by employing instance-specific optimization strategies that preserve class-specific priors. Experimental results demonstrate that Hi-LASSIE outperforms existing methods in terms of fidelity, while requiring minimal user input.
