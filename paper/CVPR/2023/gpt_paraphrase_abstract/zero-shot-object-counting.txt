The current approach to class-agnostic object counting requires human-annotated exemplars as input, which is often not available for new categories and autonomous systems. To address this, we propose a new setting called zero-shot object counting (ZSC), where only the class name is provided during testing. Our method starts with the class name and accurately identifies optimal patches that can be used as counting exemplars. We achieve this by constructing a class prototype to select patches likely to contain the objects of interest and using a model to measure the suitability of patches as counting exemplars. Experimental results on the FSC-147 dataset confirm the effectiveness of our method, which eliminates the need for human annotators and operates automatically.
