We present a new solution for accurate and fast bundle adjustment (BA) in estimating the 6-DoF pose using a rolling shutter (RS) camera. Existing methods face challenges such as relying on high frame rate video, restrictive assumptions on camera motion, and poor efficiency. Our approach addresses these issues by incorporating image point normalization and introducing a visual residual covariance model to improve accuracy. We also propose a combination of normalization and covariance standardization weighting (NW-RSBA) to overcome planar degeneracy without constraining the filming manner. Additionally, we propose an acceleration strategy for NW-RSBA based on the sparsity of its Jacobian matrix and Schur complement. Extensive experiments using synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution compared to existing approaches.
