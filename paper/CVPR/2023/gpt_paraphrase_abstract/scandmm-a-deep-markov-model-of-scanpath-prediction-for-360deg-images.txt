This paper introduces a novel scanpath prediction method, ScanDMM, for 360◦ images. Unlike existing methods, ScanDMM considers the time-dependency of human scanpaths, resulting in improved performance and generalizability. The method utilizes a Deep Markov Model (DMM) architecture and incorporates a semantics-guided transition function to capture the nonlinear dynamics of attentional landscapes over time. Additionally, a state initialization strategy is proposed to ensure accurate modeling of the starting point of viewing. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through its superior performance on four 360◦ image databases. Furthermore, the study explores the application of scanpath prediction models in saliency detection and image quality assessment tasks, highlighting the potential insights it can provide in these areas.
