Current differentiable renderers can calculate gradients of light transport with respect to scene parameters. However, the presence of these gradients does not guarantee effective optimization updates. There may be regions of zero gradient, known as plateaus, that prevent convergence in inverse rendering. To address this issue, we propose using a kernel to blur the parameter space, reducing plateaus. We introduce two Monte Carlo estimators for efficiently computing gradients with reduced variance, leading to improved optimization error and runtime performance. Our approach can be applied to both black-box and differentiable renderers and allows for optimization of complex light transport problems that current differentiable renderers struggle with, such as caustics or global illumination.
