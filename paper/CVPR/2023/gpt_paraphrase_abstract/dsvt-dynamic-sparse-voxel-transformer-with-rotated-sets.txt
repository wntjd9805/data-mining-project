We present Dynamic Sparse Voxel points Transformer (DSVT), a voxel-based backbone for handling sparse point clouds in outdoor 3D perception. To efficiently process sparse points, we propose Dynamic Sparse Window Attention, which partitions local regions based on sparsity and computes features in parallel. We also introduce an attention-style 3D pooling module for downsampling and encoding geometric information without customized CUDA operations. DSVT achieves state-of-the-art performance in various 3D perception tasks and can be easily deployed with real-time inference speed. Code is available at https://github.com/Haiyang-W/DSVT.
