Current methods for detecting facial action units (AUs) primarily rely on analyzing appearance information from 2D images and often neglect the underlying biomechanics of facial skin deformation in 3D. In this study, we propose a new approach that incorporates facial muscle activation forces into AU detection by considering the biomechanics of facial deformation. Our model consists of two branches: a 3D physics branch and a 2D image branch. In the 3D physics branch, we derive the Euler-Lagrange equation that governs facial deformation. This equation is then embedded into a differentiable ODE solver, allowing us to regress muscle activation forces and other physics parameters. These forces are subsequently used to simulate 3D facial deformation by solving the ODE. By incorporating facial biomechanics, we are able to obtain realistic muscle activation forces.The 2D image branch complements the 3D physics branch by incorporating additional appearance information from 2D images. Both the estimated forces from the 3D branch and the appearance features from the 2D branch are utilized for AU detection.Our proposed approach demonstrates competitive performance in AU detection on two benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by leveraging biomechanics, our approach achieves outstanding performance even with reduced training data.In summary, our novel biomechanics-guided AU detection approach combines both 3D physics and 2D appearance information to improve the accuracy of AU detection. By considering the underlying facial biomechanics, we are able to achieve better performance and reduce reliance on large training datasets.
