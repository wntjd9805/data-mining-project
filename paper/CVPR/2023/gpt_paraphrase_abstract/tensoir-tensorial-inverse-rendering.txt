We present TensoIR, a new approach to inverse rendering using tensor factorization and neural fields. Unlike previous methods that rely solely on MLP-based neural fields, which have limited capacity and high computation costs, we extend the state-of-the-art TensoRF approach to estimate scene geometry, surface reflectance, and environment illumination from multi-view images taken under unknown lighting conditions. By combining radiance field reconstruction and physically-based model estimation, our approach enables realistic synthesis of new views and relighting effects. Leveraging the efficiency and extensibility of the TensoRF-based representation, our method accurately models secondary shading effects, such as shadows and indirect lighting, and works with input images captured under single or multiple unknown lighting conditions. The low-rank tensor representation allows for fast and compact reconstruction while also leveraging shared information across various lighting conditions. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations on challenging synthetic and real-world scenes, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline approaches.
