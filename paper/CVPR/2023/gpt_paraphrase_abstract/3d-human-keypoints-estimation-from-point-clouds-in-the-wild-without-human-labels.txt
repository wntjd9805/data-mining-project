This study introduces GC-KPL, a method for training a 3D human keypoint detector using point clouds without the need for expensive and error-prone human labels. The proposed approach utilizes unsupervised loss formulations that consider the structure and movement of the human body. By training on a large dataset without human annotated keypoints, the model achieves reasonable performance compared to fully supervised methods. Additionally, the unsupervised training benefits the backbone of the model, enabling efficient few-shot learning of keypoints. GC-KPL outperforms the state-of-the-art when trained on the entire dataset and effectively utilizes large amounts of unlabeled data.
