Federated learning aims to ensure data privacy while coordinating multiple users in data training. This approach can be connected to collective intelligence when multiple agents collaborate. However, when there are significant differences in data distribution among users, it is crucial to develop a reliable client selection strategy and an interpretable client communication framework to effectively utilize group knowledge. This study introduces a personalized federated learning approach called RIPFL, which is explained from the perspective of social learning. RIPFL selects and divides clients involved in training in a reliable manner, allowing each client to use varying amounts of social information and communicate more effectively with others. Additionally, the method integrates personal and social information using Bayesian decision rules and evidence theory, leveraging collective wisdom to enhance individual growth. The proposed interpretable federated learning approach is scalable and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of robustness and accuracy, as evidenced by experimental results.
