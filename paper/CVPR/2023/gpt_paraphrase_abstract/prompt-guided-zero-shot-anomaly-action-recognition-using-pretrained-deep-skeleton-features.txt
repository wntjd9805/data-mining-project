This study explores the detection of abnormal human behavior events in videos without the use of abnormal samples, addressing key limitations of existing skeleton-based approaches. The research proposes a unified framework for unsupervised anomaly action recognition, employing a target domain-independent skeleton feature extractor that is pretrained on a large-scale action recognition dataset. During training, the method models the distribution of skeleton features for normal actions while keeping the DNN weights fixed, and uses this distribution to estimate anomaly scores during inference. To enhance robustness against skeleton errors, a DNN architecture inspired by point cloud deep learning is introduced, enabling sparse propagation of features between joints. Additionally, to prevent misidentification of unobserved normal actions as abnormal, a similarity score between user prompt embeddings and skeleton features in a common space is incorporated into the anomaly score. Experimental evaluations conducted on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in overcoming the aforementioned limitations.
