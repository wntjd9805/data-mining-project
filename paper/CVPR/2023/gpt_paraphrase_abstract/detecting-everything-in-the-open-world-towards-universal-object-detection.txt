This paper presents the concept of universal object detection, which aims to detect and classify objects in any scene. Traditional detectors are limited in their universality due to their reliance on human annotations, limited visual information, and the presence of novel categories in the open world. To address these limitations, the authors propose UniDetector, a universal object detector that can recognize a wide range of categories in the open world. The key factors that contribute to the universality of UniDetector are: 1) the use of images from multiple sources and diverse label spaces to train the detector, ensuring sufficient information for universal representations; 2) the ability to generalize to the open world by maintaining a balance between seen and unseen classes, leveraging abundant information from both vision and language modalities; and 3) the promotion of generalization to novel categories through a proposed decoupling training approach and probability calibration. These contributions enable UniDetector to detect over 7k categories, the largest measurable category size to date, with training only on about 500 classes. UniDetector demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability on large-vocabulary datasets, outperforming traditional supervised baselines by more than 4% on average without having seen corresponding images. Furthermore, UniDetector achieves state-of-the-art performance on 13 public detection datasets with various scenes using only 3% of the training data.
