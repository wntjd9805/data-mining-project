We introduce vMAP, a novel object-level dense SLAM system that uses neural field representations. Instead of relying on 3D priors, each object is represented by a small MLP, enabling efficient and accurate object modeling. Without any prior information, vMAP detects object instances in real-time and incorporates them into its map. Through vectorized training, vMAP can optimize up to 50 individual objects in a single scene, updating the map at a speed of 5Hz. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both scene-level and object-level reconstruction quality compared to previous neural field SLAM systems.
