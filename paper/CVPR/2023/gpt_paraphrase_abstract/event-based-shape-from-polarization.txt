Current Shape-from-Polarization (SfP) solutions face a tradeoff between speed and resolution, either sacrificing the number of polarization angles measured or requiring lengthy acquisition times due to framerate limitations. To address this tradeoff, we propose the use of event cameras, which offer high temporal resolution and minimal motion blur. Our approach involves a setup with a rapidly rotating linear polarizer in front of an event camera, using the continuous stream of events generated by the rotation to reconstruct relative intensities at different polarizer angles. Experimental results show that our method outperforms physics-based baselines using frames, achieving a 25% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in both synthetic and real-world datasets. However, we also observe that challenging conditions with low event generation negatively impact the performance of physics-based solutions. To overcome this, we propose a learning-based approach that can estimate surface normals even at low event rates, improving the physics-based approach by 52% on real-world data. Our proposed system achieves an acquisition speed equivalent to 50 frames per second (more than twice the framerate of commercial polarization sensors) while maintaining a spatial resolution of 1 megapixel. We provide a comprehensive evaluation based on the first large-scale dataset for event-based SfP, along with the availability of code, dataset, and video demonstrations.
