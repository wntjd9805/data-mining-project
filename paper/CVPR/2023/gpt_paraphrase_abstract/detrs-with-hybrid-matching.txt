The core meaning of the abstract is that one-to-one set matching is crucial for the end-to-end capability of DETR in object detection. However, this matching approach reduces the effectiveness of positive samples during training. To address this, the authors propose a hybrid matching scheme that combines one-to-one matching with one-to-many matching during training. This hybrid strategy significantly improves accuracy without compromising the end-to-end merit and inference efficiency of DETR. The method, named DETR, can consistently enhance various DETR methods for a wide range of visual tasks. The code for this method is available at the provided GitHub link.
