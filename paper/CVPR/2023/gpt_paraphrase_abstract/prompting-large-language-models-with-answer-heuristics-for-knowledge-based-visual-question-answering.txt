Knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) requires additional knowledge beyond the image to answer questions. Previous studies have used explicit knowledge bases (KBs) to retrieve this information, but often include irrelevant details that limit model performance. Recent approaches have explored using a large language model like GPT-3 as an implicit knowledge source. However, we argue that these methods have not fully utilized the potential of GPT-3 due to insufficient input information.   To address this, we propose Prophet, a straightforward framework that leverages GPT-3 by providing answer heuristics for knowledge-based VQA. Firstly, we train a basic VQA model on a specific dataset without external knowledge. Then, we extract two types of answer heuristics from the model: answer candidates and answer-aware examples. These heuristics are incorporated into prompts to enable GPT-3 to better understand the task and enhance its capabilities.   Prophet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets, OK-VQA and A-OKVQA. It achieves accuracies of 61.1% and 55.7% on their respective testing sets. The answer format focuses solely on the abstraction of the answer.
