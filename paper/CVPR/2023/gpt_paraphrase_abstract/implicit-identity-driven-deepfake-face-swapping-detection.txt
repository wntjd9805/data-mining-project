This paper explores the detection of face swapping based on face identity. Face swapping involves replacing a target face with a source face in order to generate a fake face that appears indistinguishable from a real face. The fake face comprises explicit and implicit identities, representing the identities of the source and target faces respectively. The explicit identities can be identified using regular face recognition techniques. Notably, the implicit identity of a real face aligns with its explicit identity. This distinction between explicit and implicit identity can aid in detecting face swapping. To address this, a novel framework driven by implicit identity is proposed for face swapping detection. The framework incorporates an explicit identity contrast (EIC) loss and an implicit identity exploration (IIE) loss, which guide a CNN backbone in embedding face images into the implicit identity space. The EIC loss ensures that real samples are closer to their explicit identities, while fake samples are pushed away from their explicit identities. The IIE loss, based on a margin-based classification loss function, encourages intra-class compactness and inter-class diversity among fake faces with known target identities. Extensive experiments and visualizations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.
