Traditional semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) techniques using one-stage detectors have not been as effective as two-stage detectors. This is due to two types of ambiguities: selection ambiguity and assignment ambiguity. Selection ambiguity arises because class scores do not accurately represent the quality of localization. Assignment ambiguity occurs when samples are wrongly matched with labels due to missed objects and inaccurate pseudo boxes. To address these issues, we propose Ambiguity-Resistant Semi-supervised Learning (ARSL) for one-stage detectors. First, Joint-Confidence Estimation (JCE) is introduced to quantify the classification and localization quality of pseudo labels, reducing selection ambiguity. Second, Task-Separation Assignment (TSA) assigns labels based on pixel-level predictions instead of unreliable pseudo boxes, using a divide-and-conquer approach to handle assignment ambiguity. Experimental results on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that ARSL effectively mitigates ambiguities and achieves state-of-the-art performance in SSOD.
