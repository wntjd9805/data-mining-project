This abstract discusses the problem of biased datasets in machine learning and the limitations of existing debiased learning models in distributed settings like federated learning. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel framework called Bias-Eliminating Augmentation Learning (FedBEAL) for debiased federated learning. FedBEAL learns to deploy Bias-Eliminating Augmenters (BEA) at each client to generate client-specific bias-conflicting samples. A unique learning strategy is presented to jointly train BEA with the federated learning framework. The effectiveness and applicability of FedBEAL are demonstrated through extensive image classification experiments on datasets with various bias types, outperforming state-of-the-art debiasing and federated learning methods.
