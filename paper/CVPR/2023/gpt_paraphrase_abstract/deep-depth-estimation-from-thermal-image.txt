Achieving robust and accurate geometric understanding in adverse weather conditions is crucial for the autonomy of self-driving cars. However, existing autonomous driving algorithms that rely on visible spectrum bands are easily affected by weather and lighting conditions. To address this issue, a potential solution is the use of long-wave infrared cameras, also known as thermal imaging cameras, to enhance robustness. However, there is a lack of well-established large-scale datasets and public benchmark results in this domain. In this paper, we present the creation of a large-scale Multi-Spectral Stereo (MS2) dataset, which includes stereo RGB, stereo NIR, stereo thermal, and stereo LiDAR data, along with GNSS/IMU information. This dataset consists of approximately 195,000 synchronized data pairs collected from various urban and suburban areas, captured in different weather conditions and at different times of the day. We then conduct a comprehensive validation process of monocular and stereo depth estimation algorithms designed for visible spectrum bands, to assess their performance in the thermal image domain. Finally, we propose a unified depth network that effectively combines monocular and stereo depth tasks using a conditional random field approach. Our dataset and source code are publicly available, allowing researchers to access and utilize them for further advancements in this field. Our proposed network is capable of estimating both monocular and stereo depth maps from thermal images, regardless of whether a single or stereo thermal image is provided. Furthermore, the depth estimation results from thermal images demonstrate high reliability and robustness, even under challenging lighting and weather conditions. Figure 1 illustrates the depth estimation process from thermal images in various environments. In conclusion, our research contributes to the development of robust autonomous driving algorithms by providing a large-scale dataset and benchmark results in the thermal image domain. The proposed unified depth network shows promising performance in estimating depth maps from thermal images, offering improved reliability and robustness for self-driving cars in adverse weather conditions.
