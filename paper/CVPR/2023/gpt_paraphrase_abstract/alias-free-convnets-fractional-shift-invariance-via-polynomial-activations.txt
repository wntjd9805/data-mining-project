Although CNNs were previously thought to be unaffected by translations, recent research has demonstrated that this is not true due to aliasing effects caused by down-sampling layers. The existing solutions to address these aliasing effects are only partially effective as they fail to resolve the issues originating from non-linearities. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced anti-aliasing approach that addresses both down-sampling and non-linear layers, resulting in truly alias-free and shift-invariant CNNs. Our model demonstrates invariance to both integer and fractional translations, surpassing other shift-invariant methods in terms of its ability to withstand adversarial translations.
