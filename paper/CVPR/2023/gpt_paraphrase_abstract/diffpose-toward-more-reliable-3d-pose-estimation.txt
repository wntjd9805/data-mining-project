Monocular 3D human pose estimation is a challenging task due to ambiguity and occlusion, which result in high uncertainty and indeterminacy. Recently, diffusion models have shown promise in generating high-quality images from noise. Inspired by their effectiveness, we introduce DiffPose, a novel framework for pose estimation. DiffPose formulates 3D pose estimation as a reverse diffusion process and incorporates several innovative designs to enhance the diffusion process. These include a pose-specific initialization of pose uncertainty distributions, a forward diffusion process based on Gaussian Mixture Models, and a context-conditioned reverse diffusion process. Our proposed DiffPose outperforms existing methods on popular pose estimation benchmarks such as Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.
