We present a novel light steering technology that operates at high frequencies, is cost-effective, and does not require any moving parts. This technology has the potential to greatly benefit various projector and imaging systems that rely on fast, reliable, inexpensive, and wavelength-independent light steering, such as laser scanning projectors, LiDAR sensors, and fluorescence microscopes. Our approach utilizes ultrasound waves to create a dynamically changing refractive index field within a compressible medium (e.g., water), effectively transforming the medium into a movable lens. By controlling the electrical input to the ultrasound transducers responsible for generating the waves, we can alter the lens and steer light at the speed of sound (1.5 km/s in water). We have constructed a physical prototype of this technology, which enables us to achieve scanning techniques at megahertz rates â€“ three orders of magnitude faster than existing commercial options like galvo mirror scanners. Furthermore, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our technology through projector and LiDAR applications. To foster further advancements in this field, we have established theoretical limits for our technology and developed an accurate simulator for virtual design. Overall, our technology presents a promising solution for achieving high-speed and cost-effective light steering in various applications.
