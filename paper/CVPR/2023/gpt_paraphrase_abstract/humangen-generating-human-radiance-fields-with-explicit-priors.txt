In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating realistic radiance fields. However, generating high-quality human radiance fields still poses a challenge, largely due to the limited incorporation of human-related priors in existing methods. To address this, we propose HumanGen, a novel approach that combines 3D human generation with priors from both 2D generators and 3D human reconstructors through the use of an "anchor image". We introduce a hybrid feature representation that connects the latent space of HumanGen with the existing 2D generator. Our approach focuses on disentangling the generation of geometry and appearance, leveraging the anchor image to facilitate fine-grained detail synthesis through a 3D reconstructor and a two-stage blending scheme to enhance appearance generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HumanGen in achieving state-of-the-art 3D human generation in terms of geometry details, texture quality, and performance in free-view rendering. Moreover, HumanGen can seamlessly incorporate various off-the-shelf 2D latent editing methods, allowing for their application in the 3D domain.
