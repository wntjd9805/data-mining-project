Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection aims to detect frame-level anomalies in videos using video-level labeled training data. This task is challenging due to the limited supervision provided by weak labels and the ambiguity of the boundary between normal and abnormal instances, which can vary depending on the context. To address these challenges, we propose the Class-Activate Feature Learning (CLAV) method, which extracts discriminative features by widening the gap between classes' features using a single backbone branch. CLAV achieves this by implicitly activating weights depending on the class and enlarging the gap through relative distance learning. Additionally, we introduce the Context-Motion Interrelation Module (CoMo) to capture the relationship between the appearance of the surroundings and motion, considering the importance of context-motion interplay in identifying anomalies in complex scenes. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark datasets, including large-scale real-world datasets. We demonstrate the significance of relational information by analyzing qualitative results and showcasing the generalization ability of our method.
