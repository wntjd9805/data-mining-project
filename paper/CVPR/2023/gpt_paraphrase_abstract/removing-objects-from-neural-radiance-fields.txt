Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are widely used as a scene representation for generating novel views. However, before sharing a NeRF, it may be necessary to remove personal information or unwanted objects, which is currently challenging using existing NeRF editing frameworks. To address this, we propose a framework for object removal from a NeRF created from an RGB-D sequence. Our method is inspired by recent advancements in 2D image inpainting and utilizes a user-provided mask for guidance. We incorporate a confidence-based view selection procedure to ensure 3D consistency while choosing which inpainted images to include in the NeRF creation. Our approach produces plausible and coherent inpaintings, surpassing other methods in performance. We further validate our method by introducing a new and difficult dataset for NeRF inpainting.
