We present a novel technique for capturing 3D scans of unknown objects using a single camera. Our approach utilizes a neural implicit surface representation to capture both the object's geometry and appearance. Unlike previous methods that rely on known camera-object relative poses, we simultaneously optimize the object shape and pose trajectory. To overcome the challenges of direct optimization without coarse-level initialization, we propose an incremental approach that divides the sequence into overlapping segments. Within each segment, we reconstruct the object shape and track its poses independently before merging all segments for global optimization. Our method successfully reconstructs the shape and color of textured and texture-less objects, surpassing traditional methods that only rely on appearance features. Additionally, its performance is comparable to recent methods assuming known camera poses.
