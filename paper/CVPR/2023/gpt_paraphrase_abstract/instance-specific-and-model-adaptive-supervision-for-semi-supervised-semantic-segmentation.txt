Recently, there has been progress in semi-supervised semantic segmentation using a small amount of labeled data. However, current studies treat all unlabeled data equally and do not consider the differences and difficulties in training each instance. This paper introduces iMAS, a method that focuses on the importance of these differences and proposes instance-specific and model-adaptive supervision for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. iMAS evaluates the difficulty of each unlabeled instance using a class-weighted symmetric intersection-over-union metric, based on the model's performance. It then adjusts the training process by progressively weighting the consistency losses of unlabeled instances according to their evaluated difficulty. Additionally, iMAS dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance to match the model's generalization capability during training. Without the need for additional losses or training procedures, iMAS achieves significant performance improvements compared to current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks under different semi-supervised partition protocols.
