The lack of night image annotations makes object detection at night a difficult task. Despite attempts to use domain adaptation methods, achieving accurate results remains problematic. The use of the student-teacher framework often leads to false-positive error propagation, especially for small-scale and low-light objects. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-phase consistency unsupervised domain adaptation network called 2PCNet. In the first phase, the network incorporates high-confidence bounding-box predictions from the teacher and combines them with the student's region proposals. In the second phase, the teacher re-evaluates the combined predictions, resulting in a mix of high and low confidence pseudo-labels. To strengthen the pseudo-labels for small-scale objects, the night images and pseudo-labels are scaled-down before being used as input to the student. Additionally, a night-specific augmentation pipeline called NightAug is proposed to address errors caused by low-light regions and other night-related attributes in images. This pipeline applies random augmentations, such as glare, blur, and noise, to daytime images. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 20%, as well as supervised models trained directly on the target data.
