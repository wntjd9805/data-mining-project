Active domain adaptation (ADA) aims to improve the performance of model adaptation by incorporating active learning techniques to label a subset of target samples that are most informative. However, traditional active learning methods do not take into account the presence of domain shift, resulting in the failure to identify valuable samples for domain adaptation. To address this, we propose a collaborative framework that combines active learning and domain adaptation, emphasizing the importance of a customized learning strategy for the target data. We introduce a new ADA framework called Divide-and-Adapt (DiaNA), which categorizes target instances into four groups based on their transferable properties using a data subdivision protocol that considers uncertainty and domainness. This allows DiaNA to accurately identify the most beneficial samples for annotation. For the remaining categories, DiaNA employs tailored learning strategies. We also propose an informativeness score that unifies the criteria for data partitioning, enabling the use of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to automatically sample unlabeled data into the four categories. Thanks to its "divide-and-adapt" approach, DiaNA can handle data with significant variations in domain gap. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DiaNA is applicable to various domain adaptation settings, including unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), and source-free domain adaptation (SFDA).
