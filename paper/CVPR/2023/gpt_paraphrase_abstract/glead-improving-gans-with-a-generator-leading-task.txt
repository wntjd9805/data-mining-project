The abstract discusses the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) in which a generator (G) and a discriminator (D) compete against each other. The discriminator's role is to determine whether an image is real or generated by the generator. However, in the traditional GAN setup, the discriminator tends to have an advantage. To address this imbalance, the authors propose a new approach where the generator assigns a task to the discriminator as well. In this new paradigm, the discriminator is expected to extract representative features from an image that can be accurately reconstructed by the generator. Experimental results on various datasets show significant improvement compared to baseline methods. For example, the proposed approach improves the FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance) of StyleGAN2 on LSUN Bedroom from 4.30 to 2.55 and on LSUN Church from 4.04 to 2.82. The authors believe that their work can inspire the community to develop better generator-leading tasks for GAN improvement. The project page can be found at https://ezioby.github.io/glead/.
