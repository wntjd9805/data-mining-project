RGB-T tracking aims to improve the tracking process by utilizing the complementary nature of RGB and TIR modalities. Previous methods either directly concatenate the features of RGB and TIR search regions, resulting in background noise, or conduct fusion approaches on isolated pairs of RGB and TIR boxes, limiting context modeling. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Template-Bridged Search region Interaction (TBSI) module, which uses templates as a medium to facilitate cross-modal interaction between RGB and TIR search regions. Our TBSI module is integrated into a ViT backbone for joint feature extraction, search-template matching, and cross-modal interaction. Experimental results on three RGB-T tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/RyanHTR/TBSI. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between our approach and previous methods. In our approach, template tokens are used to bridge the cross-modal interaction between RGB and TIR search region tokens.
