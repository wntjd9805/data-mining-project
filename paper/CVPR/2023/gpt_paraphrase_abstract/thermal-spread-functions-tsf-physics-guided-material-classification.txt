We propose a material classification framework that utilizes the thermal properties of objects for robust and non-destructive classification. By heating the objects with a low-power laser and capturing measurements with a thermal camera during the heating and cooling process, we can determine the unique intrinsic properties of the material, such as emissivity and diffusivity. This information is then used to train a classifier that assigns a fine-grained material label to each spatial pixel. Our approach is simple, requiring only a low-power laser and a thermal camera, yet achieves accurate classification results with 86% accuracy over 16 classes.
