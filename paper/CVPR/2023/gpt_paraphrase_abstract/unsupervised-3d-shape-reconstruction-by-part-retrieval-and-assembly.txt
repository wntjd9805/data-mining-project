Decomposing 3D shapes using a set of primitives can enhance perception, facilitate robotic object manipulation, and enable various editing and compression techniques. However, existing methods using either parametric primitives or learned shape spaces have limitations. Parametric primitives result in coarse approximations, while learned parts offer limited control over decomposition. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that allows users to decompose shapes using a library of 3D parts, providing full control over part selection. This library can include high-quality geometry parts specific to a given category, leading to meaningful decompositions with clean geometry. Moreover, the type of decomposition can be controlled by choosing different parts from the library. Our unsupervised method iteratively retrieves parts from the library and refines their placements, resulting in higher reconstruction accuracy and more desirable decompositions compared to existing approaches. We also demonstrate how the decomposition can be controlled by using different part libraries to reconstruct the same shapes.
