Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a crucial technology in public safety and intelligent surveillance for detecting unexpected abnormal events in videos. However, current VAD methods primarily focus on semi-supervised learning, where only normal events are labeled in the training set. Existing datasets and algorithms do not adequately address scene-dependent anomalies, where an event may be normal in one scene but abnormal in another. Additionally, there is a lack of research on video anomaly anticipation, which aims to predict abnormal events before they occur. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale dataset, NWPU Campus, that includes scene-dependent anomalies and is suitable for studying anomaly anticipation. We also propose a novel method that combines anomaly detection and anticipation, and can handle scene-dependent anomalies. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our contributions include the development of a new dataset, NWPU Campus, the introduction of video anomaly anticipation as a research task, and the proposal of a novel method for detecting and anticipating anomalous events, including scene-dependent anomalies.
