This paper explores the use of visual metaphors in human communication, specifically in advertising. Visual metaphors are images that compare two seemingly unrelated concepts, conveying a metaphorical message to viewers. The paper classifies visual metaphors into four types: contextual metaphors, hybrid metaphors, juxtaposition, and multimodal metaphors. Understanding and generating visual metaphors pose challenges for computer vision, as existing techniques primarily focus on literal interpretation of images. The authors propose multiple tasks, such as classification, localization, understanding, and generation, to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of AI models in metaphor comprehension and generation. The authors introduce the MetaCLUE dataset, which includes metaphor annotations on images from the Pitt's Ads dataset. The paper evaluates state-of-the-art techniques on these tasks and discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the models. Despite some improvements with fine-tuning, the models struggle to produce satisfactory results, highlighting the difficulty of these tasks. The experiments provide a concrete first step towards further AI research on visual metaphors.
