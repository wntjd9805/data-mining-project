Generating digital replicas of real-world objects from image measurements is a challenging task in computer science. Traditional multi-view reconstruction approaches require multiple viewpoints to achieve full-surround coverage of the object. However, using a single camera, even if it is moving, may not be sufficient when dealing with dynamic objects with complex shapes and motions. While a multi-camera system can provide the necessary information, it is often prohibitively expensive and complex, especially for objects with complex appearance, geometry, and self-occlusions.In this paper, we propose a novel approach for full-surround 3D reconstruction of general dynamic objects using a kaleidoscope. A kaleidoscope, consisting of multiple interreflecting mirrors imaged by a camera, dramatically increases the number of viewpoints, enabling a virtual time-synchronized multi-view system. However, 3D reconstruction with a kaleidoscope requires solving the labeling problem, which involves identifying the specific sequence of mirrors encountered by light reaching each camera pixel.Existing techniques for solving the labeling problem, such as time-of-flight cameras or structured light systems, are not suitable for dynamic objects due to long scan times. Prior art with passive illumination constructs the visual hull of the object and uses it to estimate the label, but this two-stage process often produces erroneous results. Our proposed technique takes advantage of the nature of information encoded in a kaleidoscopic image. By treating a single pixel in a kaleidoscopic image as equivalent to multiple pixels in a multi-camera system, we develop a technique called kaleidoscopic space sculpting.Kaleidoscopic space sculpting sets up an optimization problem that updates a neural implicit surface using cost functions that encode background information and foreground regions, as well as the texture of the object. Interestingly, our technique does not explicitly calculate the label information but still provides robust single-shot full-surround 3D reconstructions. For dynamic objects, we apply our technique separately to each frame of a kaleidoscopic video to obtain full-surround 3D videos.Although our technique has limitations in terms of object size constraint, limited pixel count, and sensitivity to foreground-background masking, we demonstrate its effectiveness in generating accurate 3D replicas of real objects. Our proposed technique offers a new approach for 3D reconstruction using a single kaleidoscopic image, providing valuable insights for the computer vision and graphics community.
