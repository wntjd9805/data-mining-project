Hyperspectral images (HSIs) with tens to hundreds of bands hold discriminative information about materials, making them advantageous for various applications. However, HSIs suffer from low spatial resolution, making hyperspectral super-resolution (HSI-SR) a necessary pre-processing task. Fusion-based HSI-SR aims to estimate high-resolution HSIs (HR-HSIs) from low-resolution HSIs (LR-HSIs) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs). This paper proposes a coordination optimization framework for stable, interpretable, and lightweight HSI-SR. The framework integrates the Wald protocol to establish a positive feedback loop between the likelihood and the prior. An explicit degradation estimation method is developed to improve the stability and accuracy of the estimation. Additionally, a lightweight autoencoder is utilized to simulate the general spectral mixing prior in HSIs, achieving interpretability and reducing computational burden. The proposed method shows fast convergence and stable performance and has the advantage of explicit estimation and lightweight modeling compared to existing methods.
