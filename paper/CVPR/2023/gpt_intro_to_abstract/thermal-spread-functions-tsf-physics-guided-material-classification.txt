Material classification is a crucial task in various fields, including medicine, chip manufacturing, recycling, and vision and robotics. Different tools can be used for material classification, ranging from simple tools like infrared spectroscopy to more advanced tools like thermal imaging. The use of RGB images for classification is popular but lacks robustness, while spectrum-based imaging methods require complex optical systems. Human perception of materials often depends on multiple modalities, including touch and vision. Touching an object involves a thermodynamic exchange that relies on the material composition, which can provide valuable insights for classification. Previous work has explored haptic sensing and displays for material classification but can be invasive. Thermal imaging methods offer a contact-free and non-destructive way to estimate thermal properties for material classification. The laser flash method is commonly used for this purpose but is limited to constrained lab setups. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive thermal imaging system for material classification that is robust and can be used in uncontrolled environments. We use a visible laser beam as an external heat source and a thermal camera to capture the heating and cooling process. We define the temperature transients obtained from this process as the Thermal Spread Function (TSF) and use it for robust material classification. To overcome the emissivity ambiguity of thermal cameras, we leverage a physically accurate heat diffusion equation. Our approach involves deriving a model for TSFs, solving the inverse heat problem using Finite Differences Method, and designing a simple optical setup for non-invasive material classification based on thermodynamic properties.
