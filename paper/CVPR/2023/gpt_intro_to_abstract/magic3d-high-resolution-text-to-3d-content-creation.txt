This paper introduces Magic3D, a framework for synthesizing highly detailed 3D models from text prompts in reduced computation time. The existing methods for 3D content generation are limited due to the lack of diverse large-scale 3D datasets and inefficient architectures. Magic3D addresses these limitations by proposing a coarse-to-fine optimization approach that utilizes multiple diffusion priors at different resolutions. It optimizes both neural field and mesh representations to achieve view-consistent geometry and high-resolution details. The framework incorporates an efficient differentiable rasterizer for fast image rendering and allows for creative controls in the 3D synthesis process. Magic3D produces high-fidelity 3D content that can be easily imported and visualized in standard graphics software, exhibiting 2Ã— the speed of DreamFusion. The paper also extends image editing techniques to 3D object editing and demonstrates the applications of the proposed framework. Overall, Magic3D significantly improves the quality and efficiency of 3D content synthesis, bringing us closer to democratizing 3D content creation.
