This paper addresses the challenge of high-level or super-coarse-grained visual categorization, which has received little attention compared to basic-level categorization. The authors introduce the concept of superclasses, which are a handful of high-level categories where numerous images from diverse basic-level categories share a common label. They use the example of refuse sorting, where the goal is to accurately collect various items into different superclasses such as kitchen waste and recyclable waste. The authors highlight two key characteristics of superclasses: scattered basic-level classes and shared common features among instances from different superclasses. They argue that existing classification techniques based on smoothness assumption are not applicable to superclass identification. To tackle the superclass problems, the authors propose a SuperClass Learning framework with Representation Enhancement. They introduce a cross-instance attention module that captures representation across instances with the same superclass label and enhance this representation using contrastive adjustment loss. They also address the imbalance distribution of superclasses by adopting target adjustment loss to reconstruct a superclass-aware decision boundary. The contributions of this paper are threefold: 1) the proposal of a realistic problem, superclass identification, that has notable differences from basic-level categorization, 2) the introduction of a novel representation enhancement method using cross-instance attention, and 3) the demonstration of superior performance compared to state-of-the-art classification techniques on artificial and real datasets. The subsequent sections of the paper provide a review of related work, a description of the proposed method, experimental results, and a conclusion.
