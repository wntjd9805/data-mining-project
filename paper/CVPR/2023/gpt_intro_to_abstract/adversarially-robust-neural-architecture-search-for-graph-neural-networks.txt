Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for modeling relational data in various real-world applications. However, GNNs are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in risk-sensitive domains. Prior defense methods on graph data have been developed, but they rely on prior knowledge of the attacker and may fail to adapt to new scenarios or attack methods. Additionally, previous methods lack an architectural perspective in understanding GNN robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Robust Neural Architecture search framework for GNNs (G-RNA). G-RNA utilizes Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically search for optimal robust GNN architectures and fill the gap in understanding GNN robustness from an architectural perspective. We design a robust search space and a robustness metric to guide the search process. Experimental results demonstrate that G-RNA outperforms existing robust GNNs in defending against adversarial attacks. Our contributions include the development of a robust NAS framework for GNNs, a novel robust search space, and a robustness metric.
