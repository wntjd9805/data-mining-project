Panoramas are extensively used in various real-world applications, and the understanding of panoramas has gained significant attention in the research community. The equirectangular projection (ERP) is the most popular representation of panoramas but presents challenges due to the inherent omnidirectional vision. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable performance in planar image understanding, most CNN-based methods are not suitable for panoramas due to two fundamental problems: polar and side boundary discontinuity and spatial distortion caused by ERP. Several existing methods address these issues but suffer from high computation costs or are limited to panoramic images. In this paper, we propose the PanoSwin Transformer, inspired by the Swin Transformer, to reduce the distortion of panoramic images. To address the boundary discontinuity, we introduce a pano-style shift windowing scheme (PSW) that establishes side continuity through horizontal shift and polar continuity through rotation. To overcome spatial distortion, we apply pitch attention (PA) that allows windows to interact without distortion. Additionally, we leverage planar knowledge by designing PanoSwin to be compatible with both panoramic and planar images. We adopt a two-stage learning paradigm based on knowledge preservation, where PanoSwin is pretrained with planar images and then fine-tuned with a knowledge preservation loss and downstream task losses. Our contributions include the proposal of PanoSwin with PSW and PA modules, the compatibility with planar images, and the introduction of a KP-based two-stage learning paradigm. We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on panoramic object detection, classification, and layout estimation tasks on multiple datasets.
