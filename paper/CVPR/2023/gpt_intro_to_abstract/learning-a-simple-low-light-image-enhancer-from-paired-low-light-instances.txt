Low-light images often suffer from distortions such as low contrast, poor visibility, and sensor noise, making them unsuitable for information transmission and computer vision tasks. Low-light image enhancement (LIE) algorithms have been developed to correct these distortions. Histogram-based and Retinex-based approaches are two well-known techniques for LIE. Retinex-based methods have gained more attention due to their ability to model human color perceptions. Recently, learning-based LIE algorithms that rely on low-light and normal-light image pairs have been successful. However, collecting high-quality reference maps is time-consuming and expensive. Unsupervised and zero-shot LIE approaches have been proposed to eliminate the need for normal-light images, but they depend on handcrafted priors and struggle to produce high-quality results. To address these issues, we propose PairLIE, a novel learning-based LIE method that leverages paired low-light instances to train the network. The proposed method combines the Retinex theory with deep learning to decompose low-light images into illumination and reflectance components. By optimizing the image before applying the Retinex decomposition, our method improves estimation accuracy. With fewer handcrafted priors and a simpler network, PairLIE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
