Blind face restoration aims to restore high-quality face images from their low-quality counterparts suffering from unknown degradation. Various priors, such as geometric priors and reference priors, have been used to improve restoration quality. However, current methods lack robustness in handling degraded inputs and often produce undesired results with artifacts. This is due to the inconsistency between synthetic degradation used in training and the actual degradation in the real world. To address this, we propose a framework called DR2E that consists of a degradation removal module (DR2) and an enhancement module. DR2 leverages a pretrained diffusion model to remove degradation and achieve robustness against complex degradation. The enhancement module allows flexibility in incorporating different restoration methods for high-quality details. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heavily degraded datasets.
