The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the emergence of deep image prior (DIP) as a successful method for solving image restoration and visual inverse problems. DIP parameterizes a visual object using a structured deep neural network and is able to solve these problems without the need for additional training data. However, there are practical issues that hinder the deployment of DIP, namely overfitting and slowness. Overfitting is often mitigated through trial-and-error, but this approach is not scalable for large-scale batch processing or unfamiliar scenarios. Slowness is also a limitation, as the optimization process for DIP can be computationally expensive. To address these issues, the authors propose a modified approach called deep random projector (DRP) that achieves comparable performance to DIP but with significantly less computation time. DRP incorporates three modifications to DIP: optimizing the seed, reducing network depth, and including additional explicit regularization priors. The authors validate the effectiveness of DRP on several image restoration tasks and demonstrate that their proposed early stopping method can be directly integrated. Overall, DRP offers a complete solution to the overfitting and slowness issues associated with DIP.
