This paper addresses the problem of object detection in spherical images, which has received less attention compared to object detection in planar images. The authors highlight the challenges of using existing detection benchmarks and ln-norms loss for spherical image object detection, such as parameter optimization and inconsistency between metrics and loss. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a new regression loss function based on Gaussian Label Distribution Learning (GLDL) and a dynamic sample selection strategy called GLDL-ATSS. They show that the GLDL loss achieves a trend-level alignment with Spherical IoU (SphIoU) loss and improves the detection accuracy. The experimental results on two datasets validate the effectiveness of their approach.
