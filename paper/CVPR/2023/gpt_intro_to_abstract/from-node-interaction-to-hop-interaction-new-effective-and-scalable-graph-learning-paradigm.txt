Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity due to their success in various graph applications. The core mechanism of GNNs involves node interaction through message passing, which enables nodes to aggregate and update information from their neighbors. However, the scalability and over-smoothing limitations of GNNs hinder their application in large-scale settings. To address these limitations, scalable GNNs that simplify node interactions have been proposed but lack nonlinear interactions among nodes. Over-smoothing also affects the discriminative ability of nodes in heterophily graphs. Advanced node interaction GNNs have shown promise in addressing these issues but are computationally expensive and incapable of handling large-scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a new hop interaction paradigm, called HopGNN, which combines the low-latency, node-interaction-free nature of decoupled GNNs with the high discrimination ability of advanced node interaction GNNs. HopGNN preprocesses multi-hop features of each node and conducts non-linear interactions among hops. We design an attention-based interaction layer and average pooling for HopGNN and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on diverse graph datasets. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining scalability and efficiency.
