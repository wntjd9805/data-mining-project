This paper introduces the problem of commonsense lacking in vision-language (VL) models and proposes a novel training strategy called DANCE (Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capability). The authors identify the lack of commonsense knowledge in existing large-scale VL datasets as a key reason for the problem. To address this, they propose generating commonsense-augmented image-text pairs by leveraging knowledge graphs and hiding the names of entities in the images. The authors also propose a new diagnostic test set, Image-Text and Text-Image Retrieval, to evaluate the pre-trained VL models' commonsense abilities. They validate the effectiveness of DANCE using the diagnostic test set and a visual question answering benchmark. The paper concludes by summarizing the main findings and contributions, including the proposed training strategy, the new benchmark, and the experimental results.
