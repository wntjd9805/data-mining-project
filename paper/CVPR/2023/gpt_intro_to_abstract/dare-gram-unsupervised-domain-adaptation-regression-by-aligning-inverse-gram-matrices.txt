Regression problems, where models predict continuous variables, are widely encountered in various applications including computer vision tasks and industrial applications. However, real-world applications often face domain gaps between datasets due to environmental conditions and other factors. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to overcome this distributional shift between a labeled source domain and an unlabeled target domain. While many UDA methods have been proposed for classification and segmentation problems, regression problems have received less attention. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Domain Adaptation Regression by aligning the inverse GRAM matrices (DARE-GRAM) to address the UDA regression problem. Unlike previous methods that align the features directly, we align the inverse Gram matrix of the features based on its presence in the closed-form solution of the ordinary least squares. This alignment leads to a better-calibrated regressor for both source and target data. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DARE-GRAM compared to baseline methods.
