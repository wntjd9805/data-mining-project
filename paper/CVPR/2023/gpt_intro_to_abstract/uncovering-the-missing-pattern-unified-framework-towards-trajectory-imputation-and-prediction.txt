Modeling and predicting future trajectories is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving, motion capture, and behavior understanding. However, accurately predicting movement patterns is challenging due to their complex and subtle nature. Existing methods often assume complete agent observations, which is unrealistic in practical scenarios. This problem is evident in sports games and autonomous driving, where occlusion or sensor failure can cause missing data. Most existing approaches in time series imputation focus on autoregressive models but lack the consideration of interacting entities and long-range temporal modeling. Furthermore, the relevance between trajectory imputation and prediction tasks is often overlooked. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called the Graph-based Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network (GC-VRNN) that simultaneously handles trajectory imputation and prediction. Our framework incorporates a Multi-Space Graph Neural Network (MS-GNN) to extract spatial features of incomplete observations and a Conditional VRNN (C-VRNN) with a Temporal Decay (TD) module to model temporal dependencies and learn missing patterns. By sharing information between the two tasks, our approach improves the performance of both trajectory imputation and prediction. We also introduce three practical datasets, Basketball-TIP, Football-TIP, and Vehicle-TIP, for joint evaluation and provide strong baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of our method.
