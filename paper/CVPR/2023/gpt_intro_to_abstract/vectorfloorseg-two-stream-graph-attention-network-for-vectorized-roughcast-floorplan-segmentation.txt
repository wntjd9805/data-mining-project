Vector graphics are extensively used in various industries such as graphic design, 2D interfaces, and floor plans. Among these, 2D floor plans consisting of geometric primitives are commonly used in interior design, construction, and property development. Unlike raster images, vector graphics can be scaled without any loss in quality. However, applying image-based backbone networks directly to vector graphics is challenging due to the irregular structure of the data. Semantic segmentation of roughcast floor plans, which involves labeling different types of rooms, is a crucial task for downstream applications. Existing methods typically use image-based segmentation networks on rasterized floor plans, but their results often have inaccurate boundaries and fragmented regions. Moreover, these methods rely on additional information such as texts and furniture, which are not available in roughcast floor plans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation of vector roughcast floor plans. Our approach leverages the dual aspects of boundary line classification and region classification. We design a two-stream graph neural network that processes the primal lines and dual regions separately. Additionally, we introduce a modulated graph attention layer to exchange data between the two streams. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale floor plan datasets and demonstrate that our results outperform previous image-based methods in terms of compactness and integrity. Our contributions include the dual approach to semantic segmentation, the design of two-stream graph neural networks, a novel modulated graph attention layer, and a new metric to assess segmentation accuracy and integrity.
