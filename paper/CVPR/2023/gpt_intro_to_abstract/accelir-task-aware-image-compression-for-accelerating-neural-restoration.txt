Image restoration (IR) techniques are used to recover high-quality images from lower-quality counterparts, such as super-resolution, de-noising, and de-blurring. With the advancement of deep learning, IR has been widely used in various applications including satellite/medical image enhancement, facial recognition, and video streaming/analytics. However, as the resolution of images used in these applications increases, the computing and memory overheads of deep neural networks (DNNs) used for IR also increase. Previous approaches have addressed this issue by designing efficient feature extraction or up-scaling layers, adjusting network complexities according to IR difficulty, or pruning network parameters. However, these approaches do not consider the impact of image compression on IR quality, despite the fact that real-world images are commonly saved in a compressed format. In this paper, we propose AccelIR, the first IR-aware image compression framework that optimizes compression levels based on the impact on IR quality. AccelIR aims to reduce computation while maintaining the same IR quality and image size. It operates in two phases: offline profiling and online compression. In the offline phase, AccelIR clusters image blocks and constructs profiles that describe the impact of compression on IR quality and image size. It also trains a lightweight CNN to guide the selection of the best-fit group for unseen image blocks. In the online phase, AccelIR retrieves the profiles for each block within an image and selects the optimal compression level for each block using the block-level profiles. Evaluation of AccelIR using JPEG and WebP image compression standards shows significant improvements in super-resolution, de-noising, and de-blurring tasks compared to applying IR to images encoded by the standard codecs. AccelIR reduces computing cost by 35-74%, 24-34%, and 24-34% for super-resolution, de-noising, and de-blurring, respectively, while maintaining the same IR quality and image size. Additionally, AccelIR can support any image codec and can be easily integrated into existing IR applications.
