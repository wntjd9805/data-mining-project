3D garment animation has various applications in fields such as 3D content generation, virtual try-on, digital humans, and video games. The existing pipeline for 3D garment animation relies on physics-based simulation, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for high-quality methods. Data-driven or learning-based methods have been proposed as alternatives, but many of them only work well with tight garments like T-shirts and pants and struggle with loose-fitting garments such as dresses and skirts. These methods often attach garment templates to the human body skeleton, resulting in discontinuities in the deformed garment mesh. Some methods address this issue by smoothing out blend weights, but this can lead to a loss of shape details for large deformations of loose-fitting garments. In this paper, we propose an anchor-based deformation model called AnchorDEF for predicting 3D garment deformation from a body motion sequence. Our approach uses a mixture of rigid anchor transformations to detach the garment articulation from the body skeleton while preserving the body movement prior. This allows us to easily regress nonlinear displacements in a canonical space. We demonstrate that our method can realistically deform loose-fitting garments, such as dresses, by leveraging anchor transformations. Specifically, we estimate rigid transformations of a set of anchors based on a sequence of body motions. Using linear blending skinning, we deform the garment mesh template by combining the anchor transformations and regress per-vertex displacements to correct any artifacts. To ensure better generalization and reduce garment-body interpenetrations, we enforce the transformed anchors to maintain consistency with position and normal. We also employ a relative direction constraint to further reduce interpenetrations. To optimize the anchor position and make them representative of the garment deformation, we introduce an adaptive anchor updating approach that uses mesh simplification as supervision. This parameterizes the anchor position using a local attention mask and pushes the anchors towards folds and boundaries of the garment mesh.The main contributions of this work are: (1) the proposal of an anchor-based deformation model for representing the deformation of 3D garments, especially loose-fitting ones, (2) the incorporation of position and normal consistencies and a relative direction constraint to learn anchor transformations with better generalization and fewer interpenetrations, and (3) the introduction of an adaptive anchor updating approach using mesh simplification as supervision to optimize the anchor position for learning representative transformations.
