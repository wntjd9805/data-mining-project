This paper introduces the problem of point cloud sequence interpolation and proposes a novel algorithm called NeuralPCI to address it. Existing methods for point cloud interpolation are limited to linear motion assumptions and do not effectively capture the complex nonlinear motions present in real-world scenarios. The authors draw inspiration from video frame interpolation methods and propose a 4D spatio-temporal neural field that takes sequential 3D point clouds and interpolation time as input to predict the in-between or future point cloud. NeuralPCI is optimized in a self-supervised manner, making it free from the out-of-distribution generalization problem. The algorithm is evaluated on both indoor and outdoor datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of a novel interpolation algorithm, the introduction of a 4D spatio-temporal neural field, and a flexible framework for interpolation and extrapolation tasks.
