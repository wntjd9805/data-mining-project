The paper introduces the problem of cross-domain 3D object detection (3DOD) in LiDAR-based 3DOD models. It highlights the importance of generalizing well-trained 3DOD models to different point cloud datasets and discusses its significance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving. The paper investigates the use of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) techniques to address the performance gap between UDA-based models and fully-supervised ones. The authors propose a Bi-domain active learning (Bi3D) framework that leverages active sampling strategies for effective 3D scene-level cross-domain object detection. The Bi3D framework includes a domainness-aware source sampling strategy and a diversity-based target sampling strategy to select informative samples from both source and target domains. Experimental results show that Bi3D outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods with only 1% target annotation budget, achieving high performance in cross-domain 3DOD tasks.
