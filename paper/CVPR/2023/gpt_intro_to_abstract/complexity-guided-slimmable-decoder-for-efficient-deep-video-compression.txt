Recently, learning-based video codecs have shown promising coding performance compared to commercial codecs like H.264 and H.265. However, these codecs are computationally complex, making them inefficient for real-time video decoding. Additionally, different devices may have varying computational capabilities, requiring a video decoder that can support multiple computational complexities. In this paper, we propose a complexity-guided slimmable decoder (cgSlimDecoder) combined with skip-adaptive entropy coding (SaEC) for efficient deep video coding. The cgSlimDecoder automatically selects the optimal channel widths for different modules based on complexity constraints, allowing for efficient allocation of computational resources. The SaEC method enables more efficient entropy coding by predicting elements that can be precisely predicted by the hyperprior networks and directly using their mean values. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in improving decoding efficiency without sacrificing rate-distortion performance. Our contributions include the proposal of a complexity-guided slimmable decoder, the development of the SaEC coding method, and the general applicability of our methods to existing video compression methods.
