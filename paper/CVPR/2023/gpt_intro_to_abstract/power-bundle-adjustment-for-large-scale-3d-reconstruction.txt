Bundle adjustment (BA) is a fundamental problem in computer vision that is essential for 3D reconstruction and Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms. It involves estimating camera parameters and 3D landmark positions by minimizing a non-linear reprojection error. With the rise of large-scale internet photo collections, there is a growing demand for BA methods that are scalable in terms of runtime and memory. Additionally, the need to build accurate city-scale maps for applications like augmented reality and autonomous driving pushes current BA approaches to their limits.The most time-consuming step in BA is solving the normal equation, so the Schur complement trick is commonly used to form the reduced camera system (RCS). This linear system only involves the pose parameters and is much smaller in size. Further reduction can be achieved by using a QR factorization to derive a matrix square root of the RCS and then solving the corresponding algebraically equivalent problem.In this paper, we propose a novel solver called Power Bundle Adjustment (PoBA) for efficient large-scale BA. PoBA introduces inverse expansion methods, challenging existing techniques that rely on iterative and direct solvers. We establish a link between the bundle adjustment problem and the theory of power series, providing theoretical proofs that support our expansion approach and demonstrate the convergence of our solver.To evaluate the effectiveness of PoBA, extensive experiments are conducted on the BAL dataset, comparing it with various state-of-the-art solvers. Our results highlight the benefits of PoBA in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory consumption. Furthermore, we integrate our solver into a distributed BA framework, demonstrating significant improvements in speed and accuracy.To facilitate further research, we release PoBA as an open-source tool, which can be accessed at https://github.com/simonwebertum/poba. Overall, our work presents an innovative approach to large-scale BA and contributes to the advancement of computer vision and 3D reconstruction techniques.
