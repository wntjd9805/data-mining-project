The monitoring of man-made impacts or activities on the Earth's surface is crucial for designing interventions that can increase welfare and resilience in societies. One area where this monitoring is particularly important is agriculture, as tracking crop development can help design strategies to improve the welfare of farmers and enhance the resilience of the food production system. The second goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to end hunger, and achieving this goal relies on increasing crop productivity and revenues for farmers in poor and developing countries. Accurately monitoring yields and the evolution of cultivated areas is therefore essential for measuring progress towards achieving multiple goals and evaluating the effectiveness of different policies or interventions.In the European Union, the Sentinel for Common Agricultural Policy program (Sen4CAP) focuses on developing tools and analytics to support the verification of direct payments to farmers based on environmental conditionalities. Real-time monitoring using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel satellite constellation is used to complement on-site verification. The availability of space-borne Earth Observation (EO) data and advancements in machine learning for computer vision present an opportunity for the development of automated tools for crop development monitoring.To improve the accuracy of automatic crop type recognition, a fully-attentional architecture called TSViT is introduced. This architecture combines the Transformer backbone with the ViT framework, providing global receptive fields in time and space. A tokenization scheme and acquisition-time-specific temporal position encodings are proposed to extract date-aware features and account for irregularities in the acquisition times of the satellite imagery. Custom decoder heads are designed to accommodate both global and dense predictions for the problem at hand.Extensive ablation studies on design parameters are conducted to test the provided intuitions, and the TSViT architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification and semantic segmentation tasks across multiple publicly available datasets. This research contributes to the development of tools for automated monitoring of crop development, which plays a crucial role in achieving SDG 2 goals and enhancing the welfare and resilience of societies.
