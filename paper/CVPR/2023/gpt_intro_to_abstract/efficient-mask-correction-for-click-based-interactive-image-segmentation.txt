Interactive image segmentation is an important task in computer vision, with applications in various fields such as semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and medical image analysis. Traditional manual annotation of images for segmentation tasks is time-consuming and costly, making interactive segmentation methods an attractive alternative. Different interactive strategies have been studied, including bounding boxes, clicks, scribbles, and extreme points. Among these strategies, click-based methods have gained attention due to their simplicity and established training and evaluation protocols.Efficiency is crucial in interactive segmentation methods, as multiple iterations are typically required for a segmentation process. Deep learning-based interactive segmentation methods have shown improved performance compared to traditional methods, but some approaches require inference-time optimization, which increases computational cost. To address this, a recent work called RITM proposes different designs for interactive segmentation and achieves state-of-the-art results using a classic segmentation network.In this paper, we propose an efficient click-based interactive segmentation model called EMC-Click, which combines a base segmentation network with a lightweight mask correction network. The base network takes the first click as input and generates target-aware features and a coarse prediction. The mask correction network iteratively updates the prediction with each new click. Our model aims to strike a balance between performance and efficiency by using a decoupled design that reduces computational cost after the first click.To improve segmentation accuracy, we propose two feature augmentation modules: a click-guided self-attention module and a click-guided correlation module. The self-attention module propagates information from template features to other pixels, while the correlation module directly learns target contours. These modules effectively exploit click information and enhance segmentation performance. Experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and higher efficiency compared to state-of-the-art click-based interactive segmentation methods.Overall, our contribution includes the development of an efficient click-based interactive segmentation model, EMC-Click, which incorporates a lightweight mask correction network and feature augmentation modules. We evaluate our model on various benchmarks and show its superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
