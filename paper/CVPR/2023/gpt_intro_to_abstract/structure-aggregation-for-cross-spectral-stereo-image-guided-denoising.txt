Image denoising is a challenging task due to the problem of over-smoothing edges and details, particularly at high noise levels. In recent years, multi-modal image processing has gained attention for its potential to recover salient structures using a guidance image. However, current methods assume pixel-level alignment between the target and guidance images, which limits their applicability to unaligned cross-spectral images. This paper proposes a guided denoising framework for cross-spectral stereo image pairs. Instead of relying on pixel-level registration, a structure aggregation module is used to estimate a structure map for the target image based on non-local information from the guidance image. This structure map is then used by a guided denoising module to regress the final denoising result. The proposed method, called SANet, is trained without requiring ground-truth disparity information and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods on various datasets. Furthermore, the structure aggregation strategy shows potential for handling other unaligned guided restoration tasks such as super-resolution and deblurring.
