Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have gained popularity as a representation for generating novel views of 3D scenes. However, the specialized rendering algorithms required by NeRF pose a barrier to its wider adoption. Recent work has attempted to address this issue by using sparse 3D voxel grids, but they still rely on ray marching and cannot fully utilize the parallelism of GPUs. In this paper, we introduce MobileNeRF, a NeRF that can run on common mobile devices at interactive frame rates. MobileNeRF represents the scene using textured polygons and utilizes the classic polygon rasterization pipeline with Z-buffering for rendering. This approach is 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art method (SNeRG), consumes less memory, runs on web browsers, and allows real-time manipulation of reconstructed objects/scenes. These contributions make MobileNeRF a practical and efficient solution for NeRF visualization on various devices.
