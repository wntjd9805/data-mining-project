This paper addresses the challenges of fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) by proposing a novel approach to jointly train an erudite FGVC model using multiple datasets. The current approach requires a two-stage process of coarse-grained visual classification followed by fine-grained visual classification, which leads to longer inference time, more storage space requirements, and errors accumulation. The proposed approach aims to overcome these challenges through the use of a feature disentanglement and feature re-fusion module to balance the positive and negative transfer between datasets. Additionally, a meta-learning based spatial attention layer is introduced to enhance the model's localisation ability. The framework is evaluated on 11 mixed-datasets, resulting in state-of-the-art performance when combined with existing FGVC methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving accurate fine-grained label recognition across different coarse-grained label spaces.
