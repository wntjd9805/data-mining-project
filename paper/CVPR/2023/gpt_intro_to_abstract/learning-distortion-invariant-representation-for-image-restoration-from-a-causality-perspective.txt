Image restoration tasks in computer vision, such as image super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, and compression artifact removal, have shown impressive results with the use of deep learning. However, these deep learning models often suffer from a drop in performance when they encounter unseen degradation types or degrees. Empirical risk minimization (ERM), the commonly-used training paradigm for image restoration, fails to effectively handle out-of-distribution degradations. In this paper, we propose a novel training paradigm called Distortion Invariant representation Learning (DIL) for image restoration. DIL aims to improve the generalization capability of restoration networks by learning distortion-invariant representations based on causality. We introduce a structural causal graph and implement the back-door criterion to remove confounding effects caused by specific degradation types. We also address the challenge of constructing confounder sets and propose counterfactual distortion augmentation as a solution. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy based on meta-learning to eliminate the confounding effects and instantiate causal learning in image restoration. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DIL in improving the generalization ability of restoration networks on unseen distortion types and degrees.
