Flash is an essential tool in photography, but casual photographers often lack control over flash characteristics such as strength and color temperature. This limitation, combined with hardware constraints and the typical use case of flash, makes computational control of flash desirable. In this paper, we tackle the problems of flash illumination decomposition and generation. We model flash photograph formation using the superposition of flash and ambient illuminations. By decomposing the flash and ambient illuminations, we can computationally control the flash post-capture and generate flash light for a no-flash photograph. We use intrinsic image decomposition to separate the effects of lighting from surface properties. We develop a system for flash decomposition and show that our physically-inspired modeling allows us to generate high-quality decomposition results. Flash decomposition is an under-constrained problem, and flash generation is even more challenging. However, we formulate a self-supervision strategy using the cyclic relationship between decomposition and generation, and with a combined supervised and self-supervised strategy, we successfully simulate flash photographs from no-flash input.
