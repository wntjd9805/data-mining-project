Trajectory prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving and industrial robotics, aiming to predict the future trajectories of target agents based on past trajectories and road conditions. Previous methods have primarily focused on Single-agent Trajectory Prediction (STP), which uses past trajectories of other agents and road conditions as additional cues. However, the application of STP is limited as it cannot simultaneously process all traffic participants, which is necessary for safe autonomous driving. To address this, some methods propose utilizing STP on each agent separately and then combining the predictions using pairwise collision detection. However, this approach becomes infeasible with a large number of agents due to the exponentially growing search space for collision-free trajectories. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel movement-based method called Incremental PCC (IPCC) that models the interactions among multiple agents during driving by explicitly interpreting the physical meanings of individual variances and Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC) inside the covariance matrix. IPCC-TP, a module for Multi-agent Trajectory Prediction (MTP), is proposed based on IPCC, which can be easily embedded into existing methods to improve their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that methods enhanced with IPCC-TP outperform the original methods and become the new state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this work are the introduction of IPCC, a method that reveals the physical meaning of pairwise motion relevance and reduces memory cost, the development of IPCC-TP for modeling future interactions among multiple agents, and the demonstration of its effectiveness through improved trajectory prediction performance.
