In this paper, we address the challenge of learning geometry-aware representations in a compact way that can be useful for various downstream tasks in computer vision. Previous approaches have focused on capturing geometric features using methods such as handcrafted feature extraction, segmentation maps, or convolution features. However, these methods often lack compactness and struggle to prioritize important geometric information. Another line of work focuses on preserving geometric structure or disentangling factors in the data, but they often struggle to generalize to other domains.To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Learning by Sketching (LBS), which leverages the idea of sketching as a means to represent images while preserving their geometry. Sketching involves converting the salient features of an image into a set of color-coded strokes that accurately reflect geometric information. By representing sketches as a set of parameters, we can capture local geometric information and maintain the overall geometric structure of the image.We validate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretical analysis and present LBS as a method for generating abstract sketches coherent with the geometry of an input image. Unlike existing sketch generation methods, LBS does not require a sketch dataset for training and instead learns to convert an image into colored BÃ©zier curves that represent the geometric concepts of the image. We utilize perceptual loss based on the CLIP model to teach the style of sketching and propose a progressive optimization process for generating abstract sketches in a single inference step.To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experimental analyses on various downstream tasks, including describing relationships between geometric primitives, demonstrating spatial reasoning ability, containing general geometric information across domains, and improving performance on the FG-SBIR task. We show that LBS produces highly explainable representations through sketches and outperforms existing methods in capturing and preserving important geometric information.In conclusion, our paper presents a novel approach for learning geometry-aware representations using sketching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations, highlighting its potential for various computer vision tasks.
