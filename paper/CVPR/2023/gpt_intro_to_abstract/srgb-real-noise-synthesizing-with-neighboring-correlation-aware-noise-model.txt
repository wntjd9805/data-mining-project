Real image denoising is a challenging task in low-level computer vision. Deep denoisers trained on synthetic noise perform poorly on real photography, creating a need for more realistic noise models. Two approaches to real noise modeling are explored: raw-RGB and standard RGB (sRGB) domains. While raw-RGB images offer promising performance, they are not commonly used due to their large sizes. In contrast, most commercial cameras generate sRGB images by default. However, noise generation methods in the raw-RGB domain cannot be directly applied to sRGB images due to complicated noise distribution caused by the in-camera signal processing pipeline. Existing methods for sRGB noise modeling either require raw-RGB images or fail to explicitly model the characteristics of sRGB real noise. In this paper, a novel real noise generation network called Neighboring Correlation-Aware (NeCA) is proposed to synthesize real noise in the sRGB domain. NeCA assumes that sRGB real noise is signal-dependent and highly correlated with neighboring noise realizations, bridging the gap between synthetic and real noise in sRGB. By using the synthetic "real" images generated by NeCA, supervised deep denoisers achieve state-of-the-art performance in real image denoising, even with limited training data. The contributions of this work include the introduction of the neighboring correlation-aware noise model for sRGB real noise synthesis, a well-generalized framework for improved real image denoising, and the achievement of state-of-the-art denoising performance compared to other deep denoisers trained on different real noise models.
