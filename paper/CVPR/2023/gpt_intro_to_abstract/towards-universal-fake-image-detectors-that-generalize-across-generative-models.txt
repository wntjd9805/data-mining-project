The digital world is experiencing a rise in fake images, both those modified using tools like Adobe Photoshop and those generated through machine learning algorithms. The latter, generated by deep generative models, have gained attention for their high-quality output. However, these fake images also raise concerns about their potential misuse. Additionally, there is not just one source of fake images, as they can be generated using various generative model types. This paper aims to develop a general-purpose method for detecting fake images by training a model on one type of generative model and testing its ability to detect fake images from other types of generative models. Previous approaches have framed fake image detection as a learning-based problem, training deep networks on a dataset of fake and real images. However, these methods have not thoroughly explored the generalizability across different families of generative models. The authors find that existing methods primarily rely on identifying low-level fingerprints specific to the generative model used for training. As a result, the classifier fails to detect fake images from other generative models. To address this limitation, the authors propose using features that are not trained to separate fake from real images, specifically the fixed feature space of a CLIP-ViT model pre-trained on image-text pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the generalization ability in detecting fake images, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. The authors also investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of the feature space and find that the image encoder needs to be trained on internet-scale data. In summary, this paper analyzes the limitations of existing methods, presents a theory to explain these limitations, and proposes two simple baselines for real/fake image detection that achieve state-of-the-art performance. The key contributions include the analysis of existing methods, the proposed approach using CLIP-ViT features, and the study of the necessary ingredients for good generalizability.
