The paper introduces FlexNeRF, a novel approach for photorealistic free-viewpoint rendering of moving humans captured from monocular video, especially with sparse views. Previous approaches such as HumanNeRF utilize a pose prior and canonical configuration for optimization, which may not align with observed poses. FlexNeRF selects a pose from the available set of poses as the canonical pose-configuration, enabling easier learning of the motion field mapping. Additionally, FlexNeRF introduces pose-independent temporal deformation and cyclic-consistency loss to enhance the learning process. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods, especially in the case of sparse views.
