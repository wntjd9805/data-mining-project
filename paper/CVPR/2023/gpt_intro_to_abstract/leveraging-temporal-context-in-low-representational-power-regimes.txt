This paper discusses the challenge of boosting the performance of small computer vision models due to limited computational resources. The authors propose a solution by supplementing these models with an explicit representation of statistical regularities in the target domain during training. They introduce the Event Transition Matrix (ETM), which captures the likelihood of event transitions in real-world videos. The ETM is constructed based on action labels from a dataset, and it provides additional information for the models without the need for learning. The authors conduct experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the ETM into training for low-parameter models. They show that leveraging the ETM improves action recognition and anticipation, with the highest impact observed on smaller models. Overall, this work presents a potential approach for enhancing the efficiency of computer vision models by incorporating explicit representations of regularities during training.
