This paper introduces the problem of RGBD aerial tracking in the overhead space (2-5 meters above the ground), focusing on saving ground space and including more generic objects. The authors propose a novel RGBD aerial platform to collect videos and create a large-scale dataset for drone-based RGBD aerial tracking. They also present an efficient tracker, EMT, which achieves real-time performance on limited computational resources. The contributions of this work include defining a new task, constructing a diverse benchmark dataset, and providing a baseline tracker for efficient on-board multimodal tracking. The results show competitive tracking performance and promising balance of accuracy, resources, and speed.
