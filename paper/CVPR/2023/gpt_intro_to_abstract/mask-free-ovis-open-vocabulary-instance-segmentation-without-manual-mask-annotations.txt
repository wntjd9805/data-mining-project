Instance segmentation is a challenging task in computer vision that involves detecting and segmenting objects at the pixel level in an image. While deep neural networks have improved the state-of-the-art performance in instance segmentation, these methods are still limited by the need for manually annotated masks for each object category, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Existing methods also struggle to scale up to a large number of categories due to the intensive labor involved. Open-Vocabulary (OV) methods have emerged as a promising approach for segmenting novel categories beyond the base categories, but they still rely on manually annotated base categories for improved performance on novel categories. However, we have observed that fully-supervised information leads to overfitting to the base categories and hampers the performance on novel categories. In this paper, we propose a Mask-free Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation (OVIS) pipeline that eliminates the need for manual mask annotations and instead leverages weak supervision from image-level annotations and a pre-trained vision-language model to generate pseudo-mask annotations. Our experiments show that our method outperforms recent methods trained with manual masks on the MS-COCO and OpenImages datasets for both detection and instance segmentation tasks. Our contributions include the development of a mask-free pipeline for generating pseudo-mask annotations and the use of weakly supervised techniques for pseudo-mask generation, leading to state-of-the-art performance in instance segmentation tasks.
