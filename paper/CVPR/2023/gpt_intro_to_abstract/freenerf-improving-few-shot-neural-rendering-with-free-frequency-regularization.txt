Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has become popular in 3D computer vision and computer graphics for its ability to render high-quality novel views. However, NeRF struggles with synthesizing novel views when only a few inputs are available, a problem referred to as few-shot neural rendering. Existing methods address this challenge using strategies such as transfer learning, depth supervision, and patch-based regularization. In this work, we propose a plain NeRF approach that performs surprisingly well in the few-shot setting by adding minimal code modifications. We analyze the failure modes of training NeRF under low-data conditions and propose two regularization terms: frequency regularization and occlusion regularization. Our method, called Frequency regularized NeRF (FreeNeRF), does not require costly pre-training or extra supervisory signals, and it does not incur additional computation overhead. Despite its simplicity, FreeNeRF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets with minimal additional computation cost. Our contributions include revealing the link between few-shot neural rendering failure and frequency encoding, addressing this issue from a frequency perspective, identifying a common failure pattern and mitigating it with a new occlusion regularizer, and introducing a practical and efficient solution to the few-shot neural rendering problem. We hope that our observations and discussions will inspire further exploration of the role of frequency in NeRF's positional encoding.
