Massive datasets have fueled advancements in AI, particularly in areas like natural language processing and computer vision. However, there is a lack of large-scale datasets for 3D assets, limiting progress in 3D generative modeling, 2D vision tasks, and training embodied agents. In this paper, we introduce OBJAVERSE 1.0, a comprehensive corpus of over 800K high-quality, annotated 3D objects from diverse sources. We demonstrate the potential impact of OBJAVERSE in three research areas. Firstly, we show that OBJAVERSE can improve the quality and diversity of generated objects in 3D generative modeling. Secondly, we utilize the dataset to enhance the performance of long tail instance segmentation models by increasing data volume. Lastly, we leverage OBJAVERSE to build a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of visual classification models to perspective shifts. Additionally, we demonstrate how OBJAVERSE can significantly expand the asset library for training embodied agents, enabling open-vocabulary object navigation. We anticipate that OBJAVERSE will stimulate rapid progress in 2D and 3D computer vision research and beyond.
