This paper introduces a semantic-driven image-based editing approach for neural radiance field (NeRF) in real-world scenes, called SINE. The existing 3D editing methods are limited in terms of laborious annotation requirements, global style transfer, and difficulty in conducting texture editing on objects with photo-realistic textures. To address these limitations, SINE allows users to edit a neural radiance field with a single image and delivers edited novel views with consistent semantic meaning. Unlike previous methods, SINE learns a prior-guided editing field that encodes geometric and texture changes, enabling fine-grained editing ability. The paper proposes techniques such as cyclic constraints with a proxy mesh, color compositing mechanism, and feature-cluster-based regularization to enhance the editing process and control the affected areas. Experimental results demonstrate the superior editing capabilities and quality of SINE in real-world and synthetic scenes, making editing operations effortless.
