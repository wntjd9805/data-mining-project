This paper focuses on the problem of image-to-image translation in computer vision, such as domain adaptation, super-resolution, and medical image analysis. The goal is to find the true conditional distribution between two domains without pair information. The authors propose a shortest path assumption, where the optimal mapping generates the shortest path between the two domains. They introduce a shared generating assumption to synthesize images along the path and minimize the path length using finite difference method. The contributions of this paper include the proposed shortest path assumption, a simple and efficient way to synthesize images on the path, and the fastest method among all unpaired image translation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
