Video frame interpolation (VFI) is a widely used technique in video processing to enhance temporal resolution by generating intermediate frames. It has been applied to various tasks such as slow-motion generation, novel view synthesis, and video compression. Flow-based VFI methods have been dominant in previous research but suffer from the inaccurate estimation of intermediate flows. This paper introduces a new network architecture called All-pairs Multi-field Transforms (AMT) to address these issues. AMT incorporates all-pairs correlation to model dense correspondence between frames, particularly for large motions, and uses bidirectional correlation volumes for accurate flow estimation. Additionally, AMT generates multiple groups of fine-grained flow fields to handle occlusions, providing diverse solutions for interpolation. Experimental results demonstrate that AMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and efficiency across different model scales. The proposed convolution-based AMT achieves comparable performance to a transformer-based method with significantly lower computational cost. This work presents a promising approach to efficient frame interpolation and opens new possibilities for architecture design in this field.
