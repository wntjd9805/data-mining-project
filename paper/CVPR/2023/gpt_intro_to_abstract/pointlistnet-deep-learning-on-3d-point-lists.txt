This paper introduces the concept of deep learning and its application in modeling various data structures, such as texts, images, and 3D point clouds/sets. While previous deep neural networks have been successful in capturing the structure of these data types, there is a need for a network that can effectively capture the irregular structure of 3D point sets. To address this, the authors propose a Transformer-style network called PointListNet. PointListNet uses a non-parametric distance-based attention mechanism and integrates relative structure modeling to capture both sequence and geometry structures. The proposed method is evaluated on protein fold classification and enzyme reaction classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. The contributions of this paper include investigating point cloud methods for protein modeling, introducing PointListNet for 3D point list modeling, replacing non-parametric self-attention with distance-based attention, integrating relative structure modeling into the Transformer, and conducting extensive experiments to validate the proposed method.
