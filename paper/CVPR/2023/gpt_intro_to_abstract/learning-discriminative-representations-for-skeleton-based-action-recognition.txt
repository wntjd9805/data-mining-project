The ability for intelligent machines to understand human behaviors is crucial for natural human-computer interaction and various practical applications. With advancements in sensor technology and human pose estimation algorithms, obtaining 2D/3D skeletons of humans has become easier. Skeletons provide compact and robust representations that are ideal for action recognition. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely used to extract topological features from skeletons. However, using skeletons alone for action recognition has limitations, as important interactive objects and contextual information are lacking. This paper proposes a feature refinement module using contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative ability of features between ambiguous actions. The module decouples hidden features into spatial and temporal components and identifies confident and ambiguous samples based on model predictions during training. ConÔ¨Ådent samples are used to maintain a prototype for each class, achieved through contrastive learning, while ambiguous samples are calibrated in the feature space. The proposed module can be embedded into various GCN-based models for hierarchical feature learning. The paper's contributions include the proposal of the discriminative feature refinement module, its compatibility with most GCN-based models, and extensive experiments demonstrating significant improvements in action recognition on different datasets.
