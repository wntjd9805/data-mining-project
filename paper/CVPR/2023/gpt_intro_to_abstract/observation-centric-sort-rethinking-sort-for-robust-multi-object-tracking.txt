In this paper, we propose a motion model-based multi-object tracking (MOT) method called Observation-Centric SORT (OC-SORT) that addresses the limitations of existing motion model-based algorithms. Most current algorithms assume linear motion and suffer from errors when occlusion and non-linear motion occur simultaneously. To mitigate these effects, we rethink current motion models and propose two innovations: Observation-centric Re-Update (ORU) and Observation-Centric Momentum (OCM). ORU uses virtual observations to correct accumulated errors during periods of track loss, while OCM incorporates direction consistency in the cost matrix for association. Our method improves tracking robustness, especially in occlusion and non-linear motion scenarios. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that OC-SORT achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time.
