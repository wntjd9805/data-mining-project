Object detection models in computer science are tasked with localizing and classifying objects in images. The success of these models heavily relies on the matching strategy used to determine which predicted objects correspond to the ground truth objects during training. Currently, various hand-crafted matching strategies exist, but they seem to have little in common. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework called Unbalanced Optimal Transport (OT), which offers a solution to this problem. OT not only unifies the different matching strategies but also allows for exploration of intermediate cases. We demonstrate how regularizing the matching problem leads to smoother matches and faster convergence of the object detection model, avoiding issues faced by other strategies such as Bipartite Matching. We also provide an efficient implementation of OT on GPU using scaling algorithms. Our code and additional resources are publicly available.
