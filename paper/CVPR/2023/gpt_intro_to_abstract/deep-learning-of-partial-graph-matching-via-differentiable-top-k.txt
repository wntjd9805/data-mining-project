Graph matching (GM) has been widely used in machine learning, molecule matching, and vision tasks. Existing GM methods focus on maximizing node-wise and edge-wise affinities, which leads to the Quadratic Assignment Problem. However, the challenge of partial matching, where only a subset of nodes are matched due to outliers, has not been adequately addressed. Deep graph matching papers have attempted to tackle the issue, but there is still a need for a general approach to enable partial matching in existing GM networks. This paper proposes a novel approach for handling partial matching that can be integrated into state-of-the-art GM networks. The approach utilizes a top-k deep graph matching strategy to determine the matches with the highest confidence values. A novel attention-based supervised graph neural network is also introduced to estimate the number of inliers, which is often unknown in practice. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods on popular GM benchmarks, and a new benchmark dataset, IMC-PT-SparseGM, is also presented.
