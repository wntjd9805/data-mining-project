Cutting and pasting parts of an image into another image, known as image compositing, is a common editing task. However, simply adding a foreground region to a different image can produce unrealistic results due to different conditions when the images were taken. Image harmonization aims to align the colors by modifying the foreground region to reduce this discrepancy between foreground and background. Previous research has mainly focused on low-resolution images, while high-resolution images are becoming the standard for most real use cases. Although convolutional neural networks (CNN) theoretically can process images of any size, the computational cost required for high-resolution images makes them impractical. Some recent methods have explored high-resolution image harmonization by leveraging networks that take low-resolution images as input and further process them according to the network's output. However, these methods either simplify the problem or employ complex operations, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model that can harmonize high-resolution images using a dual branch approach. Unlike previous approaches, we interpolate the network output in parameter space instead of introducing interpolation errors in the image space, resulting in improved performance. We introduce pixel-wise color transformations (PCT) and demonstrate that a simple affine transformation is sufficient to achieve significant improvements. Our approach can be easily applied to CNN-based and Transformer-based models, and it outperforms current state-of-the-art models in terms of reconstruction error. We apply our proposed model to high-resolution images without downsampling, and we achieve significant improvements compared to existing approaches while keeping the network architecture lightweight and simple. Overall, our contributions include introducing the PCT-Net architecture for high-resolution image harmonization, utilizing a Transformer-based architecture, and demonstrating significant improvements in performance compared to existing approaches.
