This paper introduces the concept of mixed reality traffic simulation for testing self-driving vehicles (SDVs) in what-if scenarios. The current approach of testing SDVs in simulation lacks the ability to observe the consequences of the SDV's actions, limiting the realism and interpretability of the tests. The proposed framework, called MIXSIM, aims to build a reactive and controllable digital twin of real-world traffic scenarios, preserving high-level behaviors and interactions while reactively simulating different autonomy systems. The framework disentangles an agent's high-level goal from its reactive low-level maneuvers using route-conditional policies, enabling high-level controllability and realistic interaction in closed-loop simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MIXSIM exhibits greater realism, reactivity, and controllability compared to existing methods, making it suitable for simulating what-if scenarios and generating safety-critical situations. This represents an exciting first step towards a new paradigm for offline autonomy evaluation.
