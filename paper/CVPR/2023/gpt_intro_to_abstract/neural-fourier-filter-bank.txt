Neural fields have been shown to be effective for various tasks in computer vision, such as image compression, translation, reconstruction, and rendering. Efforts have been made to make neural fields more efficient and scalable by utilizing spatial decomposition and high-dimensional feature encoding. However, existing works do not consider these two aspects together, leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel neural field framework that decomposes the target signal in both space and frequency domains simultaneously, similar to the traditional wavelet decomposition. We implement the decomposition using neural networks and utilize a multi-scale grid structure with frequency encoding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 2D image fitting, 3D shape reconstruction, and Neural Radiance Fields. Our method achieves a better trade-off between model compactness and reconstruction quality compared to existing approaches. We also provide an extensive ablation study to analyze the details of our method.
