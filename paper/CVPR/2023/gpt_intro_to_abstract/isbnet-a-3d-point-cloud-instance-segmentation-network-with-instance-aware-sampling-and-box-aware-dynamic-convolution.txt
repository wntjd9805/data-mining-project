3D instance segmentation (3DIS) is a challenging problem in deep learning with applications in various domains such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. Unlike 2D instance segmentation, 3DIS faces difficulties due to higher appearance and spatial variations in point cloud data. Existing approaches like DyCo3D have limitations in accurately clustering instances and separating instances with similar appearance. To address these limitations, we propose ISBNet, a cluster-free framework for 3DIS. Our approach incorporates Instance-aware Farthest Point Sampling (IA-FPS) to improve instance recall and introduces a Point Aggregator to encode semantic features and sizes of instances. Additionally, we utilize the 3D bounding box as an auxiliary supervision and propose Box-aware Dynamic Convolution to decode instance binary masks. Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate that ISBNet achieves state-of-the-art performance without extensive modifications or hyper-parameter tuning.
