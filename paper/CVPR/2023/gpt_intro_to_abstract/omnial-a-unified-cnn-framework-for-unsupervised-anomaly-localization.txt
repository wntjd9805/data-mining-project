The paper introduces a novel framework called OmniAL for unsupervised anomaly localization in industrial scenarios. The traditional training paradigm of using multiple models for multiple classes is not efficient, so OmniAL proposes a unified training paradigm using a single model. The framework includes a panel-guided anomaly synthesis method, Dilated Channel and Spatial Attention (DCSA) blocks for anomaly reconstruction, and a DiffNeck module for anomaly localization. OmniAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in anomaly localization on MVTecAD and VisA datasets. The panel-guided anomaly synthesis method prevents the model from learning identical reconstructions and significantly improves existing methods. Additionally, the paper examines the robustness of separate and unified anomaly localization methods against adversarial attacks, using synthesized adversarial datasets.
