Cross-modal retrieval is the task of searching for relevant data across different modalities. While it has been studied for various pairs of modalities, such as video-text and audio-text, the most commonly studied setting is retrieval across image and text modalities. A naive solution to cross-modal retrieval is to learn a joint embedding space of the different modalities using known ranking losses. However, this approach struggles with the inherent ambiguity of cross-modal retrieval across image and text modalities. This ambiguity arises from the fact that a single image can be coupled with multiple heterogeneous captions, and visual manifestations of a caption can vary significantly. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this ambiguity issue, including cross-attention networks and separate textual and visual encoders. However, these methods either impose a large computation burden or fail to address the ambiguity issue effectively. Recent studies have introduced set-based embedding models that compute a set of heterogeneous embedding vectors for a given sample using self-attention layers. While these models offer a powerful yet efficient retrieval system, the similarity functions used for training do not consider the ambiguity of the data, leading to sparse supervision or set collapsing. Additionally, the self-attention modules used in previous work do not explicitly consider disentanglement between set elements, resulting in redundant semantics. To address these limitations, we propose a novel set-based embedding method for cross-modal retrieval. Our approach includes a novel similarity function for sets, called smooth-Chamfer similarity, which addresses the limitations of existing similarity functions. We also introduce a model with a slot attention-based set prediction module that captures the diverse semantic ambiguity of input without redundancy. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard cross-modal retrieval benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling the ambiguity issue.
