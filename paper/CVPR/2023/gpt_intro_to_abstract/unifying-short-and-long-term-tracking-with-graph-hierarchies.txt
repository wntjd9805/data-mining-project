Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial task in computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and video analysis. The commonly used tracking-by-detection paradigm involves detecting objects in each frame and linking them into trajectories. While short-term association using simple cues like position and motion-based proximity or local appearance is effective, challenges arise in crowded scenes where long-term association among detections from distant time frames is required. Existing multi-level trackers often have limitations in scalability and generality, as different techniques are used for different timespans, making strong assumptions about the cues needed. In this paper, we propose a unified method called SUSHI that processes videos in a hierarchical manner, addressing the limitations of previous approaches. SUSHI uses a learnable model that can exploit cues suitable for each timescale in a data-driven manner. The hierarchical structure of SUSHI allows efficient processing of long videos and does not make assumptions about specific cues for different timespans. At the core of SUSHI is a graph-based approach that operates on a hierarchy of graphs. Object detections in nearby frames are represented as nodes in the lowest level of the hierarchy, which are processed using a graph neural network (GNN) to generate short tracklets. New graphs are then built at each level, creating increasingly longer trajectories. Importantly, the same GNN architecture is used at every level, ensuring the generality of the approach. SUSHI achieves significant improvements in identity preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods in diverse benchmarks, including MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack, and BDD. By providing a unified solution across timespans, scalability, and generality, SUSHI sets new state-of-the-art results in multi-object tracking.
