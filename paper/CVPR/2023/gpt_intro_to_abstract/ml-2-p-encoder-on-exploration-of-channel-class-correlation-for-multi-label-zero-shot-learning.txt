The proliferation of smart devices and the abundance of public images have posed a challenging problem of accurately analyzing these images. While single-label classification methods have achieved success in classifying images, the reality is that images usually contain multiple labels. Multi-label classification approaches have been investigated, but they face the domain gap challenge when applied to extensive collections of images. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has emerged as a solution to transfer tasks from seen classes to unseen classes, but its application to multi-label scenarios remains non-trivial. Recent works have explored multi-label zero-shot learning (MLZSL) tasks and incorporated attention mechanisms into their models. However, these methods focus on spatial-domain information and overlook the potential of channel responses as semantic information for classification. This paper proposes a channel-sensitive attention module called (ML)2P-Encoder to extract and preserve channel-wise semantics for channel groups in MLZSL. The paper presents extensive experiments on large-scale datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art models.
