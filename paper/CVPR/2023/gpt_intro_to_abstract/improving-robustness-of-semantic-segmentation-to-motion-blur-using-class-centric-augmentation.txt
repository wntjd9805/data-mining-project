Motion-blur is a common issue in images captured by handheld cameras or cameras mounted on moving vehicles. Existing deep-learning-based segmentation models, trained on clean data, struggle to perform well when presented with motion-blurred images. Deblurring algorithms can be used as a pre-processing step, but their generalization abilities are limited and they increase latency and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a single-stage approach called Class-Centric Motion-Blur Augmentation (CCMBA) for making semantic segmentation models robust to motion-blur. Our augmentation strategy leverages segmentation map annotations to introduce blur in specific regions of the image, improving distinguishability and training. Our method is generic and can be used with any supervised semantic segmentation network. We report improved performance for DeepLabv3+ over baseline methods on various datasets, achieving significant increases in segmentation accuracy for motion-blurred images.
