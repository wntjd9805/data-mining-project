Visual place recognition (VPR) is an important task in autonomous driving and robotics, involving the identification of previously visited locations based on query images. However, extreme environmental variations and dynamic occlusions pose challenges to VPR methods. Traditionally, a two-stage strategy is used, where global features are initially used to retrieve candidates, followed by re-ranking based on local descriptor matching. While this improves recall performance, it is computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose StructVPR, a new knowledge distillation (KD) architecture that selectively enhances the structural knowledge of RGB features using segmentation (SEG) images. Our approach achieves comparable performance to re-ranking while maintaining low computational cost. Unique to our method is the selective distillation of knowledge, mining suitable samples where the teacher network performs better than the student. We also introduce weighted one-hot encoding to incorporate prior information of labels, enhancing the representation of semantic classes relevant to VPR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StructVPR outperforms global methods and achieves comparable performance to two-stage methods on various benchmarks. With re-ranking, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art VPR methods, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness. Our contributions include the avoidance of segmentation computation during testing, the selection of suitable samples for distillation, and the achievement of state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.
