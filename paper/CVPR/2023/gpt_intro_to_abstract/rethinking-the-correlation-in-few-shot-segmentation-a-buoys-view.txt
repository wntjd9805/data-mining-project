Semantic segmentation has seen significant progress in recent years due to advancements in deep neural networks. However, this approach heavily relies on large amounts of pixel-level training data, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect. To address this, few-shot segmentation (FSS) has gained interest in segmenting novel objects with only a few annotated support images. Existing FSS methods often utilize pixel-level correlation, such as prototypical learning or affinity learning, to generate foreground masks or aggregate support information. However, these methods overlook the presence of cluttered backgrounds and intra-class variations, which can result in false matches and sub-optimal results. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes the Adaptive Buoys Correlation (ABC) network, which aims to rectify false matches in FSS methods by using representative reference features called buoys. The ABC network consists of a buoy mining module (BMM) and an adaptive correlation module (ACM). The BMM focuses on constructing representative buoys that can effectively capture diverse semantic clues from support and query pixels. It utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and a representation decay loss to ensure representativeness. Additionally, the BMM employs a cross-aggregation mechanism to make the buoys task-aware and resilient to large intra-class variations and cluttered backgrounds. The ACM endows buoy-correlation-based pixel matching with adaptive ability, taking into account the relationship between relevant buoys and their intersection. It leverages the optimal transport (OT) algorithm to compute an optimal transport plan that represents the structural buoy contribution specific to each pixel pair. The OT distance is then used to score matches, assigning less weight to irrelevant buoys and focusing on the structural similarity of related buoys.The contributions of this work are threefold: (1) The proposal of the ABC network, the first method to address false matches in FSS methods using representative reference features. (2) The introduction of the BMM and ACM modules for representative buoys construction and adaptive matching, respectively, which effectively suppress false matches. (3) Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the ABC network, achieving consistent improvements over leading methods in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings.
