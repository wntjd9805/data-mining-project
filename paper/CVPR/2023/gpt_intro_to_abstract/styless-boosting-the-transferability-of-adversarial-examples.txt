Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for various tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing due to their high accuracy. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are malicious images created by adding subtle perturbations to benign images. The transferability of adversarial examples, where the same adversarial example can successfully attack different DNNs, is an intriguing phenomenon.Image style, referring to the visual characteristics of an image, has been observed to be separable from image content, and style transfer techniques can generate stylized images based on arbitrary style images. Inspired by the idea that robust DNNs should rely more on content features rather than style features, we propose using stylized surrogate models to improve attack transferability by reducing the use of non-robust style features. This is achieved by adding an adaptive instance normalization (IN) layer to the vanilla surrogate model, allowing control over the style features. Through experimentation, we observed that the adversarial loss of the vanilla model increases faster than that of the stylized models, indicating that current attack methods tend to maximize the loss of the style features. To address this, we propose a novel method called StyLess, which uses multiple synthesized style features to compete with the original style features during attack optimization. By encoding the synthesized style features into a surrogate model via an IN layer, we create stylized surrogate models and update adversarial examples using the gradients of both stylized and vanilla models. Experimental results demonstrate that StyLess significantly enhances the transferability of adversarial attacks on both unsecured and secured black-box DNNs. In summary, our contributions include introducing the perspective that original style features may hinder attack transferability, proposing the StyLess attack to minimize the use of original style features, and demonstrating the effectiveness of StyLess in improving attack transferability on various black-box DNNs. Furthermore, StyLess is a versatile approach that can be combined with existing attack techniques.
