Facial landmark detection plays a crucial role in various computer vision and graphics applications. The current state-of-the-art solutions for this task rely on neural networks and predict a fixed set of landmarks on the face. However, recent research has shown that predicting denser landmarks can lead to better performance in certain applications. The traditional approach requires deciding on the number and layout of landmarks ahead of time, obtaining annotated data, and training the detector. This limits the flexibility and adaptability of the detector for different applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method for continuous and unlimited landmark detection at runtime. Our method allows for an arbitrary number of landmarks to be predicted in any layout without the need for retraining. The design of our method combines an image feature extractor with a queried landmark predictor, which takes an image descriptor and a 3D query point relative to a template 3D face surface to predict the corresponding 2D landmark location. Our approach is modular, allowing for different architecture options that balance accuracy and runtime. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by predicting landmarks on volumetric features such as the skull, jaw, teeth, and eyes. Moreover, our method can leverage multiple datasets with inconsistent annotations, making it powerful for various applications in face capture. The main advantages of our method are the ability to predict any desired landmark at inference time, track non-standard landmarks, and work with volumetric features. The size of the neural network is independent of the number of output landmarks. Overall, our continuous landmark detector offers improved flexibility, adaptability, and performance for multiple applications in computer vision and graphics.
