Biomedical microscopy plays a crucial role in biomedical research and clinical medicine. With the rise of digital pathology and whole-slide images (WSIs), computer vision and machine learning-based approaches have become essential for analyzing microscopy data. However, several challenges exist in biomedical microscopy, such as large image resolutions and limited annotations. The majority of computer vision research in this field has focused on weakly supervised, patch-based, multiple instance learning (MIL) for WSI classification. End-to-end MIL frameworks rely on weak annotations, which necessitates better methods for self-supervised representation learning (SSL) in biomedical microscopy. Existing SSL methods for patch-level representation learning have limitations and neglect the patient-slide-patch data hierarchy. This paper introduces a method called HiDisc that leverages the hierarchical structure of clinical biomedical microscopy for self-supervised visual representation learning. HiDisc defines a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that considers the patient-slide-patch hierarchy. By sampling patches across the data hierarchy, HiDisc enables better visual representation learning and eliminates the need for strong, out-of-domain data augmentations. The HiDisc method is benchmarked on two computer vision tasks using diverse biomedical microscopy datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to other SSL methods. This research showcases how hierarchical discriminative learning can enhance self-supervised visual representations in biomedical microscopy.
