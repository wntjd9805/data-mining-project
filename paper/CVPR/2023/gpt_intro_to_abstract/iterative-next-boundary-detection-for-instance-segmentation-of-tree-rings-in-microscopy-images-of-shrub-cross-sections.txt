This paper introduces the problem of automatic tree ring detection in dendrochronological analysis of shrubs. The existing manual analysis methods limit the size of ecological studies. The authors propose a new method called Iterative Next Boundary Detection (INBD) that addresses the challenges of high resolution and faint boundaries, high precision requirements, wedging rings, and disconnected rings. They provide a new dataset of shrub cross sections and compare their method with previous generic instance segmentation methods, showing better results. The contributions of this paper include the publication of a new dataset, the development of the specialized method INBD, and the evaluation and comparison of previous methods.
