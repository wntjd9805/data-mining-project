Building large 3D reconstructions from unordered image collections is crucial for crowd-sourced mapping systems. The current approach, Structure-from-Motion, estimates camera parameters and scene geometry using a 3D point cloud. Structure-from-Motion methods can be categorized into incremental methods and global methods. Incremental methods sequentially grow a reconstruction by triangulating and registering new images, while global methods estimate pairwise geometries and aggregate them. Incremental methods are more robust and accurate but computationally expensive, limiting scalability. Global methods require less computational effort but lack accuracy and have not been as successful. Global methods typically use rotation averaging to estimate globally consistent rotations. Previous methods have focused on optimizing the rotation averaging problem but have not considered the suitability of the cost function itself. This paper proposes a new approach to rotation averaging that better models the noise distributions and directly propagates uncertainty from point correspondences. By leveraging these uncertainties, more accurate estimates of absolute rotations can be obtained, reducing the gap between incremental and global methods. Additionally, the paper explores incorporating a variant of the MAGSAC loss into the rotation averaging problem, which fits well into the context of rotation-averaging with uncertainty-reweighted costs.
