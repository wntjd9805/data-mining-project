Representing 3D shapes is a crucial task in computer vision, and Deep Implicit Function (DIF) has become popular for efficiently learning the representation of 3D objects and scenes. Existing DIF methods can be classified into global and local approaches, but both suffer from limitations such as long training time, low reconstruction accuracy, and difficulty in capturing fine geometric details. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Local Pattern-specific Implicit Function (LP-DIF). LP-DIF utilizes multiple decoders to represent clusters of local regions with similar patterns, reducing data imbalance and simplifying the learning of fine geometric details. We also introduce a region re-weighting module to handle imbalanced distributions of local regions. Our experimental results show that LP-DIF outperforms previous methods in reconstructing highly detailed geometry and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in surface reconstruction for various benchmarks.
