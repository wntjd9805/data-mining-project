Abstract:Deep learning networks have shown impressive performance in homography estimation tasks but lack explainability compared to classic algorithms. Current research aims to combine the robustness of deep learning with the explainability of classical algorithms for multimodal image alignment. However, these methods often suffer from poor local optimality due to the high nonconvexity of homography estimation. This paper investigates the DeepLK training algorithm, which utilizes a deep neural network and a training algorithm to align images from different modalities. The authors propose a novel approach called PRISE, which enforces deep neural networks to learn star-convex loss landscapes for better local optimality. The PRISE method significantly outperforms DeepLK and achieves state-of-the-art results in multimodal image alignment. The paper also provides analysis on the quality of solutions and demonstrates improved accuracy, especially for small pixel errors. This research contributes to the exploration of star-convexity in deep learning and provides a more explainable and accurate method for multimodal image alignment.
