Image recognition in challenging environments still needs improvement, particularly for sensitive applications like mobility sensing and head-mounted wearables. To address this, image enhancement and restoration methods using deep neural networks (DNN) have been proposed. However, using these methods as preprocessing for image recognition models has limited accuracy gains. Another solution is to prepare datasets for difficult environments, but manual annotation is difficult and time-consuming. To overcome these challenges, we aim to train image recognition models using a training dataset in simple environments and apply domain adaptation techniques. However, traditional augmentations on sRGB space are ineffective due to the nonlinear mapping of image signal processors (ISP). Instead, we propose augmentation on RAW images, applied before the ISP, to overcome the domain gap. We also address differences in noise amount and distribution by aligning the light intensity and noise domains. Our contributions include emphasizing the importance of augmentation before ISP, proposing a noise amount alignment method that considers prior noise in the input image, and providing qualitative analysis to show the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
