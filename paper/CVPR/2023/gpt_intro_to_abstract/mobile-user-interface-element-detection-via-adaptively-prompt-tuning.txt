This paper addresses the challenge of Mobile User Interface (MUI) element detection, which has received less attention compared to general object detection tasks. The risks associated with MUI, such as illegal gambling, malware, security, privacy, copy/fake, and fraudulent behaviors, necessitate the development of accurate and robust detection approaches. The authors propose MUI element detection as a variant of object detection and introduce a new dataset called MUI-zh, which includes OCR descriptions as supplemental information for each element. The difference between object detection and MUI element detection lies in the presence of OCR descriptions, which greatly affect the detection results. To leverage this additional modality, the authors introduce Adaptive Prompt Tuning (APT), a module that finetunes category prompts for MUI element detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of APT in improving the performance of CLIP-based detectors. The contributions of this work include the development of the MUI-zh dataset, the introduction of the APT module, and competitive improvements in MUI element detection.
