This paper introduces the concept of generalizable implicit neural representations (INRs) for representing complex data as continuous functions. INRs use a parameterized neural network, such as a coordinate-based MLP, to map input coordinates to output features. However, traditional INRs lack generalization capabilities and require separate training for each data instance. To address this limitation, the authors propose a framework for generalizable INRs using Instance Pattern Composers. This framework modulates a small set of MLP weights, allowing the network to represent complex data by composing low-level patterns within each instance. The remaining weights define a pattern composition rule for composing instance content patterns in an instance-agnostic manner. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework through experiments on various domains and tasks, showcasing its compatibility with optimization-based meta-learning and hypernetwork approaches. The contributions include the ability to represent complex data with minimal weight modulation, compatibility with meta-learning and hypernetworks, and extensive experimental validation.
