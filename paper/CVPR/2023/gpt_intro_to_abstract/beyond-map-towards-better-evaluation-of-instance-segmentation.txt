In this paper, we address the problem of instance segmentation in computer vision tasks. Unlike classification and semantic segmentation, which have fixed output spaces, instance segmentation requires counting and localizing an arbitrary number of objects in a scene. Existing methods for instance segmentation can be categorized as top-down or bottom-up approaches. Top-down methods propose candidate object proposals and refine them through localization and classification processes, while bottom-up methods group pixels based on similarity to detect instances. We observe that top-down methods generally outperform bottom-up methods in terms of mean average precision (mAP), but there is a significant gap in qualitative performance. We analyze this phenomenon and find that increasing the number of low-confidence predictions can improve mAP in top-down methods. However, recent design choices exacerbate this problem. We compare various instance segmentation approaches, such as Mask R-CNN, SOLO, and DETR/QueryInst, which implement different query-key interactions to extract object representations. We then analyze the evaluation metrics for detection and segmentation models, particularly mAP, and discuss its limitations. We propose alternative metrics that explicitly quantify false positives both spatially and categorically, and introduce a Semantic Sorting and NMS module to mitigate the excessive number of predictions while maintaining mAP performance.
