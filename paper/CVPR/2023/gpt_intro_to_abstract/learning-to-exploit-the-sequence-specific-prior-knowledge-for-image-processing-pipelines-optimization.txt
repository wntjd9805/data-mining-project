In this paper, we introduce a sequential ISP hyperparameter prediction framework inspired by hardware ISPs. We address the challenge of manually tuning the complex parameter space of hardware ISPs by proposing a method that predicts a group of parameters from several ISP modules at each step, using a sequential CNN model and Global Similarity Grouping. This framework takes into account the inherent sequence and critical intra-correlation among hyperparameters in hardware ISPs. We show that our method outperforms existing methods for hyperparameter optimization and prediction in hardware ISPs.
