The paper introduces the problem of high computation costs in generating realistic and diverse 3D point clouds using diffusion models. The transport trajectory learning process in diffusion models requires thousands of generative steps, leading to inefficiency in practice. To address this challenge, the paper proposes Point Straight Flow (PSF), a one-step generative model for 3D point cloud generation. PSF learns a straight transport trajectory from a noisy point cloud to a desired 3D shape by optimizing the transport flow cost. The paper also presents a distillation technique to shorten the trajectory into one step. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that PSF can generate high-quality point cloud shapes with increased efficiency compared to diffusion-based generators. The proposed model is also shown to be effective in real-world applications such as point cloud completion and training-free text-guided generation. Overall, the paper contributes a novel approach to 3D point cloud generation that combines efficient one-step learning with distillation strategies.
