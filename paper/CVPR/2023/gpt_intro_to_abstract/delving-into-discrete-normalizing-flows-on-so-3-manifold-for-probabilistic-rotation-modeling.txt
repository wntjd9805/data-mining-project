This paper addresses the need for neural networks to express uncertainty in their predictions for safety and interpretability-critical systems. Specifically, the paper focuses on the task of rotation regression and the benefits of uncertainty-aware predictions in computer vision and robotics applications. Previous work has attempted to model the uncertainty of rotation using various distributions, but these single-modal distributions are not effective for objects with continuous symmetry. The paper proposes the use of normalizing flows, which map samples from a simple base distribution to target distributions using invertible transformations, as a flexible method for expressing complex distributions. However, normalizing flows on the SO(3) manifold, which represents rotations, are still under-explored. Existing approaches either adapt normalizing flows in Euclidean space or propose general normalizing flows for non-Euclidean spaces, but these approaches have limitations and do not effectively model rotations in the SO(3) space. In this work, the authors introduce discrete normalizing flows for rotations on the SO(3) manifold. The proposed method combines a Mobius coupling layer with rotation matrix representation and an affine transformation with quaternion representation to enhance the capacity of rotation normalizing flows. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods in fitting target distributions on the SO(3) manifold and regressing target distributions given input image conditions.
