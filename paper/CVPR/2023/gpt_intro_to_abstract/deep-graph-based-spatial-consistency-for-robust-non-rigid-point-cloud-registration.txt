Non-rigid point cloud registration is a challenging problem in computer graphics, computer vision, and robotics. It involves finding the warping function that transforms a source point cloud to a target one, taking into account incomplete and partially overlapping point clouds. Previous methods have achieved high-quality correspondences in rigid cases, but they struggle in deformable cases due to the presence of outliers. Outlier rejection is a common technique for robust point cloud registration, but existing methods focus mainly on rigid registration. In this paper, we propose a novel outlier rejection network called Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) for non-rigid point cloud registration. We leverage the local rigidity of non-rigid deformations and design a graph-based local spatial consistency measure to evaluate the compatibility between correspondences. By using an attention-based correspondence embedding module, we extract spatial-consistency-aware features that help classify correspondences as inliers or outliers. Our method achieves superior results compared to the state-of-the-art methods on three challenging benchmarks. Our contributions include the first learning-based approach to outlier correspondence pruning for non-rigid scenarios, a graph-based local spatial consistency measure, and an attention-based correspondence embedding module for robust correspondence representation.
