Medical imaging plays a vital role in diagnosing anatomical structures and pathologies. Deep learning methods applied to high-quality medical images have shown promise in disease analysis and diagnosis, outperforming healthcare professionals. However, obtaining high-quality images in clinical practice is not always feasible, as medical images often exhibit variations in quality due to factors like patient movements or environmental conditions. These degradations can increase uncertainty in pathological observation and lead to misdiagnosis. Image degradations can significantly affect diagnostic semantics and measurements, making it challenging to distinguish between degradations and abnormalities, leading to false knowledge of lesions and misdiagnosis. Previous works have focused on discarding low-quality images, but this approach wastes valuable clinical data. This paper introduces the problem of image quality-aware diagnosis (IQAD) and proposes a novel meta-knowledge co-embedding network (MKCNet) to address this problem. MKCNet consists of two sub-nets, Task Net and Meta Learner, which leverage quality information to achieve an accurate and robust diagnosis. The proposed method effectively handles challenges related to annotation granularity and task focus discrepancy through explicit utilization of quality information and a meta-learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging modalities demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of MKCNet.
