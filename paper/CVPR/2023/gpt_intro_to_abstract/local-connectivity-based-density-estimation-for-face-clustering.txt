This paper introduces a novel density estimation method for face clustering. The method utilizes a KNN graph constructed based on cosine similarity between face images. A local connectivity estimation network (LCENet) is developed to estimate the connectivity probability between a node and its K nearest neighbors, taking into account local features. The local connectivity and similarity are combined to estimate reliable node density. The KNN graph is then refined by selecting edges toward cluster centers to reduce false positive edges. A pairwise connectivity estimation network (PCENet) is employed to determine whether two linked nodes belong to the same cluster based on intra-class and inter-class similarities. Clustering results are obtained using breadth-first search. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods on large-scale face and fashion image datasets. The contributions of this work lie in the development of LCENet, PCENet, and the superior performance in face clustering.
