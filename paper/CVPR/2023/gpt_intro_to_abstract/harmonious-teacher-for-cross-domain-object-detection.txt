Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in various downstream vision tasks. The development of deep convolution neural networks (DCNN) has led to significant performance improvements in object detection. However, the availability of large-scale annotated training data remains a major challenge due to the cost and time required for data collection and annotation. To address this issue, Cross-domain Object Detection (CDOD) has been proposed, which aims to adapt an object detector from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.In CDOD, self-training strategies have shown promise in leveraging existing object detection models to predict object category labels and bounding boxes for the target domain. The confident predictions are then used as pseudo labels to train the object detection model iteratively. However, existing methods for self-training in CDOD often use classification scores to select pseudo labels, which can lead to inconsistency between the classification and localization scores and degrade performance. Additionally, these methods rely on hard thresholding for confident pseudo-labeled instances, leaving valuable hard examples unused.In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Harmonious Teacher (HT) to improve the self-training framework for CDOD. We address the issue of inconsistency between classification and localization scores by introducing a harmonious loss that regularizes the consistency of predictions in both the source and target domains. To overcome the limitations of hard thresholding, we design a harmony measure to estimate the quality of pseudo-labeled samples based on the consistency of predictions. This measure is used to reweigh all predicted instances, ensuring that valuable hard examples are not abandoned.Experimental results on four widely used CDOD benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). For example, our method achieves a 5% higher mAP compared to the state-of-the-art method on the Cityscapesâ†’FoggyCityscapes benchmark. Our contributions include improving the self-training framework for CDOD by addressing the inconsistency between classification and localization, introducing the Harmonious Teacher approach, and achieving superior performance on CDOD benchmarks.
