Semantic segmentation, the task of assigning semantic labels to each pixel in an image, is crucial in computer vision with applications in autonomous driving, image editing, and robotics. However, training semantic segmentation models requires large amounts of annotated data, which is difficult to obtain. Collaborative training on multiple clients is a potential solution, but it poses privacy risks. This paper focuses on privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) for semantic segmentation, using the emerging distributed machine learning paradigm called FL.FL is a distributed learning approach that trains a shared global model without exchanging raw data among clients. Existing FL algorithms have mainly focused on classification tasks and have not extensively addressed semantic segmentation, particularly the class-heterogeneous problem. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a new FL approach, called FedSeg, for class-heterogeneous federated learning for semantic segmentation.The challenges of class-heterogeneous federated learning for semantic segmentation are identified and addressed in this study. First, semantic segmentation datasets are complex, and pixel-level annotation is time-consuming, resulting in non-IID data distributions among clients. This inconsistency in foreground-background annotations across clients affects the optimization direction and degrades the global model's performance. Second, even without foreground-background inconsistency, non-IID data distributions make local optimization diverge farther from the global optimum compared to classification tasks. This leads to poor convergence. The confounded embedding space further complicates the problem.FedSeg tackles these challenges by proposing a modified cross-entropy (CE) loss that aggregates the probabilities of background classes and addresses the foreground-background inconsistency. Additionally, a local-to-global pixel-level contrastive learning loss is introduced to align the local pixel embedding space with the global semantic space, enhancing convergence.Extensive experiments on four standard semantic segmentation datasets are conducted to evaluate FedSeg, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving segmentation quality compared to previous FL algorithms. The contributions of this paper include systematically investigating class-heterogeneous federated learning for semantic segmentation, proposing a strong baseline with a modified CE loss and a local-to-global metrics learning method, and providing benchmarks for evaluating FedSeg on various semantic segmentation datasets.
