Point cloud registration (PCR) is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision with applications in localization, object detection, and reconstruction. Traditional methods for PCR using point-to-point feature correspondences often suffer from outliers, making accurate registration challenging. Existing approaches can be classified into geometric-only and deep-learned methods, each with its limitations. Geometric-only methods like RANSAC are simple but struggle with high outlier rates, while deep-learned methods require large amounts of training data and lack generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel geometric-only method called maximal cliques (MAC) that mines local consensus information in a compatibility graph to generate accurate pose hypotheses. By loosening the previous maximum clique constraint, MAC is able to achieve accurate registrations even in the presence of heavy outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MAC on various datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning methods. MAC can also be inserted into deep-learned frameworks to boost their performance. Our contributions include the introduction of MAC and a novel PCR method based on MAC that achieves state-of-the-art performance.
