Camouflaged object detection (COD) is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to detect and segment objects seamlessly integrated into their surrounding environments. Existing approaches that mimic the human visual system struggle to effectively address the challenges posed by camouflaged objects, including intrinsic similarity and edge disruption. In this paper, we propose the FEature Decomposition and Edge Reconstruction (FEDER) model for COD. FEDER decomposes the camouflaged scenario into different parts, allowing for the identification of subtle discriminative features. To tackle the intrinsic similarity challenge, we introduce the deep wavelet-like decomposition strategy, frequency attention modules, and a guidance-based feature aggregation module. For the edge disruption challenge, we learn an auxiliary edge reconstruction task using an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-inspired edge reconstruction module. Our contributions include the first approach to COD from a decomposition perspective, the incorporation of frequency attention and guidance-based feature aggregation, and the use of an auxiliary edge reconstruction task. Experimental results demonstrate that FEDER outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets with lower computational and memory costs.
