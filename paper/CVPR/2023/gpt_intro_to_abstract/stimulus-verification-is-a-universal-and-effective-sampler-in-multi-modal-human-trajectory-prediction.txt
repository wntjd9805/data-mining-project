Human trajectory prediction is a crucial task in the development of autonomous driving systems and social robots. It involves predicting the future paths of humans based on their current observations. Multi-modal prediction, which considers multiple possible future trajectories, is particularly important in this task. Previous works have focused on designing prediction models using generative or classification frameworks, but the sampling strategy for selecting the appropriate trajectories from the candidate set has received less attention. This research proposes a new sampling strategy called stimulus verification, which considers the coherence between a candidate trajectory and its corresponding stimulus. By verifying this coherence, highly stimulus-coherent trajectories can be sampled as the final predictions. The proposed approach is implemented on multiple prediction frameworks and evaluated on three popular trajectory prediction benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving prediction accuracy.
