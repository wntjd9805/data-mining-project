Recent advancements in deep neural networks, such as CNNs and Transformers, have greatly improved object detection performance on public benchmarks like COCO. However, building detectors for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms remains challenging. Existing studies focus on designing complex models for accurate detection of tiny objects in high-resolution drone imagery, which is computationally intensive. On the other hand, UAV hardware is often resource-constrained, demanding lightweight deployed models for fast inference and low latency.To address the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, previous efforts have reduced the complexity of backbone networks in general object detection. However, these methods overlook the heavy detection heads used by state-of-the-art detectors, which limits their potential. Some recent methods, like network pruning and structure redesigning, show promise in accelerating inference but have limitations. Sparse convolutions present another alternative that operates convolutions only on sparse regions or channels using learnable masks. However, the effectiveness of sparse convolutions relies heavily on the selection of meaningful areas, and for drone images, objects often have small scales and foreground areas vary with altitude and viewing angle.In this paper, we propose a novel approach called global context-enhanced adaptive sparse convolution (CEASC) for efficient object detection on drone images. We introduce a context-enhanced sparse convolution (CESC) that captures global information and enhances focal features using a residual structure with a context-enhanced group normalization layer. This compensates for the loss of context caused by sparse convolutions and stabilizes the distribution of foreground areas, improving accuracy. We also propose an adaptive multi-layer masking (AMM) scheme that estimates an optimal mask ratio at different levels of feature pyramid networks, striking a balance between detection accuracy and efficiency.Our approach offers three main contributions. First, we propose CEASC as a novel detection head optimization approach based on sparse convolutions for UAVs. Second, we introduce CESC and AMM to optimize the mask ratio, achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we extensively evaluate our approach on major public benchmarks of drone imagery by integrating CEASC into state-of-the-art detectors, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining competitive accuracies.
