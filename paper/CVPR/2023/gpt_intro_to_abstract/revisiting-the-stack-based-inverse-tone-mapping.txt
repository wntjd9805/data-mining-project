High dynamic range imaging (HDRI) technology is used to capture and reproduce a wide range of luminance in nature. However, HDRI is unable to handle images that have already been captured, such as those found online. The inverse tone mapping (ITM) technique, based on deep learning, has been developed to recover high dynamic range (HDR) radiance from a single low dynamic range (LDR) image. There are two main ITM approaches: direct mapping methods and stack-based methods. Direct mapping methods learn an end-to-end model, while stack-based methods simulate the generation process of HDR images. However, previous stack-based ITM methods have limitations, including the independence of exposure adjustments and fixed lengths of the multi-exposure stack (MES). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel HDR reconstruction method with adaptive exposure adjustment. The method includes an efficient encoder with a luminance-guided convolution and cross-model attention block, as well as exposure adaptive block, progressive reconstruction loss, and mask-aware generative adversarial loss. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing ITM methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of a novel stack-based ITM framework, the design of an exposure adaptive block, the development of a lightweight and fast multi-exposure fusion network, and the creation of a concise MES dataset with optimal exposure labels.
