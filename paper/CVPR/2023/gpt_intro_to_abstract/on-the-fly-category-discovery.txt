Deep models have shown impressive performance in visual recognition tasks, surpassing human capabilities. However, these models are primarily trained on closed-set recognition, meaning they can only recognize predefined categories and are unable to model novel categories. Open-set recognition paradigms have been proposed to address this limitation, but simply rejecting out-of-category samples is not sufficient. Humans, on the other hand, are able to not only recognize novel categories but also determine if multiple samples belong to the same novel category. Novel category discovery (NCD) has emerged as a field of research to bridge this gap by splitting query sets into groups with the same latent category. However, current NCD approaches have restrictive assumptions and are not practical for real-world applications. To address this, we introduce the problem of on-the-fly category discovery (OCD), which removes the assumption of a predefined query set. We propose a recognition paradigm for OCD using supervised contrastive learning and hash-like category descriptors for instant inference. We also present the Sign-Magnitude dIsentangLEment (SMILE) architecture to mitigate the impact of intra-category variance. Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
