The widespread use of mobile devices with high-resolution cameras and the ease of sharing personal photos and videos on social media present a significant threat to data privacy. In response to privacy concerns, many societies have enacted strict legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires consent for individuals depicted in image datasets. While such laws protect privacy, they also have costly side effects for the research community in fields like computer vision and machine learning that rely on high-quality datasets of human images.Previous methods for anonymizing individuals in image datasets have used techniques like blurring or pixelation, but these methods render important facial attribute information indecipherable and can often be reversed by deep learning models. Other methods have used Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize new images with changed faces, but they often fail to generate natural-looking faces and preserve the original facial attributes. Additionally, existing methods often leave identifiable features unchanged, posing a privacy vulnerability.In this paper, we propose a new approach to de-identify individuals in facial image datasets while preserving the facial attributes. We work directly in the latent space of a pre-trained GAN, optimizing the latent codes with losses that aim to retain attributes and obfuscate identities. Our methodology involves using a deep feature-matching loss to match semantic features between original and fake images, and a margin-based identity loss to control similarity in the ArcFace space. We initialize the latent codes by sampling the latent space of the GAN and finding nearest neighbors in a semantic space. We also perform inversion of the original image to preserve texture and pose information.The main contributions of this paper are: 1. The first approach to address the problem of identity anonymization while explicitly retaining facial attributes.2. A novel methodology and loss functions for working with pre-trained GANs to generate high-resolution anonymized datasets.3. Thorough experiments on Celeba-HQ and LFW datasets, showing that our method competes with state-of-the-art methods in obfuscating identity while better retaining facial attributes under popular quantitative metrics.
