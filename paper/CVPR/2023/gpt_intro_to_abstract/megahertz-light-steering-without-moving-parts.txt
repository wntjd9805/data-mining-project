This paper introduces a new light steering technology that utilizes ultrasonic sculpting to achieve high scanning rates without any moving parts. By exploiting the acousto-optic effect, the technology transforms a transparent medium into a programmable optic that can steer an incident light beam. The pressure profile of the sound wave generates virtual gradient-index lenses within the medium, bending light beams and determining their trajectories. The combination of this optic with a pulsed laser allows for flexible and fast beam steering. The paper presents the physical and mathematical details of the technology and describes a new hardware design with planar transducers. Experimental demonstrations highlight the ability of the technology to perform ultrafast arbitrary point projection and LiDAR scanning. The paper also discusses the limitations of the prototype and presents a physics-based simulator to evaluate different designs. The contributions of the paper include the development of a significantly faster light steering technology, a new hardware design, experimental prototypes, a physics-based renderer, and a derivation of fundamental limits based on wave physics. The open-source simulator and additional details can be found in the supplement and project website. Overall, this technology represents a cost-effective, high-speed, and versatile light steering solution without the need for moving parts or complex fabrication.
