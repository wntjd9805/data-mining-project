Contact is an integral part of human interaction with objects in everyday life. Estimating contact between humans and objects is crucial for human-centered AI applications such as AR/VR, activity recognition, and fine-grained human-object interaction detection. Although there exist detectors for segmenting humans or estimating their 2D joints and 3D shape, there is currently no general contact detector. Existing work focuses on part-specific contact detection or is limited to constrained environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset called HOT ("Human-Object conTact"), which consists of images captured in the wild and annotated with contact areas and associated body part labels. Annotating contact areas is challenging due to occlusion, so we use two complementary data sources, including a dataset with pseudo ground-truth 3D human meshes. We train a contact detector on the HOT dataset, which detects 2D heatmaps representing contact locations and classifies pixels based on the body parts involved. Our detector outperforms baselines and demonstrates good generalization. We also show that it can replace part-specific contact detectors and improve contact-driven 3D human pose estimation. Our contributions include introducing the task of full-body human-object contact detection, creating the HOT dataset, and developing a contact detector with a body-part attention module. The dataset and code are available for further research.
