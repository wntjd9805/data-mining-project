Semantic segmentation is an important task in computer vision, but existing models often have high memory and computation costs, leading to slow inference speeds. Some lightweight CNN architectures and vision transformers have been proposed to address these issues, but they still struggle with reducing computation costs for dense prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a pruning parameterization method with bi-level optimization to enhance the performance of a state-of-the-art model called TopFormer. We formulate the problem as a pruning framework with a soft mask representation and use thresholding to convert the soft mask into a binary mask for training and inference. We also adopt the straight through estimator (STE) method to update the soft mask efficiently. We utilize a bi-level optimization approach to search for the optimal layer width in the token pyramid module, which extracts multi-scale information. Our approach achieves the highest mean class-wise intersection-over-union (mIoU) on the ADE20K dataset with a real-time inference speed of 56.5 FPS on a Samsung S21. In summary, our contributions include the pruning parameterization method, the bi-level optimization approach, and the experimental results demonstrating improved performance in terms of mIoU and speed.
