Accurate 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, with LiDAR sensors being the dominant method despite their limitations. However, vision-based approaches using cameras have gained attention due to their rich semantic information and low cost. Among these approaches, bird's-eye-view (BEV) detection has shown potential to close the performance gap but suffers from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a generative and focal distillation method for camera-only 3D object detection. We utilize queries to generate instance masks for masked generative distillation, resulting in more fine-grained and flexible distillation region selection compared to existing methods. Our work is the first to explore knowledge distillation on camera-only 3D object detection, addressing the challenge of distilling focal knowledge from imperfect expert models. We introduce FD3D as a plug-and-play module that can be easily extended to various detectors, achieving significant improvements in performance.
