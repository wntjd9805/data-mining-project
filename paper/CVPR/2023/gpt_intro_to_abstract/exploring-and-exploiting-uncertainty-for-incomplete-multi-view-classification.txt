Learning from multiple complementary views has shown benefits in various tasks such as clustering, classification, and representation learning. However, real-world data are often incomplete, which poses challenges in utilizing multi-view data effectively. Existing methods for incomplete multi-view classification fall into two categories: those that ignore missing views and those that impute missing data using deep learning techniques. However, these methods have limitations, including inefficiency under high missing rates, lack of interpretability, and inability to handle complex missing patterns.To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective model for incomplete multi-view classification. Our model characterizes the uncertainty of missing views by imputing a distribution instead of a deterministic value. We then sample from this distribution multiple times and combine each sample with the observed views to create multiple completed multi-view samples. These samples are adaptively integrated based on their quality, both at the single view level and the multi-view fusion level. We construct an evidence-based classifier for each view to capture the subjective probabilities and uncertainty masses, and integrate the opinions from multiple views using the Dempster-Shafer (DS) rule to ensure trustworthy utilization of arbitrary-quality views.The main contributions of our work are: (1) proposing an exploration-and-exploitation strategy that characterizes the uncertainty of missing data to achieve effective and trustworthy utilization of imputed data; (2) introducing a weighting mechanism for imputed data to leverage high-quality samples and mitigate the negative effects of low-quality samples; and (3) conducting experiments on classification tasks with multiple types of features or modalities, demonstrating that our proposed model outperforms existing methods and provides reliable uncertainty estimates.Overall, our proposed model addresses the limitations of existing incomplete multi-view classification methods and provides an effective and reliable approach for utilizing incomplete multi-view data in classification tasks.
