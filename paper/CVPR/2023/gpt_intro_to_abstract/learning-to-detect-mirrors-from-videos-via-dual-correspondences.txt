Mirrors can have a negative impact on computer vision tasks due to their tendency to reflect objects from their surroundings. Existing methods for single-image mirror detection have focused on cues such as context contrast and explicit correspondences. However, these methods do not address the problem of mirror detection in videos, which is relevant for real-world applications such as robotic navigation and surveillance. In this paper, we propose a novel network called VMD-Net to address the video mirror detection (VMD) problem. We also construct a large-scale video mirror detection dataset, called VMD-D, which contains annotated masks for 14,988 image frames from 269 videos. Our proposed method utilizes a dual correspondence module to exploit both intra-frame and inter-frame correspondences, allowing it to handle missing correspondences in the temporal dimension. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the VMD-D dataset. Furthermore, our method is efficient for real-time applications, with fewer network parameters and faster execution compared to the latest image-based mirror detection method, VCNet. This work contributes to the development of robust computer vision models for correctly distinguishing mirrors from surrounding objects in videos.
