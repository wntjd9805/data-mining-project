In this paper, we address the limitations of current object detection methods in closed-world scenarios and propose a new framework called CapDet that can detect and recognize concepts in a given category list while also generating natural language descriptions for new or rare categories of objects. To achieve this, we unify the pipelines of dense captioning and open-world detection pre-training, allowing the model to benefit from both tasks. Our experiments show that the integration of dense captioning data leads to significant improvements in object detection performance, particularly on rare classes. Additionally, our CapDet framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on dense captioning tasks. Our contributions include the novel CapDet framework, the unification of dense captioning and open-world detection pre-training, and significant performance improvements in open-vocabulary object detection and dense captioning tasks.
