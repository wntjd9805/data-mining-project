Radiation therapy is an essential treatment for cancer, but many patients do not have access to it due to limited infrastructures and trained experts. The treatment planning process involves a multi-disciplinary team and can be divided into static- or dynamic-beam treatments. Knowledge-based planning aims to reduce the time for individualized treatment plans using computer technologies, but current methods have limited generalizability. This paper proposes a novel conditional generative model, FCGAN, for precise 3D dose prediction in heterogeneous treatment contexts. The model integrates multiple conditions, including planning mode and angle configuration, and handles missing condition values. The paper also introduces a differentiable and spatially-unbiased loss function and demonstrates the effectiveness of deep 3D dose prediction for practical heterogeneous scenarios. Experimental results on clinical datasets validate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art models.
