3D articulated characters have become increasingly important in various industries such as gaming, film, and metaverse scenarios. However, the process of creating these characters is labor-intensive and time-consuming, even for expert artists. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the cost of producing visually plausible 3D characters. Recent advancements in 3D sensing devices have made it easier to capture real-world 3D data, resulting in a growing number of 3D real-people scanned datasets.Based on these datasets, parametric models have been developed to facilitate the reconstruction and analysis of human shapes, actions, and interactions. Deep learning techniques have also shown potential in inferring accurate 3D digital humans from single-view images or sparse sketches. However, there is a lack of focus on modeling 3D full-body biped cartoon characters, which are in high demand in the areas of gaming, filming, and virtualization.To address this gap, we propose a new problem: how to quickly produce 3D biped cartoon characters from easy-to-obtain inputs, such as a single image. We introduce 3DBiCar, the first large-scale publicly available 3D biped cartoon character dataset, which encompasses diverse 3D models covering 15 species. Each model in the dataset has a detailed shape, texture UV-map, and is unified in topology. Using 3DBiCar, we develop a generative model, called RaBit, for 3D biped cartoon character generation. RaBit combines a linear blend shape model with a neural texture generator to parameterize shape, pose, and texture to a low-dimensional parametric space.We evaluate the practical usage of 3DBiCar and RaBit through single-view reconstruction, sketch-based modeling, and 3D character animation. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to generate reasonable outputs for these applications. Our contributions include the introduction of 3DBiCar, a large-scale 3D biped cartoon character dataset, the proposal of RaBit, a 3D full-body cartoon parametric model, and the development of BiCarNet, a baseline method for 3D biped cartoon character reconstruction from a single-view image. We also discuss the potential of 3DBiCar and RaBit in other application scenarios.
