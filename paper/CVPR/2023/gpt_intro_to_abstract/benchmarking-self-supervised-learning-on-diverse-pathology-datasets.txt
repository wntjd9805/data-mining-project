Computational pathology, the analysis of microscopic images of human tissue, has gained attention as a research topic due to its potential impact on saving human lives. Deep Learning and Computer Vision methods have shown promising results in pathology, but require large amounts of annotated data, which is scarce in this field. Self-supervised learning (SSL), which trains on unlabeled data, has recently emerged as an alternative to supervised pre-training. SSL has been successful in natural image data but has not been extensively explored in pathology. This paper aims to evaluate multiple SSL methods on various pathology tasks and propose techniques to adapt SSL for pathology data. The authors analyze 4 SSL methods (MoCo v2, SwAV, Barlow Twins, and DINO) on 19 million image patches from the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. Evaluations are conducted on pathological image classification and nuclei instance segmentation and classification tasks. The study shows that SSL pre-training outperforms ImageNet pre-trained weights on diverse pathology tasks and introduces data curation and augmentation techniques to further improve performance. The authors also demonstrate that SSL is label-efficient, making it a practical solution for pathology where annotation is expensive. Additionally, the paper applies SSL to the task of nuclei instance segmentation for the first time. The pre-trained model weights are made publicly available to contribute to the research community.
