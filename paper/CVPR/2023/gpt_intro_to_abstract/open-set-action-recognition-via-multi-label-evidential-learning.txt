Open set human action recognition has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various domains such as security surveillance, autonomous driving, and face recognition. Unlike closed set problems that classify human actions into a predefined set of known classes, open set methods can accurately identify samples with unseen classes. Several methods have been proposed for open set human action recognition, focusing on single-actor, single-action recognition. However, in more realistic scenarios with multiple actions of actor(s), existing methods fail to accurately model the uncertainty and classify novel actions. This paper introduces a novel problem of detecting actor(s) with multiple unknown actions and proposes a new framework called MULE (MUlti-Label Evidential learning) to address this problem. The framework consists of three modules: Actor-Context-Object Relation modeling, Beta Evidential Neural Network, and Multi-label Evidence Debiasing Constraint. The proposed framework leverages actors' interactions with surrounding objects and context, estimates the evidence of known actions using Beta-ENN, and incorporates a debiasing constraint to reduce the static bias for video actions. A duality-based learning algorithm is developed to optimize the network, and theoretical analysis guarantees the convergence of the primal solution sequence. Experimental results on two action recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in novelty detection. The main contributions of this work include the introduction of the MULE framework for open set action recognition, the development of a primal-dual average scheme update algorithm, and the introduction of novelty estimation mechanisms to achieve better performance in detecting novel actions.
