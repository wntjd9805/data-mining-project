Video object segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision and has various applications such as interactive video editing and autonomous driving. Memory-based methods have dominated this field due to their superior performance and simplicity. However, these methods often struggle to generate accurate masks when there are object deformations and large appearance variations caused by camera motion and object motion. In contrast, humans are capable of accurately matching objects even in challenging scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose a two-branch network called ISVOS for semi-supervised video object segmentation. The first branch focuses on instance segmentation, which identifies different instances within a video frame, while the second branch performs video object segmentation by matching features in an external memory bank. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in single-object and multi-object scenarios.
