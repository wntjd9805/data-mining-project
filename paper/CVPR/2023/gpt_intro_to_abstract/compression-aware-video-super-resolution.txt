Video super-resolution aims to restore high-resolution frames from low-resolution frames by utilizing temporal information. Existing methods assume ideal inputs, but real-world videos are compressed with different compression levels, resulting in unsatisfactory results. Previous works have explored video super-resolution on compressed videos, but they are not designed to handle various compression levels. This paper proposes a compression-aware video super-resolution model that implicitly models compression levels using meta data. A bidirectional recurrent-based VSR model is conditioned on the compression representation and leverages meta data for alignment and updating hidden states. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The contributions include a compression encoder, exploration of meta data, and improvements in the VSR model.
