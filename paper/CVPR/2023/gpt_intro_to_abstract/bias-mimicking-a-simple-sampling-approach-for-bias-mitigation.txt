In this paper, we introduce a novel resampling method called Bias Mimicking (BM) for mitigating bias in predictive models. Previous research efforts have primarily focused on model-based solutions, but we propose a simpler and cheaper alternative using dataset resampling. We compare our method to commonly used resampling methods such as Undersampling and Oversampling, and found that BM performs comparably or even better in many benchmarks. Our method retains class-specific samples while ensuring that the bias distribution remains consistent within each class. We also provide an extensive analysis of different sampling methods for bias mitigation and highlight the importance of simple sampling methods like Undersampling and Upweighting. Additionally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method and analyze its sensitivity to the mimicking condition. Our contributions include showing the competitiveness of simple sampling methods, introducing a novel resampling method, and providing insights into the behavior of our method. Overall, our method offers a promising approach for mitigating bias in predictive models.
