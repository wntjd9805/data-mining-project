Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel in scenarios where the training and test data share the same distribution. However, real-world situations often involve distribution shifts, posing a challenge to the performance of deep networks after deployment. Additionally, obtaining labeled training data at test time may be impractical due to privacy concerns or limited bandwidth. To address these issues, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and test-time adaptation (TTA) methods aim to adapt pre-trained source models to unlabeled distributionally shifted target domains, while also facilitating access to source data. While SFDA methods have access to all target data through multiple training epochs, TTA methods process test images in a streaming fashion, offering a more practical domain adaptation approach. However, most existing TTA methods are limited to classification tasks, evaluated on non-real-world domain shifts, disrupt model calibration, and rely on specialized network architectures or source dataset feature statistics. In this paper, we propose a new TTA method called TeSLA, which incorporates automatic adversarial augmentation and introduces realistic TTA protocols. TeSLA employs self-learning techniques to adapt the model on test images using pseudo-labels, reducing the risk of overfitting. We propose a new loss function, flipped cross-entropy, which leverages the negative entropy of marginalized predictions to improve performance on various TTA protocols. We also introduce automatic adversarial augmentations to simulate images in the uncertainty region of the feature space, facilitating the improvement of the model's performance on hard-to-classify test images. Our contributions include the development of TeSLA as a novel self-learning method based on flipped cross-entropy, the introduction of an efficient test-time automatic adversarial augmentation module, and achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. TeSLA outperforms existing TTA methods in terms of calibration and uncertainty metrics, without relying on specific network architectures or source domain information.
