This paper introduces the rolling shutter (RS) effect, a distortion in images caused by the row-wise readout mechanism of CMOS sensors, and its hindrance to scene understanding and photography. RS correction (RSC) methods, including traditional and deep learning-based approaches, are explored. The limitations of the two-stage RSC approach are discussed, leading to the proposal of a single-stage solution called Joint Appearance and Motion Learning (JAMNet). JAMNet is a single encoder-decoder structure that allows simultaneous learning of GS appearance and undistortion motion information. It leverages a warping branch for undistortion and a synthetic branch for GS appearance reÔ¨Ånement. Additional cues are transmitted through a hidden state, and motion priors are injected via a transformer-based motion embedding module. A new data augmentation strategy, vertical flip + inverse order, is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that JAMNet outperforms state-of-the-art RSC methods in terms of accuracy, inference speed, and network structure. The paper concludes with a summary of the contributions of the proposed approach.
