Real-time object detection is a crucial aspect of computer vision systems used in various fields such as multi-object tracking, autonomous driving, robotics, and medical image analysis. The execution of real-time object detection typically involves mobile CPUs or GPUs, as well as neural processing units (NPUs) like Apple neural engine, neural compute stick, Jetson AI edge devices, edge TPU, neural processing engine, AI processing unit, and AI SoCs. Different edge devices have been developed for real-time object detection, focusing on low-power single-chip solutions, improving inference speed on edge CPUs, or enhancing GPU inference speed. Recently, the design of efficient architectures has become a significant focus in real-time object detection. This paper proposes a real-time object detector that supports both mobile GPUs and GPUs from the edge to the cloud.The proposed methods differ from current real-time object detectors by combining architecture optimization with optimization of the training process. The focus is on optimized modules and optimization methods, referred to as trainable bag-of-freebies, which strengthen the training cost and improve object detection accuracy without increasing inference cost. The paper addresses the new challenges and explores effective techniques for model re-parameterization and dynamic label assignment in network training and object detection. The model re-parameterization strategies, based on gradient propagation path, are analyzed, and a planned re-parameterization model is proposed. For the dynamic label assignment, a new method called coarse-to-fine lead guided label assignment is introduced.The contributions of this paper include the design of trainable bag-of-freebies methods, enabling significant improvement in detection accuracy without increasing inference cost. Additionally, two new issues in object detection evolution are identified: how re-parameterization modules replace original modules and how dynamic label assignment handles different output layers. Effective methods are proposed to address these challenges. Furthermore, the "extend" and "compound scaling" methods are introduced to effectively utilize parameters and computation in the real-time object detector. The proposed method reduces the parameters and computation of state-of-the-art real-time object detectors, resulting in faster inference speed and higher detection accuracy.
