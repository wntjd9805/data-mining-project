The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the applications of reconstructing 3D human motion, such as animation production, motion synthesis, and biomechanical analysis. It compares traditional marker-based motion capture (MoCap) systems with marker-less systems that use computer vision techniques. It then introduces the concept of monocular human pose estimation (HPE) and human mesh recovery (HMR) methods, which aim to recover 3D human motion from a single-view video capture. The limitations and challenges of monocular methods are discussed, including depth ambiguity and self-occlusion. The scarcity of paired training data for HMR models is also mentioned, as well as the limitations of existing HMR methods in domains with less available MoCap data, such as sports. The paper proposes bridging the gap between multi-view MoCap and monocular HMR by leveraging shared and complementary information in multiple instances of video captures of the same action. It describes the parametrization of each motion as a neural network and introduces the concept of the Neural Motion (NeMo) field. The paper highlights the contributions of the proposed framework and optimization scheme, including improved 3D motion reconstruction and global root translation recovery.
