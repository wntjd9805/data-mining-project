Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in human pose estimation, but they require high-quality inputs from controlled environments. However, in real-world applications, images are often corrupted by low-light conditions, adverse weather conditions, sensor noises, and motion blur. This paper focuses on studying pose estimation under extremely low-light conditions using a single sRGB image. The task is challenging due to difficulties in data collection and the poor quality of low-light images. To address these challenges, the authors present a new dataset of real low-light images paired with well-lit images of the same content. These paired images enable accurate labeling and serve as privileged information for training. The authors propose a method based on learning using privileged information (LUPI) to exploit the dataset effectively. The LUPI approach allows the learned representation to be insensitive to lighting conditions. The authors also introduce a new network architecture that unifies the teacher and student models through lighting-condition specific batch normalization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and showcases the advantages of the dataset and method. The major contributions of this work include the proposed approach to human pose estimation under extremely low-light conditions, the creation of a new dataset with aligned low-light and well-lit images, and the presentation of a strong baseline method that fully exploits the dataset.
