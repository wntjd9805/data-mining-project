This abstract introduces the concept of artificial emotional intelligence (AEI) and its potential impact on the development of artificial general intelligence. The authors highlight the importance of emotions in human interaction and propose that equipping AI with emotional intelligence will significantly enhance its interaction capabilities with humans and its environment. The paper discusses the current limitations in AEI research, particularly in the absence of pre-trained models and the reliance on human annotations. Inspired by how humans comprehend emotions through communication, the authors propose a new paradigm for emotion understanding that leverages the consistency between verbal and nonverbal affective cues. They introduce EmotionCLIP, a vision-language pre-training paradigm, and outline two techniques for capturing salient emotional expressions from human communication. The authors also present extensive experiments and analysis that demonstrate the superiority and transferability of their proposed method in emotion understanding. Overall, this abstract sets the stage for the rest of the paper, highlighting the research gap and the contributions of the authors in addressing this gap.
