This paper addresses the challenge of deforming stylized 3D characters to mimic natural human or animal poses in computer graphics. Unlike natural 3D models, stylized characters have distinct skeletons, shapes, mesh topology, and accessories, making it difficult to match their poses to a reference avatar. Manual rigging is typically required, which is a tedious and time-consuming process. While there are existing methods for transferring poses between non-stylized 3D humans and animals, these methods do not generalize well to stylized characters with different body part shapes. This paper introduces a model that combines learning-based methods with classical mesh deformation techniques to achieve unrigged, stylized character deformation. The model leverages a correspondence-aware shape understanding module and an implicit pose deformation module to deform individual surface points based on a target pose code. A novel volume-based test-time training procedure is proposed to encourage realistic deformation and generalization to unseen stylized characters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces more visually appealing and accurate deformations compared to baseline methods.
