Perception in 3D space has become a prominent topic in computer science, with a focus on both LiDAR-based and camera-based methods. Camera-based 3D object detection has gained popularity due to its cost-effectiveness and suitability for long-range detection. Multi-view 3D detection in Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) has shown significant advancements by leveraging multi-view features and temporal information. However, existing methods mainly focus on view transformation strategies while overlooking the importance of selecting the right features during transformation. This paper proposes an Adaptive Instance-aware Resampling (AIR) approach for view transformation in BEV 3D detectors. AIR aims to reduce instance localization uncertainty by selectively focusing on informative regions containing objects. The proposed method includes an occupancy mask predictor and a temporal frustum fusion module to further reduce localization uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing the learning of instance-aware BEV features.
