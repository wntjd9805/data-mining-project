Supervised neural networks have demonstrated impressive results in image restoration tasks. However, they require a dataset of corrupted and ground truth images, which can be challenging to obtain when the degradation model is unknown. To address this problem, self-supervised methods that only use corrupted images in training have been proposed. This work focuses on the problem of image denoising with an unknown correlated noise model. A novel self-supervised training framework is proposed, where bursts of shots are used to generate noisy targets for training. Statistical analysis of the target noise is also performed to reduce dependency between the input and target noise, leading to improved performance. Extensive experiments with synthetic and real image noise show that the proposed framework outperforms leading self-supervised methods. The contributions of this work include the proposed framework, the statistical analysis method, and the demonstrated superior denoising performance.
