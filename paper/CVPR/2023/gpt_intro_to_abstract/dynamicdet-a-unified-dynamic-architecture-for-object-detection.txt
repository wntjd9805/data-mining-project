Object detection is a crucial aspect of computer vision, with applications in various fields such as autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. Recent advancements have led to more accurate and faster detectors, but these methods often require the design and training of multiple models to achieve a balance between accuracy and speed. To address this limitation, this paper focuses on dynamic inference for object detection, aiming to use a single dynamic detector to achieve a wide range of accuracy-speed trade-offs. Inspired by the human brain's ability to process images at different speeds based on their difficulty, the paper introduces the concept of image-wise dynamic neural networks. While previous works have explored dynamic architectures for image classification, designing such a dynamic detector for object detection presents several challenges. Existing dynamic architectures rely on cascaded stages, which are not suitable for object detection due to the presence of multiple objects with different categories and scales in an image. Furthermore, the existing exiting criteria used for image classification cannot be applied to object detection. To overcome these difficulties, the paper proposes a dynamic framework called DynamicDet, which consists of two cascaded detectors and an adaptive router. DynamicDet is designed to exit with multi-scale information during inference and automatically choose the best route for each image. The paper also presents optimization and inference strategies for DynamicDet. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicDet achieves a wide range of accuracy-speed trade-offs with a single dynamic detector and outperforms existing methods in real-time object detection.
