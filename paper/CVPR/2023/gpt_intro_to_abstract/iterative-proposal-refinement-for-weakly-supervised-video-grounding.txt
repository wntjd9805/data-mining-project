This paper introduces Weakly-Supervised Video Grounding (WSVG), a method for localizing moments of interest in untrimmed videos based on query sentences without frame-wise annotations. The paper addresses the challenge of generating dense proposals for high recall while minimizing computation redundancy. Existing methods in this field commonly rely on densely-placed proposals, causing a high computational load. The authors propose a sparse and reliable proposal generation approach without any distribution assumptions. The paper also highlights two inherent drawbacks of current proposal generation methods: lack of explicit correspondence modeling and partial coverage of complex events. To address these issues, the authors propose a novel Iterative Proposal Refinement Network (IRON) that incorporates prior knowledge into the proposal generation process. IRON employs semantic and conceptual distillation to model explicit correspondence and refines proposal confidence scores using a label propagation algorithm. Experimental results on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets demonstrate the superior performance of IRON compared to existing methods.
