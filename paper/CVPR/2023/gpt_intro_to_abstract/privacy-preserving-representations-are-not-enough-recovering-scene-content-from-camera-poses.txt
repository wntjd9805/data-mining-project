Visual localisation is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision applications, including self-driving cars, autonomous robots, and augmented reality. Cloud-based localisation services are commonly used for XR applications due to reduced storage and computational requirements. However, these services raise privacy concerns as user data is sent to the server. Existing work in privacy-preserving localisation focuses on scenarios where attackers have direct access to the server or can eavesdrop on the communication between client and server. In this paper, we demonstrate a new attack that allows an attacker to learn about the content of a scene stored on a localization server without direct access. We show that a localization service will reveal scene-related information through estimated camera poses. This attack is based on the robustness of modern visual localization algorithms against changes in appearance and the availability of massive amounts of images online. We develop a proof-of-concept implementation of the attack to demonstrate its feasibility. Our contributions include identifying this new line of attack, demonstrating its feasibility through experiments, and proposing a research direction for privacy-preserving localization that aims to prevent information leakage through camera poses.
