Microscale 3D reconstruction is widely used in various domains such as medical imaging, life science, and aquaculture. However, image-based microscopic 3D shape measurement faces challenges due to its shallow depth of field and camera arrangement limitations. Traditional camera systems designed for larger objects cannot be used, and conventional mirror systems also have issues with depth of focus. In this paper, we propose a solution using a catadioptric imaging system that incorporates a monocentric front lens and a kaleidoscopic multi-facet mirror. This design enables deeper depth of field and clearer imaging. Our method allows for multi-view capture from a single physical viewpoint, contributing to free-viewpoint rendering, 3D shape reconstruction, and reflection analysis. Additionally, our teleidoscopic imaging system offers advantages over existing systems by allowing closeup and surrounding view capturing in focus. We present a practical calibration algorithm based on a structured ray-pixel camera model and evaluate the computation cost, calibration robustness, and depth of field of our system. Through qualitative evaluation on real-world microscale objects, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enabling holistic and dense reconstruction. Overall, our method expands the possibilities for three-dimensional analysis of microscale objects and scenes in real-world scenarios.
