Modern semantic segmentation pipelines have enabled a wide range of segmentation applications in various domains. However, the creation of training datasets, particularly the labor-intensive task of pixel-wise annotation, incurs significant costs. Crowdsourced annotation has been used to reduce costs, but it is not practical in domains where expert annotators are required. In such expert-driven domains, it is crucial to use the time of skilled annotators more efficiently. This paper focuses on two key properties that training algorithms should possess in order to achieve this. Firstly, algorithms should be flexible in terms of the annotation granularity an expert can provide, allowing for different annotation types such as bounding boxes or image-level annotations. Secondly, algorithms should efficiently exploit small quantities of pixel-wise annotations. The authors evaluate existing training algorithms in terms of these properties and present Decoupled Semantic Prototypes, a new expert-centric training algorithm that adapts contrastive learning and prototype-based segmentation networks to achieve semi-weakly supervised segmentation. The experiments conducted provide insights into the scalability and applicability of different algorithms in expert-driven domains, and offer guidance on how to allocate annotation budgets effectively. The contributions of this work include benchmarking segmentation training algorithms, introducing the Annotation Compression Ratio as a metric for analyzing annotation efficiency and expert-centrism, and proposing Decoupled Semantic Prototypes as an efficient method for expert-centric semi-weakly segmentation.
