State-of-the-art methods for 3D hand reconstruction prioritize either accuracy in 3D alignment or physical plausibility, but struggle to achieve both simultaneously. This trade-off is also observed in the methodology used, with MANO-based methods producing plausible hand poses and shapes but lacking in 3D alignment accuracy compared to non-parametric methods. Non-parametric methods directly fit a 3D mesh to image observations, but are prone to surface artifacts and cannot effectively resolve mesh penetrations in interaction scenarios. On the other hand, MANO-based methods are favored in hand-object and hand-hand interactions, despite their limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines the strengths of both non-parametric and parametric models to achieve high-quality hand meshes that are accurately aligned and have minimal artifacts and penetrations. We introduce a method to accurately map non-parametric mesh vertices to MANO joint parameters, leveraging a VAE correction module and twist-swing decomposition. Our framework can be trained in a weakly-supervised manner using 3D joint labels, and achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in hand-object interaction datasets. We name our method WSIM 3D Hand, standing for Weakly-supervised Self-distillation Integration Model for 3D hand shape reconstruction.
