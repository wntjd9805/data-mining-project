Physiological signals such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration frequency are important indicators of the body's functioning. Traditional methods for measuring these signals are accurate but expensive, intrusive, and uncomfortable to wear for long periods. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a non-intrusive and convenient method that uses an ordinary camera to monitor physiological indicators by analyzing the changes in light absorption caused by heartbeats. However, rPPG methods are limited to constrained environments. Recent deep learning approaches have shown promising results in more complicated environments but struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios with different environmental variations. In this paper, we propose the NEural STructure modeling (NEST) approach to address these challenges. NEST aims to narrow the under-optimized feature space, align domain-invariant features, and enrich discriminative features. We introduce three components of NEST: NEural STructure Coverage Maximization (NEST-CM), NEural STructure Targeted Alignment (NEST-TA), and NEural STructure Diversity Maximization (NEST-DM). Our approach does not rely on domain labels and is applicable to the rPPG measurement task. We establish a large-scale domain generalization benchmark for rPPG measurement and demonstrate the superiority of our approach through extensive experiments.
