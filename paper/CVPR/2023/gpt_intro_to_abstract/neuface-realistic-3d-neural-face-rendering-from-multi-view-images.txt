Rendering realistic human faces with controllable view-points and lighting is a challenging problem in computer graphics. Current methods rely on complex active lighting setups and require manual efforts for generating accurate 3D face models. Recently, 3D neural rendering techniques have shown promising results in recovering scene properties from real-world images. However, these methods are fundamentally under-constrained and struggle with complex cases like non-Lambertian surfaces. This paper proposes a Physically Based Rendering (PBR) approach, specifically targeting realistic 3D neural face rendering. The proposed method, called NeuFace, learns neural BRDFs to model facial skin reflection accurately. The use of a differentiable Signed Distance Function (SDF) based representation enables synchronous optimization of facial appearance and geometry. To address computational cost and data demand challenges, real-time rendering techniques and low-rank priors are incorporated. The proposed NeuFace framework achieves impressive face rendering results from multi-view images, offering applications in relighting and generalization to common objects. The main contributions of this study are the novel PBR framework with neural BRDF representations, the introduction of a low-rank prior for improved performance, and the impressive face rendering results achieved from multi-view images.
