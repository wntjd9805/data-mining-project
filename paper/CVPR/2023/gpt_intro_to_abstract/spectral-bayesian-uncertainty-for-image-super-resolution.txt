Image super-resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision that aims to recover a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) observation. While convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become the primary approach for image SR, these models often overfit the training data and may not be reliable or generalizable in practice. To address this issue, it is important to quantify reconstruction uncertainty when using these models, particularly in high-risk applications or under adversarial attacks. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a solution by capturing model uncertainty through distributions over network weights. However, existing Bayesian models for image SR primarily focus on spatial domain uncertainty and neglect the uncertainty in the frequency domain, which is highly relevant to image SR. This paper aims to fill this research gap by proposing a dual-domain learning (DDL) framework that incorporates explicit frequency learning within networks. By combining DDL with Bayesian approaches, the proposed model can estimate both spatial and spectral uncertainty of SR results. This work is the first to quantify SR uncertainty in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the spectral uncertainty, and a spectral uncertainty based decoupled frequency (SUDF) training scheme is proposed to enhance perceptual quality of SR results while maintaining reconstruction faithfulness. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of quantifying frequency spectral uncertainty, the introduction of DDL for image SR, and the development of the SUDF training scheme.
