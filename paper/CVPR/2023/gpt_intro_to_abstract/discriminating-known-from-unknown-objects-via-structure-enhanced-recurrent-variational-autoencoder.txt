Recent years have seen significant advancements in deep learning based object detection, particularly in scenarios where the training and testing processes share the same category space. However, in practical situations, the scenario is often open and filled with unknown objects, presenting challenges for close-set assumption based detectors. To address this issue, unsupervised out-of-distribution object detection (OOD-OD) has been proposed, which aims to detect objects never-seen-before during training without using any auxiliary data. This paper focuses on improving OOD object detection by strengthening the discrimination capability of the object classifier for known objects and synthesizing virtual OOD features that significantly deviate from the distribution of known features. The authors propose a Structure-Enhanced Recurrent Variational AutoEncoder (SR-VAE) approach that consists of two dedicated recurrent VAE branches to generate augmented features for both known and virtual OOD objects. The paper also explores enhancing the discrimination ability by constructing diverse environments using a VAE module. To address the lack of unknown data, a cycle-consistent conditional VAE is used to synthesize virtual OOD features. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in unsupervised OOD-OD, open-vocabulary detection, and incremental object detection tasks. The contributions of this paper include the use of classical Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator to enhance object-related information, the design of a dedicated recurrent VAE to improve discrimination ability, and the synthesis of virtual OOD features to distinguish OOD objects from known objects. Experimental results show significant improvements compared to baseline methods.
