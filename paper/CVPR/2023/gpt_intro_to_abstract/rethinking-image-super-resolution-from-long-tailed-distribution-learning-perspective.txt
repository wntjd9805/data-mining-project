Image super resolution is an important technique in image processing and computer vision. Learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in super resolving high-frequency regions. However, existing methods suffer from the twin fitting problem due to the imbalanced pixel distribution in natural images. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called Focal Pixel Learning (FPL) that re-weights the loss contribution of pixels to achieve better balance between high and low-frequency regions. Our solution is applicable to different super resolution models and is demonstrated to consistently improve performance in experiments. This work provides a reasonable explanation for the difficulty of super resolving high-frequency regions and introduces a novel solution using long-tailed distribution learning.
