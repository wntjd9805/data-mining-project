Neural networks have achieved significant success in visual tasks by using a large number of learnable parameters. However, deploying such big models can result in over-fitting and increased computational requirements. To address these challenges, researchers have explored different approaches, including Learning Sparse Networks (LSN) and Neural Architecture Search (NAS). LSN methods obtain sub-networks from a fixed architecture by minimizing the loss term and penalty term, but these strategies often sacrifice accuracy. NAS methods, on the other hand, sample and combine different units in a defined search space to form an architecture, but they require significant time and computing resources. In this paper, we propose AstroNet, a new approach inspired by the learning activity in mammalian brains, to optimize network structure while preserving accuracy. We introduce astrocytes to the M-P model of artificial neural networks to enable adaptive connection regulation between neurons. Astrocytes communicate bidirectionally with neurons and can regulate neuron connections by generating gliotransmitters. By extending the M-P model to the Astrocyte-Neuron model, we create a framework for structure learning.We explore the bidirectional communication property of astrocytes and formulate the Astrocyte-Neuron model with temporal regulation and global connection mechanisms. The model allows the astrocyte to regulate connections with pre-neurons based on received weights, propagating updated weights to post-neurons when the regulation tends to be stable. We construct AstroNet, which consists of a one-direction prop-agating neural network and a bidirectional astrocyte network, to regulate connections/weights adaptively.Our AstroNet can be used with multiple backbones and achieves improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to LSN and NAS methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in classification tasks using public datasets. Our main contributions include introducing astrocytes as neural units to optimize structure learning, building the Astrocyte-Neuron model with temporal and global regulation mechanisms, and developing AstroNet as a computationally efficient and accurate solution for structure learning.
