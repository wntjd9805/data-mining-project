Multi-class multi-cell detection and counting (MC2DC) is a task of identifying and localizing bounding boxes for different cells, followed by counting each cell class. MC2DC plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various clinical conditions such as anemia, blood cancer, infections, and celiac disease. However, manual cell counting is a laborious and subjective process, leading to significant variations among observers. Therefore, there is a need for an AI system that can provide robust and reproducible predictions.Although standard object detection models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in general settings, applying them to cell detection in medical images poses unique challenges. These challenges include limited annotated datasets, the presence of tiny overlapping cells, similarity in the appearance of different cell types, and imbalanced class distribution. Incorporating expert insights and knowledge into the detection models is challenging, as it may not always be available or sufficient.To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called deep guided posterior regularization (DEGPR). DEGPR uses posterior regularization (PR) to enforce that the predicted distribution aligns with the data distribution. We introduce explicit features guided by expert pathologists and learn implicit features through a supervised contrastive loss. Both explicit and implicit features are then incorporated into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and DEGPR constrains the predicted feature distributions to match the ground truth features using KL divergence loss.We evaluate the effectiveness of DEGPR on three base object detection models (Yolov5, Faster-RCNN, EfficientDet) using three MC2DC datasets, including a novel dataset called MuCeD for celiac disease detection. The results show that DEGPR consistently improves detection and counting performance across all datasets and base models. For example, on the MuCeD dataset, DEGPR achieves a 3-9% mAP gain for detection and a 10-35% reduction in mean absolute error for cell counting.In summary, our contributions include proposing DEGPR to guide object detection models using discriminative visual features between cell classes, employing supervised contrastive learning for robust feature embeddings, introducing the MuCeD dataset for celiac disease detection, and demonstrating the significant performance improvement of DEGPR over three baselines. We provide our dataset and code to facilitate further research in this area.
