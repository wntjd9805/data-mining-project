This paper introduces LayoutFormer++, a unified model for conditional layout generation in graphic design. The model aims to handle diverse user constraints while generating layouts that meet user requirements without compromising quality. Existing approaches have limitations in supporting different layout generation tasks and ensuring good controllability. LayoutFormer++ addresses these challenges by representing user constraints as a sequence and formulating the problem as a sequence-to-sequence transformation. The model leverages a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework and incorporates a decoding space restriction strategy to prune infeasible options and improve controllability. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutFormer++ successfully tackles various layout generation tasks and outperforms previous approaches in terms of generation quality and constraint violation.
