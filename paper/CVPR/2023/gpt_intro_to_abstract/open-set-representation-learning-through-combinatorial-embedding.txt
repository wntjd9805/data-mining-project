This paper addresses the limitations of existing machine learning frameworks in an open-world setting, where some categories are not predefined and the labels for some classes are missing. The authors propose an algorithm that aims to discover and learn the representations of unseen categories without any prior information or supervision about novel classes. The algorithm uses a combinatorial classification approach, where examples in unseen categories are identified by the composition of multiple meta-classifiers. The learned representations are further strengthened by unsupervised pairwise relation learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model through extensive evaluations on image retrieval and image categorization tasks. The paper concludes with a review of related works, a description of the main algorithm, and experimental results.
