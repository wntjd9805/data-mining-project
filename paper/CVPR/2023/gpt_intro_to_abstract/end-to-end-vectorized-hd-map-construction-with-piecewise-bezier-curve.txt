Abstract:High-definition maps play a crucial role in autonomous driving systems by providing detailed information about traffic elements and navigation. Traditional offline mapping approaches have been replaced by online learning-based methods using onboard sensors due to high annotation costs and untimely updates. However, there are challenges in modeling instance-level vectorized high-definition maps and efficiently performing 2D-3D perspective transformation. In this paper, we propose Piecewise B´ezier HD-map Network (BeMapNet), an end-to-end architecture for vectorized high-definition map construction. BeMapNet adopts piecewise B´ezier curves to compactly parameterize map curves with fewer control points and higher capacity. The architecture consists of four modules: feature extractor, semantic bird-eye-view (BEV) decoder, instance B´ezier decoder, and piecewise B´ezier head. We introduce an IPM-PE Align module for injecting geometric priors into BEV features and design a Piecewise B´ezier Head for dynamic curve modeling. We also present a Point-Curve-Region Loss for robust curve modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BeMapNet compared to existing methods. Our approach contributes to the concise and elegant modeling of high-definition maps using piecewise B´ezier curves.
