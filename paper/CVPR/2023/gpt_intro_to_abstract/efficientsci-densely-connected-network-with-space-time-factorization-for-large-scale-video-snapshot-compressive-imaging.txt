High-speed camera imaging methods often face challenges related to high hardware and storage transmission costs. Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) offers a solution inspired by compressed sensing (CS). This method consists of a hardware encoder and a software decoder, where multiple raw video frames are modulated by different masks and integrated by the camera to obtain a compressed measurement. The desired high-speed video is then retrieved using the captured measurement and masks. While mature SCI imaging systems have been developed, challenges remain in the decoding part. Model-based methods provide flexibility but suffer from long reconstruction times and poor quality. PnP-FFDNet and PnP-FastDVDnet integrate pre-trained denoising networks into iterative optimization algorithms, but still experience long reconstruction times. In contrast, deep learning-based methods that employ a Convolution and Transformer hybrid block (CFormer) can establish efficient space-time correlation. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that this proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results and better real-time performance.
