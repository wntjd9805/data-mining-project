Visual localization, the problem of estimating the camera pose from an input image with respect to a known 3D scene, is crucial in computer vision and robotics applications. Many existing algorithms utilize structure-based approaches that rely on a global sparse 3D model of the scene. However, the requirement for persistent access to the 3D point cloud and feature descriptors raises privacy concerns. Geometric lifting has been proposed as a privacy-preserving technique, but recent research shows that the scene geometry can still be revealed. In this paper, we propose Paired-Point Lifting (PPL), a new approach that constructs 3D line clouds by joining random pairs of 3D points. We demonstrate through empirical analysis that PPL enhances privacy-preserving visual localization while maintaining camera localization accuracy. We also introduce PPL+ to address potential limitations with planar scenes. Our contributions include the development of PPL, an analysis of success factors, improvement of the 3D point recovery algorithm, and extensive experimental evaluation against other baselines.
