This paper introduces a novel Multi-Task Learning (MTL) strategy for the simultaneous removal of rain and snow in images. Existing methods typically focus on single weather types, ignoring the potential connections and improvements that can be achieved by addressing multiple weather types together. The proposed MTL approach explores the connections between rain and snow at a deep representation level while avoiding the harm caused by the uniqueness of each weather type on the other. A Gated Knowledge Filtering Module (GKFM) is introduced to select optimal knowledge atoms for both tasks, enabling the exploration of connections and uniqueness. A Task-targeted Knowledge FeedForward mechanism (TKFF) ensures that each knowledge atom is directed to its relevant task. A SmartAssign mechanism is developed to facilitate the adaptive exploration of connections and uniqueness. Additionally, a knowledge contrast mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of knowledge assignment. The proposed method utilizes a transformer-based backbone encoder, which combines the modeling capacities of self-attention and convolution to address the limitations of CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in rain and snow removal tasks. The contributions of this paper include the novel knowledge assignment strategy, the knowledge contrast mechanism, and the use of transformer blocks with gated operations.
