Image style transfer is a popular research topic in computer science, aiming to transfer the artistic style of one image onto another. Existing algorithms have made significant progress in matching the style of the reference image and the content of the target image. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of achieving high artistic fidelity in the stylized output. In this paper, we introduce visual fidelity as a new evaluation dimension of style transfer and propose a novel approach called Quantizing Artistic Style Transfer (QuantArt) to address this challenge. QuantArt utilizes a global dictionary called the artwork codebook to convert continuous image representations into discrete encodings. By applying vector quantization and attention mechanisms, QuantArt enables flexible control over style similarity, content preservation, and visual fidelity in the stylization process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the visual fidelity of stylized images in various transfer settings. This work contributes to the understanding and improvement of image style transfer techniques by defining visual fidelity as an important criterion and proposing an effective algorithm to achieve high fidelity stylization.
