Local feature matching is widely used in computer vision tasks such as structure from motion, simultaneous localization and mapping, and object pose estimation. However, matching features across images with significant scale variations is a long-standing challenge. Existing methods only allow one-to-one matching, which limits the coverage of correspondences. This paper proposes Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision (PATS) as a detector-free approach to tackle the scale problem. PATS aligns the image contents based on their scale differences before feature extraction, alleviating appearance distortion. It employs a many-to-many patch matching strategy by formulating patch matching as a patch area transportation problem and solves it using Sinkhorn, a differential optimal transport solver. PATS also introduces a scale-adaptive patch subdivision to refine correspondence quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PATS achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness against scale variations.
