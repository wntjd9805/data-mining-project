Humans behave indeterminately due to various factors, making it challenging to predict their future trajectories accurately. Previous methods for stochastic human trajectory prediction have focused on generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs). However, these methods often suffer from uneven and biased distributions in the predicted trajectories. This limits the diversity of possible future paths, as common choices tend to have higher probabilities than less common choices. Some methods have attempted to increase diversity by adding objective terms to the training process, but this requires re-training the model and may not be feasible in all situations. To address these limitations, we propose an unsupervised method called BOsampler, which leverages Bayesian optimization (BO) to refine the sampling process for more exploration. BOsampler formulates the sampling process as a Gaussian Process (GP), where the posterior is conditioned on previous sampling trajectories. An acquisition function is defined to measure the value of potential samples, encouraging the model to explore paths in the long-tail region. BOsampler can adaptively update the Gaussian posterior based on existing samples, making it more flexible compared to other sampling methods. Importantly, BOsampler can be easily integrated with existing stochastic predictive models without the need for retraining.We evaluate BOsampler on multiple baseline methods for stochastic trajectory prediction and demonstrate significant improvements. By mining potential plausible paths with Bayesian optimization, BOsampler enhances the diversity and accuracy of predicted trajectories. This work contributes to the development of more robust and versatile methods for human trajectory forecasting.
