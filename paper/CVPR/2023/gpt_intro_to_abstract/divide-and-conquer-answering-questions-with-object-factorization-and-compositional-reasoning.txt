The goal of artificial intelligence is to develop systems that can reason with complex real-world data to make decisions. However, existing visual question answering (VQA) methods have limited generalizability and lack the ability to justify their reasoning process. This study aims to address these issues by developing object factorization and compositional reasoning capabilities in models. The proposed approach bridges diverse objects by projecting them onto a common space formed by discriminative prototypes and formulates the reasoning process with atomic steps. These prototypes are derived through object factorization and represent important semantics of objects. The framework correlates objects based on their commonalities in characteristics, improving robustness against object diversity and data biases. Moreover, it allows for interpretations of the model's reasoning process consistent with human thinking. The proposed method distinguishes itself from previous studies by emphasizing the composition in both objects and the reasoning process, and by tightly coupling them together. Instead of using black-boxed features, it decomposes objects into bases representing discriminative semantics and develops a prototypical neural module network to explicitly bridge objects with a compositional reasoning paradigm. The method demonstrates improved generalizability and interpretability, handling novel objects and variable data distributions. The major contributions of this study include identifying the significance of coupling compositionality between objects and the reasoning process, proposing a principled method for deriving prototypes through object factorization, developing a neural module network for structured decision-making, and performing extensive analyses on the roles of compositionality in reasoning with novel objects and variable data distributions.
