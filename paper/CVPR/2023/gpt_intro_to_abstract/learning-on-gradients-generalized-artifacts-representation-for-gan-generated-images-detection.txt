Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAE), have made significant progress in generating highly realistic media that is often indistinguishable from real images. However, these advancements also bring new risks, including the potential misuse of deepfakes for malicious purposes. Therefore, there is a need for forgery detection techniques to determine the credibility of media. Various detectors have been developed to detect GAN-generated images, but they often rely heavily on specific training settings and struggle to detect images from unseen categories or GAN models.To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection framework called Learning on Gradients (LGrad). We develop a new generalized representation of artifacts produced by GAN models, called Gradients, which are obtained by extracting the gradients of images using a pre-trained discriminator. Unlike previous methods, our approach relies more on the pre-trained model rather than the training sources, allowing for improved performance with unseen data.In our framework, a transformation model is used to convert images into gradients, which are then fed into a classifier to detect fake images. The indeterminate nature of the transformation model makes targeted anti-detection ineffective. We evaluate the performance of LGrad using images generated by ProGAN and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness in detecting GAN-generated images, even in cross-category and cross-model scenarios. Our detector achieves state-of-the-art performance in both known and unseen settings.The contributions of our paper include the development of the LGrad detection framework, which achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in detecting GAN-generated images. We also introduce gradients as a new generalized artifact representation and demonstrate the potential of using the discriminator of GANs for detecting GAN-generated images. Additionally, our framework transforms the data-driven problem into a transformation-model-driven problem, improving the robustness of the detector.
