Neural scene representations play a crucial role in computer vision tasks, but current models optimized for visual content preservation often generate artifacts when reconstructing polarimetric data due to the presence of a wide range of spatial frequencies. These artifacts pose a challenge for downstream tasks that rely on precise measurements from neural reconstructions of polarization images. In this paper, we introduce pCON, a novel architecture for neural scene representations that effectively allocates network capacity to learn difficult spatial frequencies in each pixel by leveraging singular value decompositions of images. Our model successfully reconstructs polarimetric images without introducing artifacts seen in state-of-the-art models. While existing neural representations accurately represent single images, they produce noticeable artifacts when representing multiple polarimetric quantities concurrently. To address this issue, we propose a new architecture that reconstructs polarimetric images accurately and preserves the quality of polarimetric quantities such as the degree and angle of linear polarization, and the unpolarized intensity. Instead of learning representations of images taken through polarizing filters, our model operates directly on the polarimetric maps. Unlike current coordinate network architectures, our model avoids artifacts in the predicted polarimetric maps by utilizing singular value decompositions commonly used in image compression. The model is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner to represent both low and high-frequency details, ensuring accurate reconstructions without introducing noise or tiling artifacts. Our model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing architectures, as shown in the visualization and table provided. Additionally, our model allows representations at various levels of detail, offering a trade-off between performance and model size without the need for retraining. Overall, our contributions include the introduction of a coordinate network architecture for polarimetric image representations, a training strategy that enables trade-off between performance and model size, and experimental results that validate the artifact-free reconstruction capabilities of our model.
