Autonomous vehicles rely on high-definition (HD) semantic maps to accurately predict the movements of other objects and navigate safely. However, current methods for constructing these maps are labor-intensive and expensive. This paper proposes a novel mapping solution called Neural Map Prior (NMP) that combines the benefits of offline maps with online map inference. NMP uses neural representations to build and update a global map prior by integrating data from a fleet of autonomous vehicles. This allows for timely updates and improved map inference performance. The paper demonstrates that NMP can enhance the accuracy of various HD semantic map learning methods. Overall, this work contributes to the development of more efficient and accurate mapping solutions for autonomous vehicles.
