Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a method that transfers a trained source model instead of the source data to the unlabeled target domain. SFDA has gained attention due to its ability to preserve privacy, ensure data security, and overcome data silos. It has shown potential in various applications such as object detection, object recognition, and semantic segmentation. However, SFDA faces a performance bottleneck due to the absence of source data and target supervised information. The state-of-the-art SFDA method, A2Net, has only slightly improved the performance compared to previous approaches on challenging datasets. Some recent studies have attempted to improve SFDA performance further by modifying the structure of the source model or changing the source data, but these modifications are not suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.To address this issue, we propose an active source-free domain adaptation (ASFDA) approach that achieves significant performance gains by considering two factors: identifying informative target samples and effectively utilizing limited labeled target data in adaptation. Existing methods have not fully addressed these factors. We introduce the concept of Minimum Happy (MH) points, which are samples that satisfy the properties of neighbor-chaotic, individual-different, and source-dissimilar. We propose a novel uncertainty metric based on neighbor environment uncertainty to measure sample uncertainty. We also propose neighbor diversity relaxation to ensure sample diversity. Additionally, we maintain the source-dissimilar characteristic of samples through our one-shot querying approach. Our proposed method selects target samples based on the source model, which better describes the distribution discrepancy across domains and allows for the exploration of source-dissimilar samples.To exploit the selected samples, we introduce a new-designed neighbor focal loss that assigns weighted neighbor purity to the cross-entropy loss of MH points. This allows the model to focus more on the selected samples and learn from them. Experimental results demonstrate that our MHPL framework outperforms existing ASFDA methods in terms of performance. In summary, our contributions include the discovery and definition of informative active samples for ASFDA, the proposal of the MHPL framework with various components to explore and exploit these samples, and extensive experiments showing the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.
