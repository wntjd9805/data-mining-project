Object detection is a widely used technique in various real-world applications, but it often suffers from a significant performance drop when deployed in an unseen domain. This is due to the domain discrepancy between the training and test data. Collecting a large amount of labeled data in new domains can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose Few-Shot Domain Adaptive Object Detection (FSDAOD) to generalize detectors with minimal cost. The FSDAOD assumes that only a few labeled target images are available for adapting a detector in the target domain. However, there is a critical challenge in FSDAOD due to the data scarcity in the target domain, which leads to a severe data imbalance between the source and target domains. Existing FSDAOD methods attempt to alleviate the imbalance problem by reusing the same target samples, but they overlook the leverage of source samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel asymmetric adaptation paradigm called AsyFOD. The AsyFOD leverages the source and target instances from different perspectives by dividing the source instance set into target-similar and target-dissimilar sets. We identify the target-similar source instances and use them to augment the limited target instances. The remaining source instances are considered target-dissimilar. We then propose conducting asynchronous alignment between the target-dissimilar source instances and the augmented target instances. Unlike traditional methods, the AsyFOD aligns feature distributions in an asymmetric way, which allows better alignment of the unobserved target samples. Our proposed AsyFOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating various types of domain discrepancy and generalizes well on various few-shot settings of domain adaptive object detection.
