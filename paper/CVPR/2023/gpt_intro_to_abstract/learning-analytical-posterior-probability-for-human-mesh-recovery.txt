Human mesh recovery is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in animation production and sports analysis. Existing methods for recovering body meshes and 3D joint rotations can be categorized as direct or indirect. Direct methods use neural networks to regress the rotations of each joint in an end-to-end manner, while indirect methods recover joint rotations based on intermediate predictions. However, both methods have weaknesses such as poor alignment with images or reliance on precise proxies. To address these issues, probabilistic methods have been developed to model the uncertainty of human poses. However, current probability models do not effectively reflect rotational uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new learning-friendly and mathematically-correct formulation for learning probability distributions for human mesh recovery. Our formulation is based on the matrix Fisher distribution and the von Mises-Fisher distribution. We prove that the posterior probability of joint rotations follows the matrix Fisher distribution, allowing for Bayesian regression in an analytical form. We also introduce a new human mesh recovery framework that utilizes the learned analytical posterior probability, outperforming existing baselines. Additionally, we propose a flexible multi-sensor fusion mechanism that allows fusion of different observations during training. Our contributions include the derivation of a novel analytical formulation for learning probability distributions, the proposal of a new framework for human mesh recovery, and the introduction of a flexible multi-sensor fusion mechanism.
