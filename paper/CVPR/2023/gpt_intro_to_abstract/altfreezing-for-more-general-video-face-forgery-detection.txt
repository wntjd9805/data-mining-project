Abstract:The rapid development of face generation and manipulation techniques has made it easy to modify and manipulate identities or attributes in face videos. While these advancements have led to important applications in movie-making and funny video generation, they also pose a serious threat to trust and security in our society. As a result, detecting video face forgeries has become a hot research topic. Current approaches focus either on spatial or temporal artifacts in fake images and videos, neglecting the importance of capturing both. In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy called AltFreezing, which alternately freezes spatial and temporal weights during training to enable a spatiotemporal network to capture both types of artifacts. We also introduce video-level fake data augmentation methods to encourage the model to recognize different types of forgeries. Through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting video face forgeries, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.
