Abstract:Understanding and monitoring animal behavior is crucial for comprehending the complexities of ecosystems, especially in the context of the ongoing biodiversity crisis. With the advent of modern sensors, such as camera traps, drones, and smartphones, collecting video data of animal behavior has become more accessible. However, manually reviewing and annotating this data is time-consuming and not scalable for large datasets. Therefore, automated animal and behavioral recognition methods are needed to enable large-scale behavioral monitoring and expedite the generation of usable data. To develop such an AI system, a diverse and representative dataset is essential. Previous datasets have limitations in terms of coverage, labeling, and environmental diversity. We address these limitations by proposing a new dataset called MammalNet, focusing specifically on mammals and encompassing 539 hours of annotated videos depicting 12 high-level behaviors from hundreds of mammal species. Additionally, MammalNet categorizes animals according to scientific taxonomy, enabling future expansion. We establish benchmarks for animal and behavior classification, low-shot recognition, and behavior detection. Through experiments, we find that animal and behavior recognition remain challenging tasks, particularly for less-frequent animals. However, behavior recognition for unseen animals can be transferred from observations of similar species, highlighting the importance of having access to target animal videos for more accurate recognition. This dataset and benchmark can serve as a valuable resource for advancing animal behavior understanding and aid in wildlife management and conservation efforts.
