In this paper, we address the trade-off between distortion and realism in lossy image compression. While previous works have focused on optimizing the rate-distortion trade-off, there is an increasing interest in considering the perceptual quality of reconstructions. We propose a method that bridges the gap between generative and non-generative compression approaches by utilizing a conditional generator to control the level of detail in the reconstructions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of distortion-realism pairs on high-resolution benchmark datasets, surpassing previous methods in both distortion and realism metrics. We also introduce a new measure of realism based on the distribution of real images and reconstructions. Our findings indicate that there exists an additional trade-off between realism and distortion, and our method allows users to customize the level of detail in the reconstructions based on their preferences.
