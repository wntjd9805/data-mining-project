Cytology image analysis plays a crucial role in cancer screening and diagnosis. Visual examination of thousands of cells under a microscope is time-consuming and susceptible to observer variability. Computational techniques have emerged as a more efficient and accurate solution, with cell segmentation being a fundamental task. However, cytology segmentation poses challenges due to cell overlapping and the presence of mimics and technical artifacts in the background. Existing methods fail to explicitly model the interaction between overlapping cell regions, limiting their understanding of cross-region relationships. To address these issues, we propose a novel decompose-and-recombine strategy for translucent cell instance segmentation, called De-overlapping Network (DoNet). DoNet utilizes a Dual-path Region segmentation Module (DRM) to decompose cell clusters into intersection and complement sub-regions, and a Consistency-guided Recombination Module (CRM) to model the relationships between these components. Additionally, we introduce a Mask-guided Region Proposal Module (MRP) to refine intra-cellular nuclei by leveraging a cytoplasm attention map. Experimental results on two overlapping cytology image segmentation datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DoNet compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our proposed approach improves perceptual capability in overlapping cellular sub-regions and effectively mitigates the influence of mimickers in the background.
