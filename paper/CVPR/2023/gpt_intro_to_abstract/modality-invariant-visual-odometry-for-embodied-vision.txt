Artificial intelligence has become increasingly prevalent in commercial products, providing digital services. However, the field of personal robotics and embodied AI aims to take AI beyond the digital world by embedding intelligent programs into physical bodies that can move and interact in the real world. In order for these embodied agents to effectively navigate their environment, one of the fundamental skills they must learn is how to traverse and locate themselves in the environment. This ability is vital for successful navigation and providing services in multiple locations. While agents equipped with RGB-D sensors and GPS+Compass sensors have achieved near-perfect navigation results in indoor environments, they often fail catastrophically in more realistic settings with noisy or partially available sensor readings, as well as in situations where the sensor suite changes or certain modalities become unavailable. This paper introduces the concept of "optional" modalities, where input modalities may be of limited availability at test time. The authors propose a modality-agnostic framework called the Visual Odometry Transformer (VOT) based on the Transformer architecture, which can accept one or multiple modalities and handle variable-sized inputs. The framework incorporates multi-modal pre-training and an action prior to reduce the data requirements for training and improve performance when only a subset of modalities are accessible during test time. By training the model with dropped modalities, the VOT achieves comparable performance to separate uni-modal approaches, allowing for traversal of different sensors during test time and maintaining performance even in the absence of certain training modalities. The authors evaluate the VOT on point-goal navigation tasks and show that it outperforms previous methods with training on only 5% of the data. The framework is not limited to RGB-D input or discrete action spaces and can be adapted to various modalities, opening up new applications of deep visual odometry in both simulated and real-world settings.
