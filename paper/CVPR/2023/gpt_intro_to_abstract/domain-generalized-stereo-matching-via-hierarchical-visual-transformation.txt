Stereo Matching (SM) is a computer vision task that involves finding matching correspondences between stereo images and calculating disparity for depth sensing. This has applications in robot navigation and autonomous driving. Recently, deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have been used for SM and have achieved impressive results by leveraging their strong feature representation abilities. However, existing state-of-the-art SM networks are typically trained on synthetic data and struggle to generalize well to real-world domains due to domain-specific artifacts in the synthetic data.Previous attempts to address the domain gap between synthetic and realistic data have focused on fine-tuning SM networks with labeled realistic data or training domain adaptive networks using both synthetic and unlabeled realistic data. While these approaches have shown improvement on realistic data, they rely on having access to target-domain realistic data during training and do not improve the out-of-distribution generalization of SM networks.In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of single domain generalization in SM, where only synthetic data is available for training. We propose a Hierarchical Visual Transformation (HVT) network that learns shortcut-invariant robust representations from synthetic SM image pairs to improve out-of-distribution generalization. The HVT network transforms synthetic training samples into new source domains with diverse distributions and minimizes cross-domain feature inconsistency to capture domain-invariant features. By diversifying the distribution of training data, the network is forced to overlook artifacts from the synthetic domain.Our contributions include devising a simple yet effective domain generalized SM framework using the HVT network, formulating novel learning objectives for optimizing visual transformations and capturing domain-invariant features, and conducting extensive experiments on four realistic SM datasets. The results show that our HVT network significantly enhances the performance of existing SM networks in synthetic-to-realistic domain generalization without the need for auxiliary data or features.
