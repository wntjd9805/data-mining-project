Artificial Curiosity and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention for their impressive performance in generating images. However, the training of GANs is challenging and often leads to low-quality outputs. Various methods have been proposed to improve GAN training, such as co-designing the network architecture, progressive growing, and data augmentation. However, enhancing the training of GANs remains an unresolved problem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to training GANs by considering the discriminator as a robust image classifier. We draw inspiration from studies on robust image classification and observe that training data is scattered in the learning space of classification networks, resulting in improper assignment of high confidences to off-manifold samples. This phenomenon also affects the discriminator's ability to learn the distribution of real data. To address this, we introduce the AdaptiveMix module to shrink the regions of training data in the image representation space. AdaptiveMix achieves this by reducing the distance between hard samples (difficult for classification networks) and easy samples (representative of the training data) in the latent space.Unlike existing methods, we explicitly focus on shrinking the regions of training data in the discriminator's image representation space. We evaluate the effectiveness of AdaptiveMix with state-of-the-art GAN architectures, including DCGAN and StyleGAN-V2, and demonstrate that our approach improves the training of GANs and enhances the quality of generated images.Furthermore, we show that AdaptiveMix can be applied not only to image generation but also to image classification and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection tasks. By integrating AdaptiveMix with suitable classifiers, we achieve consistent performance improvements on robust image classification and OOD tasks across multiple datasets.In summary, the contributions of this paper include the proposal of the AdaptiveMix module, which enhances GAN training and improves image quality. We demonstrate that GANs can be effectively and stably trained by shrinking regions of training data in the discriminator's image representation space. Additionally, we show the applicability of AdaptiveMix to image classification and OOD tasks, achieving performance boosts across multiple datasets and tasks.
