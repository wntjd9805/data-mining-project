Classical geometric modeling techniques in computer graphics represent signals using array- or grid-based formats, but they are not easily adaptable to learning-based frameworks due to their lack of differentiability. In recent years, neural implicit functions have emerged as a promising alternative, parameterizing the mapping between coordinates and image/object domain signals using neural networks. This paper introduces a new implicit feature representation framework called Multiplicative Fourier Level of Detail (MFLOD) that combines the efficiency of hybrid methods with the feasibility of Fourier analysis. MFLOD uses a multi-resolution feature grid/volume and modulates multilevel local features with frequency basis functions. It explicitly manipulates the spectral bandwidth of each level, allowing for high-fidelity details at fine levels and smooth overall shapes at coarse levels. The paper also provides theoretical analysis from the perspectives of spectral analysis and neural tangent kernel (NTK) approximation, demonstrating that MFLOD has better spectrum coverage and generalization compared to existing methods. Experimental results on various implicit neural representation learning tasks validate the superior quality and generalizability of MFLOD.
