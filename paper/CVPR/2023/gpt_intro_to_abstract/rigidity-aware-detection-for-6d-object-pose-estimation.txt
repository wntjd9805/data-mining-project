Estimating the 6D pose of objects, or their 3D rotation and translation with respect to the camera, is a fundamental computer vision problem with various applications. Current methods for 6D pose estimation follow a two-stage pipeline: object detection followed by pose estimation. However, these methods suffer from lower performance in cluttered scenes due to detection failures. Most current 6D pose estimation methods rely on general object detection methods, which are not suitable for handling the occlusion and complexity inherent to 6D object pose estimation. To address this, we propose a rigidity-aware detection method that leverages the properties of rigid objects, resulting in more accurate pose estimates in cluttered scenes. We compare our method to standard object detectors and demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple 6D object pose estimation datasets. Additionally, we combine our detection method with a pose regression network to achieve state-of-the-art object pose results.
