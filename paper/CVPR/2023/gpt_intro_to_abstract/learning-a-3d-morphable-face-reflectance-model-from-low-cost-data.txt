In the past two decades, 3D Morphable Face Models (3DMM) have gained attention for their ability to provide a statistical prior of 3D face geometry and appearance for various applications in computer science. However, existing models have struggled to accurately represent non-Lambertian effects such as facial specularity. Some recent works have incorporated non-Lambertian facial reflectance in 3DMM using various capture methods and training techniques. However, these approaches still fail to fully determine the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). To address these limitations, this paper proposes a morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF, trained using publicly-available data. The model combines a Lambertian BRDF with several Blinn-Phong BRDFs to represent specular intensity and shiness. To improve generalization and expressive power, the model is finetuned on a large-scale in-the-wild dataset. The paper also presents a strategy for reconstructing face reflectance coefficients and updating the model parameters based on feedback from reconstructed reflectance. Overall, this work contributes to the advancement of morphable face models by introducing a model with spatially varying BRDF and a technique for training it with low-cost data.
