The paper addresses the challenge of long-tailed visual recognition caused by an imbalance of sample numbers in datasets. Previous works have focused on improving the performance of tail classes by assuming that head classes are always easier to learn. However, recent studies have shown that classification difficulty is not solely correlated with the number of samples, and some tail classes may even outperform head classes. Therefore, it is important to explore other inherent characteristics of the data that impact classification difficulty and mitigate model bias under different sample number distribution scenarios. The paper proposes measurements for the geometric characteristics of perceptual manifolds in deep neural networks and investigates the effects of learning on the separation degree and curvature of these manifolds. The study finds that existing methods only address the effect of separation degree on model bias, while ignoring the impact of manifold complexity. To address this, a curvature regularization approach is proposed to encourage the learning of curvature-balanced and flatter feature manifolds, leading to improved overall performance. The proposed method effectively reduces model bias on both long-tailed and non-long-tailed datasets, demonstrating promising results.
