The introduction presents the problem of using spiking and event cameras, which differ from conventional frame-based digital cameras, in video reconstruction. While these neuromorphic sensors offer high-speed and high dynamic range capabilities, they record spike trains and event streams, which are less compatible with CNN-based models for video frames. Preprocessing modules are typically required to convert neuromorphic signals into compatible formats. Spike trains, which contain textured information, are more suitable for reconstructing high frame rate videos. However, the lack of color in the reconstructed frames is a limitation. Alternating-exposure and burst merging techniques are commonly used in frame-based RGB cameras to reduce noise and improve color synthesis, but these methods are not suitable for high-speed scenes. Building a hybrid camera system that captures both low frame rate color sequences and high-speed signals can be a potential solution. However, existing methods still have limitations in handling saturated regions or producing accurate colors. This paper proposes an all-in-one framework to reconstruct high frame rate (1000 FPS) HDR color videos by combining spike trains and alternating-exposure frames captured by a Spike-RGB hybrid camera system. The framework consists of three stages: deblurring, interpolation, and merging modules. The spike guided deblurring module recovers sharp images with faithful colors from blurry exposures. The spike guided interpolation module utilizes motion information from spike trains to fill in missing colors during the interval time. The merging module applies a variant of recurrent U-Net to suppress noise and maintain temporal consistency in short-exposure images. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method over existing HDR video reconstruction methods and commercial slow-motion cameras.
