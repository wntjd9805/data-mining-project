Abstract:This paper focuses on the problem of adversarial attacks on point cloud data, which is widely used in various 3D vision applications. Adversarial examples are created by manipulating the input point cloud data in order to cause misbehavior in deep learning models. The paper discusses different attack strategies, including shifting, deleting, adding, and transforming points in the point cloud. The authors propose a defense framework called contrastive and attentional point cloud learning (CAP) to enhance the robustness of existing classifiers. CAP consists of two modules: (1) attention-based feature pooling to capture global structural information and (2) dynamic contrastive learning to disentangle features of different objects with the same label. The proposed CAP framework significantly improves the robustness of existing point cloud classification models against various adversarial attacks. The paper also introduces a theoretical certification method to evaluate the robustness of the CAP framework, which allows users to estimate the potential risk of adversarial attacks in real-world applications. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CAP framework in improving robustness against different attack methods.
