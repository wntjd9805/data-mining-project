This paper introduces a novel framework for compressing volumetric radiance fields in order to address the storage issue of representations induced by using voxel grids. The proposed framework aims to reduce storage requirements while retaining rendering quality. The framework consists of three steps: voxel pruning, vector quantization, and post-processing. Voxel pruning removes the least important voxels to reduce model size. An adaptive strategy for pruning threshold selection is introduced, allowing the strategy to be applied to different scenes or base models. Important voxel features are encoded into a compact codebook using an importance-aware vector quantization with an efficient optimization strategy. A joint tuning mechanism is used to enable the compressed models to approach the rendering quality of the original ones. A simple post-processing step is performed to further reduce storage cost. Extensive experiments and empirical studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed compression pipeline on various volumetric methods and scenarios. The results show that the framework achieves a storage reduction of about 100 times over the original grid models, with competitive rendering quality.
