Abstract:Object counting is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to determine the number of objects present in an image. Existing methods mostly focus on counting objects from specific categories, such as humans, cars, animals, or cells. However, these methods can only count a single category at a time. In this paper, we introduce a new task called zero-shot object counting (ZSC), where the user specifies the class to count without providing any annotated exemplars. We propose a two-step method that first localizes class-relevant patches containing the objects of interest based on the given class name and then selects optimal exemplars for counting. To achieve this, we construct a class prototype using a conditional variational autoencoder and select patches that are closest to the prototype. We train a model to measure the goodness of patches based on their corresponding feature maps and use this model to select the final exemplars for counting. Experimental results on the FSC-147 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming previous exemplar-free counting methods. Our contributions include introducing the task of zero-shot object counting, proposing an accurate patch selection method for exemplar-free counting, and verifying the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments and analyses.
