This paper introduces the concept of human-object interaction (HOI) task and its importance in scene understanding. It highlights the deficiencies in current HOI methods, including inflexible prediction manner and insufficient supervised data. The paper proposes a novel approach called OpenCat, which reformulates HOI learning as a language sequence generation problem. This approach allows for open-category prediction and the ability to identify new HOI triplets. The paper also addresses the issue of insufficient labeled HOI data by leveraging weakly supervised or unsupervised data for pre-training. The proposed framework incorporates several auxiliary proxy tasks to enhance visual representation and improve generalization to a wide range of novel HOIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the OpenCat framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on downstream HOI tasks, with larger gains observed under zero-shot and few-shot setups.
