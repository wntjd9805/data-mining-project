Deep neural networks are widely used in various fields, but their practical application in safety-critical areas such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis poses challenges. One specific challenge is the high confidence provided to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples that were not included in the training data. Maximum softmax probability (MSP) score has been proposed to identify these OOD samples, and several approaches have been suggested to improve OOD detection performance. This paper focuses on methods that use auxiliary data as OOD samples, which have shown superior performance compared to methods that only use in-distribution samples. The Outlier Exposure (OE) approach utilizes an auxiliary dataset of outliers and leverages cross-entropy and regularization losses to improve OOD detection. Energy-based OOD detection (EnergyOE) introduces a new energy score and regularization loss. In semantic segmentation, Meta-OOD and PEBAL also employ auxiliary datasets to enhance OOD detection, but existing methods fail to consider variations among the auxiliary data samples, especially on real data like autonomous driving. This paper proposes a balanced energy regularization loss that addresses imbalanced class distributions in auxiliary OOD data. By adjusting the regularization for each sample based on class majority or minority status, the proposed loss achieves better OOD detection performance compared to existing energy regularization methods. The effectiveness of the proposed loss is demonstrated in semantic segmentation, long-tailed image classification, and image classification tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art algorithms. The contributions of this paper include explaining the imbalanced distribution of auxiliary OOD data, proposing a novel balanced energy regularization loss, achieving superior OOD detection performance, and setting new state-of-the-art results in two tasks.
