In this paper, we address the challenges of using lightweight models on devices in real-world scenarios where there are continual distribution shifts. These lightweight models often suffer from poor computational ability and limited generalization ability, hindering their performance in changing environments. To overcome this, we propose a Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation paradigm that leverages the knowledge of large cloud models to enable the lightweight device model to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We introduce an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model that incorporates an Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) strategy and a Visual Prompt Learning Strategy with Uncertainty Guided Updating (VPLU). Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches and can effectively improve the continuous domain adaptation capability of the device model. This paper contributes by introducing a general paradigm for real-world systems and proposing a novel teacher-student model that addresses the challenges of continual adaptation in changing scenarios.
