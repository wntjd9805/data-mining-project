Optical flow estimation is crucial for various computer vision tasks such as video denoising, action recognition, and object tracking. However, it is challenging due to the combination of scene geometry and object motion, making motion estimation an ill-posed problem. Traditional approaches rely on small motion assumptions and prior constraints, but they are limited in handling complex real-life scenes. In contrast, learning-based methods using deep neural networks have shown promise, but their accuracy depends heavily on a good initial solution and suffer from limitations in low-resolution images. To address these issues, we propose AnyFlow, a novel method that is resolution-agnostic and utilizes implicit neural representation (INR) for flow estimation. We introduce a continuous coordinate-based flow upsampler and a novel warping scheme using multi-scale feature maps and dynamic correlation lookup. These techniques enable accurate flow estimation for diverse shapes of input, including low-resolution images. Our experiments demonstrate superior performance, particularly for tiny objects and detail preservation. We also achieve strong generalization across different datasets and rank 1st on the KITTI dataset. Overall, our contributions provide a novel approach for flow estimation in arbitrary image sizes, improving the quality for low-resolution images and extending the applicability for portable devices.
