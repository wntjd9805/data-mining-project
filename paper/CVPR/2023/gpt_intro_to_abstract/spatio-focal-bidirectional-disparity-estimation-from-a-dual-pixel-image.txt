This paper introduces the concept of dual-pixel image sensor technology, which uses two photodiodes per pixel, allowing for more efficient autofocusing. Dual-pixel cameras are now commonly found in various camera platforms and enable not only traditional autofocusing but also a range of RGB-D computational photography applications. This paper discusses the unique characteristics of dual-pixel cameras, including bidirectional disparity and anisotropic blur kernels. It highlights the challenges in estimating bidirectional disparity in dual-pixel imaging and the limitations of current data-driven supervised learning-based methods. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a learning-based bidirectional disparity estimation method specifically designed for dual-pixel imaging. The proposed method involves pretraining a conventional stereo network using a stereo dataset and using a novel self-supervised training approach with a kernel-split symmetry loss. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method through evaluations.
