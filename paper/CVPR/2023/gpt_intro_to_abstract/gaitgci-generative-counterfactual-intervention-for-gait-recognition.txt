Gait recognition, the process of identifying individuals based on their walking patterns, has gained significant attention in recent years. Existing research has primarily focused on analyzing gait patterns in controlled laboratory settings or real-world scenarios. However, current methods often fail to capture the key visual cues of gait patterns near the body boundary, leading to suboptimal attention regions and deteriorated gait representation. This issue arises due to confounders in the network, such as viewpoints or walking conditions, which result in the neglect of important gait-related information. To address this problem, we propose a generative counterfactual intervention framework called GaitGCI, which consists of Counterfactual Intervention Learning (CIL) and Diversity-Constrained Dynamic Convolution (DCDC). CIL leverages counterfactual-based causal inference to mitigate the impact of confounders and focus on regions that reflect gait patterns. DCDC generates factual and counterfactual attention adaptively, ensuring efficiency and representation power. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in various scenarios, and can be used as a plug-and-play module to enhance the performance of existing methods.
