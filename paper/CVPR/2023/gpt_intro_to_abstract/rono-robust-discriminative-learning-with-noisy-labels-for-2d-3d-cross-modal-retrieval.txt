Point-cloud retrieval (PCR) is essential in processing and analyzing 3D data, with applications in robotics, autonomous driving, virtual/augmented reality, and medicine. However, labeling a large amount of 3D point cloud data is expensive and labor-intensive, leading to the introduction of label noise. Existing works heavily rely on well-labeled data, making them vulnerable to noisy labels. Therefore, we propose a robust 2D-3D retrieval framework (RONO) that can learn from noisy multimodal data. RONO consists of two mechanisms: Robust Discriminative Center Learning (RDCL) and Shared Space Consistency Learning (SSCL). RDCL divides noisy data into clean and noisy samples and optimizes them in different directions to alleviate the interference of noisy labels. SSCL bridges the heterogeneity and semantic gaps across different modalities by enforcing modality-invariant representations in the common space and narrowing the gap between the representation space and shared label space. Our framework aims to provide robust point-cloud retrieval in the presence of noisy labels and heterogeneous modalities.
