This paper presents a novel approach for 3D semi-supervised object detection in autonomous driving applications. The dependence on large-scale annotated datasets hinders the deployment of advanced detection models. To address this issue, the paper proposes a hierarchical supervision and shuffle data augmentation (HSSDA) method. The proposed method utilizes the teacher-student model framework, where the teacher network generates pseudo labels for the student network. Instead of using a single threshold strategy, the paper introduces a dual-threshold strategy that divides the pseudo labels into three groups: high-confidence, ambiguous, and low-confidence. This division provides hierarchical supervision signals for the student network. Additionally, the paper proposes a shuffle data augmentation strategy that enhances the feature representation ability of the student network. The method is evaluated through extensive experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in 3D semi-supervised object detection.
