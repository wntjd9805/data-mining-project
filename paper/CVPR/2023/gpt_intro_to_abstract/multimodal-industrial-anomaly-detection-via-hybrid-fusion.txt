Industrial anomaly detection is crucial in ensuring the quality of products. However, acquiring sufficient defect examples for training can be challenging, as they are rare compared to normal examples. Current industrial anomaly detection methods are primarily unsupervised and rely on 2D images. Yet, in industrial quality inspection, human inspectors utilize both 3D shape and color characteristics to identify defects accurately. To address these limitations, we propose M3DM, a novel multimodal anomaly detection scheme based on RGB images and 3D point cloud data. Our approach incorporates a hybrid feature fusion scheme called Unsupervised Feature Fusion (UFF) to reduce the disturbance between multimodal features and encourage feature interaction. We also propose the use of memory banks and a Decision Layer Fusion (DLF) approach to enhance the detection and segmentation precision. Additionally, we explore the feasibility of using Point Transformer and introduce a Point Feature Alignment (PFA) operation to align 3D and 2D features. Experimental results on the MVTec-3D AD dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection and segmentation precision. This research contributes to the advancement of multimodal industrial anomaly detection methods.
