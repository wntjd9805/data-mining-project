Abstract: Point cloud registration is a crucial step in various 3D reconstruction and segmentation tasks. While recent registration methods have focused on pairwise registration of two partial point clouds, multiview registration, which aligns multiple point clouds simultaneously, has received less attention. This paper proposes a method that improves multiview registration in two ways. First, a global feature vector is learned to initialize a sparse pose graph, reducing the outlier ratio and the number of required pairwise registrations. Second, a novel Iterative Reweighting Least Square (IRLS) scheme with a history reweighting function is introduced to improve robustness to outliers. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current multiview registration baselines, with improved registration recall and reduced rotation and translation errors. The method also exhibits strong generalization ability and computation efficiency.
