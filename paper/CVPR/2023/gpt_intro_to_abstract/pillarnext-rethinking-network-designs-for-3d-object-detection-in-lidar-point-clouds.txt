3D object detection in LiDAR point clouds is a crucial task in autonomous driving systems as it provides important information for perception, prediction, and planning. Previous research has focused on developing networks specifically designed for point clouds by adopting grid-based methods. However, these methods are believed to introduce information loss, especially for small objects. Recent research proposes a hybrid design for fine-grained geometrical modeling that combines point and grid-based representations. This paper addresses two fundamental issues in designing a 3D object detection model: the local point aggregator and the network architecture. The computational budget for different local point aggregators is compared, showing that a simple pillar-based model can achieve superior or comparable performance to more complex models, even for small objects. Additionally, the study finds that enlarging the receptive field brings significant improvement in network architectures. By leveraging these findings, a pillar-based network called PillarNeXt is proposed, which achieves state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks. The approach is simple yet effective, scalable, and generalizable, with networks developed for both on-board and off-board applications in autonomous driving. The contributions of this work include the comparison of different local point aggregators, the demonstration of the importance of enlarging the receptive field, and the development of a strong baseline for future research in the field. The code and models are available for further study.
