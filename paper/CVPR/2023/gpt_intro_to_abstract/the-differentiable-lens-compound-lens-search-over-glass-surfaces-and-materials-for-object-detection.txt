In this paper, we present a differentiable lens simulation model and optimization method for optimizing compound lenses specifically for computer vision tasks in automotive object detection. We compare an optimized two-element lens to a baseline lens and find that although the optimized lens has a worse average spot size, it achieves better mean average precision on the BDD100K dataset. We introduce a computationally efficient and differentiable pipeline for simulating and optimizing compound refractive lenses and develop an optimization strategy that encourages manufacturable outcomes. We validate our method by demonstrating consistent improvements in object detection performance when optimizing the lens jointly with the OD model. We release our code and designs in the hope of enabling further joint design applications. However, our method has limitations, such as the need for a high-resolution dataset and the requirement for a suitable lens design starting point.
