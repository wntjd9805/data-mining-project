This paper focuses on the problem of pedestrian detection in real-world scenarios with high crowd density. The current popular approach of using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) for duplicate removal often performs poorly in crowded scenes. Existing methods have attempted to improve NMS, but they lack end-to-end training and easy deployment in industrial applications. The goal of this paper is to establish a fully end-to-end detection pipeline by discarding NMS, specifically by applying an NMS-free technique to a one-stage anchor-free CNN-detector. The paper proposes the Optimal Proposal Learning (OPL) framework, which includes a Coarse-to-Fine (C2F) learning strategy for the classification branch to address the issue of ambiguous positive proposals, and a Completed Proposal Network (CPN) to improve representation ability for hard instances. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Overall, this paper presents a "light and sweet" end-to-end pedestrian detector with potential for practical deployment in industrial applications.
