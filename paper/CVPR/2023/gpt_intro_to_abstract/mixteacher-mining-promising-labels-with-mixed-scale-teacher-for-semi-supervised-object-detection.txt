The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the challenges of collecting large-scale datasets with accurate annotations for deep learning tasks. It highlights the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of manual labeling, especially for tasks like object detection and segmentation. To address these challenges, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has gained attention, which aims to train models using a small amount of labeled images and a large amount of easily accessible unlabeled data.The introduction also mentions that while SSL methods have been extensively studied for image classification, there is a lack of research on semi-supervised object detection. Early studies in this area have adopted SSL methods designed for image classification but overlooked the characteristics of object detection, resulting in a significant performance gap from fully supervised approaches.The authors point out that semi-supervised object detection presents new challenges due to the scale variation of object instances. They mention that existing methods use strict conditions to filter out highly confident pseudo labels, which may result in false negatives, especially for objects with extreme scales. The study also observes that down-sampled images show superiority for detecting large objects compared to regular-scale inputs.The introduction briefly discusses previous methods that have addressed the scale variation issue in semi-supervised object detection by introducing an additional down-sampled view. However, these methods mainly focus on consistency in predictions across scales and still suffer from false negatives caused by inappropriate scales.Based on the limitations of existing methods, the authors propose a new semi-supervised object detection framework called MixTeacher. This framework uses a mixed-scale feature pyramid to adaptively fuse features and improve predictions in the teacher network. They also introduce a method for pseudo labels mining based on the improvement of predictions, aiming to avoid missing object instances due to low confidence scores.The main contributions of this paper are outlined as follows: the proposal of the MixTeacher framework, the introduction of a method for pseudo labels mining, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on MS COCO and Pascal VOC benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings.Overall, this introduction sets the stage for the research problem, highlights the gaps in existing methods, and outlines the proposed solution and contributions of the paper.
