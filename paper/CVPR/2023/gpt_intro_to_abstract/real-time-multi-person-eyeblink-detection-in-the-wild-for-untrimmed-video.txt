Real-time eyeblink detection in the wild is a challenging research area, with potential applications in fatigue detection, face anti-spoofing, and affective analysis. Existing methods focus on single-person cases within trimmed videos, and there is limited attention given to multi-person scenarios within untrimmed videos. However, detecting long-term eyeblink behaviors at a multi-instance level is preferred for certain practical applications, such as estimating attendees' attention level and emotional state during social interaction. Therefore, there is a need for effective and real-time multi-person eyeblink detection in the wild for untrimmed videos.To address this research problem, we present a labeled multi-person eyeblink detection benchmark called MPEblink. This benchmark consists of 686 untrimmed long videos captured from unconstrained movies, showcasing realistic and diverse scenarios, such as social interactions and group activities. MPEblink is the first multi-person eyeblink detection dataset that focuses on in-the-wild long videos. Unlike existing benchmarks, MPEblink aims to be aware of all the attendees throughout the video and detect their eyeblinks at the instance level, making it more challenging and realistic.Previous methods for eyeblink detection employ a sequential approach involving face detection, face tracking, and classification on pre-extracted local eye clues. However, this pipeline has critical drawbacks, including sub-optimal results, inefficiency due to the inability to reuse features, limited information from global face context, unreliable local eye clues, and high computational cost. To overcome these issues, we propose the InstBlink framework, a one-stage multi-person eyeblink detection method that simultaneously detects human faces, tracks them over time, and performs eyeblink detection at the instance level. InstBlink leverages query-based methods and models spatio-temporal face and eyeblink representations at the instance level within each query. This approach allows for effective feature sharing and the utilization of face's global context to improve eyeblink detection in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios.Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of InstBlink, while also highlighting the challenges of real-time multi-person eyeblink detection in the wild for untrimmed videos. The main contributions of this work are the formal definition and exploration of instance-level multi-person eyeblink detection in untrimmed videos, the introduction of the MPEblink dataset, which provides realistic and challenging data, and the proposal of a one-stage multi-person eyeblink detection method that improves effectiveness and efficiency through task-joint optimization.
