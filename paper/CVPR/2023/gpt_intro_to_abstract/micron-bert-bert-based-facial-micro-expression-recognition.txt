Facial expressions play a crucial role in understanding human reactions and have been extensively studied in various application domains. Facial expression problems can be categorized into macro-expressions and micro-expressions based on their intensity and duration. Macro-expressions are spontaneous and recognizable by humans, while micro-expressions are involuntary, low-intensity, and difficult to detect. Identifying micro-expressions is especially important in applications such as lie detection in criminal analysis. Previous work has used high-speed cameras to capture micro-expressions, but there are limitations in terms of accuracy and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called µ-BERT (Facial Micro-expression Recognition via Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers) that utilizes self-supervised learning to accurately identify and localize micro-movements in facial expressions. We also introduce a Diagonal Micro Attention mechanism to precisely identify small movements between consecutive video frames and a Patch of Interest module that efficiently detects micro-expression regions without using facial labels. The proposed µ-BERT framework achieves state-of-the-art results in various micro-expression benchmarks and exhibits high recognition accuracy on new subjects of different characteristics.
