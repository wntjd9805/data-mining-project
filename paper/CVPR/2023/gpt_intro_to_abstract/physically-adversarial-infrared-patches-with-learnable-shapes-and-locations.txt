Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown impressive performance in various vision tasks, but they are known to be susceptible to adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations can mislead the DNNs-based system into making incorrect predictions. Adversarial patches have been successfully used to exploit these vulnerabilities in the physical world. However, existing adversarial patches do not work well with infrared images, which are commonly used in safety-critical applications. This paper proposes a novel method for generating adversarial infrared patches that can effectively deceive infrared object detectors. The method includes a careful design of the patch shape and location, which can be optimized using a gradient-based approach. Experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed adversarial infrared patches in various scenarios, achieving competitive attacking performance while requiring minimal construction time. The method is also generalized to the vehicle detection task, further validating its effectiveness.
