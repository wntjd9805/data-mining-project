This paper addresses the issue of resolution mismatch between display devices and screen content images (SCIs) in multimedia applications. Most existing super-resolution (SR) methods are designed for natural images (NIs) and do not consider the unique characteristics of SCIs, such as discontinuous tone contents. Recently, a transformer-based SCI SR method called implicit transformer super-resolution network (ITSRN) was proposed, which outperforms CNN-based methods but suffers from large model size and slow inference time. Another approach called implicit neural representation (INR) was introduced for single image super-resolution (SISR), but it has a spectral bias towards low-frequency components. The local texture estimator (LTE) was proposed to overcome this bias, but it has a risk of under/overshooting at the discontinuities of SCIs. In this paper, the authors propose a B-spline Texture Coefficients estimator (BTC) that utilizes INR to represent SCIs continuously. BTC predicts scaling, translating, and smoothing parameters of B-splines from the LR image and projects the query point's coordinates into a high-dimensional B-spline representation. This approach achieves better performance with fewer parameters and less memory consumption compared to previous methods. The positive constraint and compact support of B-spline basis functions help preserve discontinuities without under/overshooting, making it robust for reconstructing HR SCIs. The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of BTC for SCI SR, the use of 2D B-spline representation, and the demonstration of its robustness to aliasing.
