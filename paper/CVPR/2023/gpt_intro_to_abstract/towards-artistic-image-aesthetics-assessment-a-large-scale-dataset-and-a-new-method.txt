With the growth of online visual data, image aesthetic assessment (IAA) has become increasingly important in various applications. However, existing datasets related to this task do not meet the requirements of artistic image aesthetic assessment (AIAA). To address this issue, we introduce the Boldbrush Artistic Image Dataset (BAID), the largest AIAA dataset to date, consisting of over 60,000 artworks with more than 360,000 votes. Additionally, we propose a baseline model called the Style-specific Art Assessment Network (SAAN) that effectively exploits style and generic aesthetic features of artworks. SAAN consists of three modules: a Generic Aesthetic Feature Extraction Branch, a Style-specific Aesthetic Feature Extraction Branch, and Spatial Information Fusion. Our contributions include the introduction of the BAID dataset and the development of the SAAN model, which achieves promising results on AIAA metrics.
