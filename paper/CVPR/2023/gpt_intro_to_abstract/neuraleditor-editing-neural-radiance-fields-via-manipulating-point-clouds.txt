The paper introduces NeuralEditor, a flexible and versatile approach for editing neural radiance fields (NeRF) using point clouds. While current NeRF models lack the ability for shape editing, explicit 3D representations like point clouds allow for native shape manipulation. The authors propose a point cloud-guided NeRF model that combines the rendering performance of implicit neural representation with the ease of editing from point clouds. By integrating point clouds into NeRF, shape editing operations can be performed in a consistent way. The authors demonstrate the advantages of NeuralEditor over existing mesh-based NeRF editing methods, such as time efficiency and support for more general scene editing operations. They introduce improvements, such as using K-D trees for constructing density-adaptive voxels and a deterministic integration strategy, to achieve high-fidelity rendering results on deformed scenes. The authors also demonstrate the ability of NeuralEditor to perform smooth scene morphing across multiple scenes. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of NeuralEditor, the proposal of a point cloud-guided NeRF model, the creation of a reproducible benchmark for shape editing, and the investigation of various shape editing tasks. NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance on all shape editing tasks in a unified framework without additional information or supervision.
