This paper introduces the concept of weakly-supervised deep learning for computational pathology (CPATH), which has become a popular approach for modeling whole slide image (WSI) data. The paper discusses the current model development life cycle for achieving clinical-grade machine learning performance and highlights the limitations of task-specific model development. To address these limitations and scale across various tumor types, self-supervised learning is explored to learn patch representations within the WSI. However, supervision is still required for developing the slide classifier, making it challenging for disease types with small sample sizes. The paper proposes a shift from task-specific to task-agnostic model development and explores the use of large-scale pretraining using web-sourced datasets of noisy image-text pairs. The concept of zero-shot transfer is introduced, where a vision encoder pretrained in a task-agnostic fashion can be prompted with text from the label space to perform downstream tasks. While zero-shot transfer has been studied for natural images and certain medical imaging modalities, it has not been explored for pathology. The paper overcomes the challenges associated with pathology WSIs, such as the lack of large-scale paired datasets and computational complexity, and develops the first zero-shot transfer framework for the classification of histopathology whole slide images. The proposed framework, called MI-Zero, is a multiple instance learning-based method that leverages pretrained visual-language encoders and is validated on three real-world cancer subtyping tasks. The paper also conducts several ablation experiments to investigate various factors that enable zero-shot transfer in MI-Zero.
