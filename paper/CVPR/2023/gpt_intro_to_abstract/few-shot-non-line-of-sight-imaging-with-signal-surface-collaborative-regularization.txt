The non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging technique allows for reconstructions of targets that are not in direct line of sight. This technique has various applications, including autonomous driving, remote sensing, rescue operations, and medical imaging. In NLOS imaging, a laser illuminates several points on the visible surface of the target, and the back-scattered light is detected to reconstruct the target. The time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique is commonly used for detection due to the low photon intensity after multiple diffuse reflections. Several methods have been developed for fast reconstructions, including the light cone transform (LCT), directional light cone transform (D-LCT), and phasor field (PF) methods. Deep learning-based methods have also been introduced. Despite these advancements, there is a trade-off between acquisition time and imaging quality. Dense measurements are necessary for high-quality reconstructions, which can take seconds to hours, posing challenges for real-time applications like autonomous driving. Different methods, such as reducing the number of pulses used for illumination, designing array detectors, or incorporating compressed sensing techniques, have been proposed to accelerate the acquisition process. In this paper, we focus on few-shot NLOS detection scenarios and propose a method that deals with a limited number of spatial measurements. We introduce the signal-surface collaborative regularization (SSCR) framework, which works under both confocal and non-confocal settings. We demonstrate the reconstruction of complex geometric targets using only 5x5 confocal measurements, representing a significant acceleration compared to conventional methods.
