Semantic segmentation models are important for scene understanding, but collecting labeled segmentation datasets is time-consuming and costly. To overcome this limitation, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been introduced into semantic segmentation to enable better generalization on unlabeled data. Current SSL methods utilize unlabeled data through consistency regularization, which aims to obtain invariant predictions for unlabeled pixels. However, errors in the pseudo labels used in these methods can misguide the training of models, especially when similar categories are confused. Existing methods focus on improving pseudo label learning, but ignore the semantics of ground truth buried in other unselected labels. To address these issues, this paper proposes Fuzzy Positive Learning (FPL), a new SSL segmentation method that learns informative semantics from multiple probably correct candidate labels called fuzzy positive labels. FPL includes a fuzzy positive assignment algorithm to select which labels should be appended to the fuzzy positive label set of each pixel, and a fuzzy positive regularization technique to learn the semantics of ground truth from these labels. Experimental results show that FPL achieves consistent performance gains on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets compared to baselines. The paper's main contributions include providing a new perspective on SSL segmentation by learning from multiple fuzzy positive labels, proposing methods for adaptive label assignment and exploiting the semantics of ground truth, and demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of FPL in improving existing SSL segmentation methods.
