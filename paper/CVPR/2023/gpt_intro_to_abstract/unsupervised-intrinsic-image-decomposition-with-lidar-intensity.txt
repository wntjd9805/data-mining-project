In this paper, the authors propose an unsupervised approach for intrinsic image decomposition (IID) utilizing LiDAR intensity. IID is the task of decomposing a natural image into an albedo component, which is invariant to illumination, and a shade component, which is variant to illumination. The authors introduce the concept of using LiDAR intensity as a criterion for albedo estimation, as LiDAR intensity represents the proportion of incident light and reflected light. Additionally, they design an intensity consistency loss to address the ill-posed problem of decomposing a single image. To handle the sparsity and occlusion of LiDAR intensity, a LiDAR intensity densification (LID) module is proposed. The authors validate their approach using a dataset that combines RGB images and LiDAR intensities in outdoor scenes. The contributions of this work include the proposal of IID-LI, the design of the intensity consistency loss, the development of the LID module, and the creation of a publicly available dataset for evaluating IID quality with LiDAR intensity. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: related works and baseline methods are discussed in Sec. 2 and Sec. 3, respectively, the proposed method is explained in Sec. 4, experimental details and results are presented in Sec. 5 and Sec. 6, and a summary of the research is provided in Sec. 7.
