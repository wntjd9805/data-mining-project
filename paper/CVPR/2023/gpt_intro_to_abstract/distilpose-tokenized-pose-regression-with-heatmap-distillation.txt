2D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a crucial task in computer vision that involves detecting the anatomical joints of a human in an image and estimating their poses. HPE is often used as a preprocessing step for various downstream tasks such as activity recognition, human motion analysis, and motion capture. In the field of 2D HPE, two main approaches have been explored: heatmap-based and regression-based methods. Heatmap-based methods achieve high accuracy by estimating likelihood heatmaps that explicitly capture spatial information, but they suffer from high computational cost. On the other hand, regression-based methods are faster but less accurate due to the loss of spatial information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called DistilPose that combines the strengths of both approaches. DistilPose includes a knowledge-transferring module called Token-distilling Encoder (TDE) that aligns the feature spaces of heatmap-based and regression-based models. TDE captures the relationship between keypoints and feature maps/other keypoints, allowing for the transfer of heatmap knowledge to regression models. Additionally, we introduce Simulated Heatmaps to provide explicit guidance for regression-based models, including 2D keypoint distributions and confidences. DistilPose achieves comparable performance to heatmap-based models with lower computational cost and outperforms state-of-the-art regression-based methods. Our contributions include the development of DistilPose as the first framework to transfer knowledge between heatmap-based and regression-based models losslessly, the introduction of TDE to bridge the gap between heatmap and coordinate vectors, and the proposal of Simulated Heatmaps to model explicit heatmap information and aid in the learning process. This work has significant implications for improving the efficiency and accuracy of 2D HPE tasks.
