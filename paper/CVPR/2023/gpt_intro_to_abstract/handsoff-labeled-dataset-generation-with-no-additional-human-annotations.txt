Machine learning models heavily rely on large amounts of labeled data for their strong empirical performance. However, the traditional paradigm of training models with human-labeled data is limited by the significant resources required for labeling, especially when the data is difficult to collect. This problem is exacerbated when the labeled data is imbalanced, lacking representation of rare but crucial edge cases. To address these limitations, we propose HandsOff, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based dataset generation framework. HandsOff is trained on a small number of existing labeled images and can produce an infinite set of synthetic images with corresponding labels. By unifying concepts from dataset generation and GAN inversion, HandsOff eliminates the need for new human annotations on synthetically generated images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HandsOff in generating high-quality image-label pairs and in generating semantic segmentation masks, keypoint heatmaps, and depth maps across various challenging domains. Additionally, we show that HandsOff can mitigate the effects of the long-tail problem in semantic segmentation tasks by modifying the distribution of the training data. Overall, HandsOff offers a promising approach for synthesizing labeled datasets in a controlled manner, unlocking new model development paradigms and addressing the limitations of traditional data labeling methods.
