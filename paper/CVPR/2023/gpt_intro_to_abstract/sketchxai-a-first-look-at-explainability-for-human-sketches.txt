The introduction highlights the recent shift towards Explainable AI (XAI) in the vision and language communities. While XAI research has focused on photo and text modalities, this paper aims to explore XAI for human freehand sketches. Sketches are uniquely expressive and can be freely manipulated, making them an ideal basis for explainability. The paper focuses on the unique properties of strokes in sketches and introduces SketchXAINet, a sketch encoder that factors in stroke shape, location, and order. The paper proposes stroke location inversion (SLI) as a task for sketch explainability and presents qualitative results and improved sketch recognition performance. The contributions of the paper include advocating for sketches in XAI, developing SketchXAINet, introducing SLI as a new XAI task for sketches, and providing qualitative results and improved sketch recognition.
