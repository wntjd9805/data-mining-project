Deep learning has made significant advancements in image recognition, but achieving high recognition performance in expert domains, such as biology or medicine, remains challenging. This is due to two main challenges: fine-grained classes with subtle visual differences and the difficulty of producing large annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose a solution called PrOfeSsional lEvel cRowd (POSER) annotation, which leverages crowd-source platforms to provide professional level annotation for expert domain data. We investigate the use of machine teaching algorithms for POSER annotation, where a small teaching set is used to teach crowd-source workers to discriminate between different classes. However, teaching crowd-workers a large number of classes is difficult due to their aversion to complicated training procedures and limited short-term memory. Traditional human-in-the-loop schemes based on active learning also face challenges in the POSER annotation context, as they assume an oracle that produces ground-truth labels, which is not feasible when dealing with noisy annotators. Inspired by semi-supervised learning methods, we propose a pseudo-label filtering approach, where a classifier trained on labeled data produces pseudo-labels for unlabeled examples. These pseudo-labels are then filtered by human annotators, who verify their accuracy based on a support set of positive and negative examples. We refer to this approach as SSL-HF (semi-supervised learning with human filtering). SSL-HF takes advantage of humans' ability for confidence calibration, making the annotation process more accurate compared to SSL alone. We also propose the use of deliberative explanations to assist annotators when differences between support set examples are subtle. Experimental results demonstrate that SSL-HF outperforms other approaches to POSER annotation such as SSL, active learning, and machine teaching. Additionally, explanations further enhance the performance of SSL-HF. To minimize development costs, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on simulated human labeling. Overall, this work establishes a new research direction at the intersection of human-in-the-loop and fine-grained classification, aiming to improve the effectiveness of deep learning in expert domains.
