Multi-agent motion prediction is a crucial task in self-driving systems that involve forecasting the future positions of multiple agents in complex driving environments. Most existing approaches in multi-agent motion prediction focus on predicting a set of marginal trajectories for each agent, which fails to consider explicit agent interactions. This often leads to inconsistent trajectory predictions. To address this, recent research has shifted towards generating joint future trajectory predictions that are consistent with each other. However, predicting joint trajectories becomes exponentially challenging as the number of agents increases. Current approaches either predict joint futures for all agents simultaneously or decompose the joint prediction task for two interacting agents into marginal and conditional predictions. However, these methods are not optimized for large-scale scenarios with numerous interacting agents. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes FJMP (Factorized Joint Motion Prediction), a framework that efficiently generates joint predictions for scenarios with any number of agents by factorizing the joint prediction task into a sequence of marginal and conditional predictions. FJMP models future scene interaction dynamics as a sparse directed interaction graph and uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to prune the graph. Joint future trajectory predictions are then decoded based on the partial ordering of the DAG. The paper validates the proposed method on the multi-agent INTERACTION dataset and the Argoverse 2 dataset, demonstrating its ability to produce scene-consistent joint predictions for up to 50 agents. FJMP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION dataset benchmark and ranks first on the official leaderboard.
