Image recognition techniques developed in the lab often face challenges when being adapted for industrial applications. One significant issue is the disparity between training datasets used in academic research, which are typically balanced, and real-world datasets, which are more likely to be imbalanced. This paper addresses the problem of low per-class recall in long-tailed recognition, where certain classes have significantly lower accuracy than others. While previous methods have focused on improving mean accuracy, this study proposes a novel method that aims to increase the harmonic mean of per-class recall as a more suitable objective. The authors introduce a new loss function that maximizes the geometric mean as a surrogate for minimizing the harmonic mean. Additionally, they propose an ensemble trick that combines pre-trained and fine-tuned models during inference with minimal extra cost. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving both overall accuracy and worst per-class accuracy. The contributions of this work include emphasizing the importance of correct recognition of all categories in long-tailed recognition, introducing a novel method for improving the harmonic mean of per-class recall, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the method through experimentation.
