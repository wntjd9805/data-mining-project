Processing 3D data has become increasingly important in fields like robotics and augmented reality. While computer vision has been successful in processing 2D images, learning from 3D data, such as point clouds, remains challenging due to the increased variations in 3D data. Previous methods have focused on translation equivariance, but this is not sufficient for handling the rotational variations inherent in 3D data. Group-equivariant feature learning has shown promise in addressing this issue, but its broader application is hindered by the need for specialized operations and the high dimensionality of feature maps and convolutions. In this work, we propose E2PN, a convolution structure for processing 3D point clouds that enables SE(3)-equivariance while also being computationally efficient. Our approach achieves this by leveraging a quotient representation and a permutation layer. Experimental results show that our method performs comparably or better than existing equivariant models while reducing computational costs. The code for our implementation is publicly available.
