Temporal action detection (TAD) aims to identify the temporal interval and class label of action instances in untrimmed videos. Existing TAD methods generate action instance candidates through proposal generation using anchor boxes or by directly predicting start and end times of proposals. These methods typically reduce temporal resolution during preprocessing for efficiency, causing quantization error during inference. In this paper, we propose a Global Average Pooling (GAP) method that improves TAD accuracy without algorithmic modification or model retraining. Our experiments show that GAP achieves the best single model accuracy on THUMOS and ActivityNet datasets. Moreover, GAP can be integrated with existing TAD models for further improvement, while enabling lower temporal resolutions for higher inference efficiency with minimal performance degradation. Importantly, GAP can be applied in various learning settings, including supervised, semi-supervised, zero-shot, and few-shot.
