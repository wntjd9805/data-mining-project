The paper introduces the concept of using movie trailers as a source for training automatic video highlight detection algorithms. It highlights the limitations of existing approaches and proposes a new framework called Collaborative Noisy Label Cleaner (CLC) to address these limitations. The CLC framework leverages a scene-segmentation model to obtain movie scene boundaries and uses a multi-modality cleaning mechanism to filter out noisy and incomplete labels. The paper also introduces a new benchmark dataset called MovieLights, which consists of 174 movies with highlight moments from officially released trailers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CLC framework and its significant performance improvement over existing methods. Overall, the paper presents a new approach to movie highlight detection that has the potential to enhance the movie-watching experience for audiences.
