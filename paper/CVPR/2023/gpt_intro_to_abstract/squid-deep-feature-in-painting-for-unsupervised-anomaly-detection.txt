In this paper, we address the problem of anomaly detection in radiography images. Unlike in photographic images, where translation invariance can be assumed, the relative location and orientation of structures are important in radiography imaging. The consistent and recurrent anatomy in radiography images provides an advantage for analysis. We propose a method called SQUID (Space-aware Memory Queues for In-painting and Detecting anomalies) that exploits the consistent anatomical patterns and their spatial information to improve anomaly detection without manual annotation. We formulate the task as an in-painting task, leveraging the anatomical consistency in appearance, position, and layout. Our model dynamically maintains a visual pattern dictionary based on recurrent anatomical patterns, and during inference, it identifies anomalies by discriminating the quality of the in-painting task. We conducted experiments on large-scale radiography imaging datasets and demonstrated the superiority of our method over existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods. We also created a new dataset, DigitAnatomy, to enhance anomaly detection research. Our contributions include the best performing unsupervised anomaly detection method, a synthetic dataset, and overcoming limitations of existing methods through the use of Space-aware Memory Queues and Feature-level In-painting.
