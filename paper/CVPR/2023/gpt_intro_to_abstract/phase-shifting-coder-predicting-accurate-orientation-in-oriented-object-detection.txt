In computer vision, object detection is a fundamental task that has been extensively studied. Early research focused on horizontal object detection, assuming that objects in natural scenes are oriented upward due to gravity. However, in other domains such as aerial images, scene text, and industrial inspection, oriented bounding boxes are considered more preferable. As a result, oriented object detection has gradually gained attention.Currently, one common approach to oriented object detection is to modify horizontal object detectors by adding an output channel to predict the orientation angle. However, this approach faces two problems. The first problem is the boundary problem, which is caused by angular periodicity. The network output can be confused about whether to predict an orientation angle of -π/2 or π/2 for the same input. The second problem is the square-like problem, where a square bounding box cannot be uniquely defined. This inconsistency in angle parameters can also confuse the network.To address these problems, previous research proposed different methods, which will be reviewed in Section 2. However, by rethinking these problems, the authors suggest that they can be unified as rotationally symmetric problems, similar to the periodic fuzzy problem of the absolute phase acquisition in optical measurement.Inspired by this, the authors propose utilizing the phase-shifting coding technique, commonly used in optical measurement, for angle prediction in oriented object detection. This technique has the potential to solve both the boundary discontinuity and square-like problems. Phase-shifting encoding can inherently solve the boundary discontinuity problem by encoding the orientation angle into the periodic phase. Additionally, phase-shifting also addresses the periodic fuzzy problem, similar to the square-like problem, through phase unwrapping techniques.The motivations of this paper are to explore the principle of the phase-shifting angle coder, integrate this module into a deep neural network, and determine if this technique improves the performance of oriented object detection. The contributions of this paper include being the first to utilize the phase-shifting coder for angle regression in the deep learning area, providing a stable solution, and presenting well-written code with reproducible results. The proposed methods are evaluated through extensive experiments on various datasets.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related methods for oriented object detection, Section 3 describes the principles of the phase-shifting coder, Section 4 presents experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
