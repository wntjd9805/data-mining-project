The success of deep learning models in computer vision is attributed to their ability to learn representations for visual patterns. However, the vision community seeks to model and summarize the relationships between observed variables in order to enable predictions on similar data, requiring the high-level ability of causal reasoning. This paper presents a case study on estimating the Overall Survival (OS) time in Primary Liver Cancers (PLC), a challenging task due to the difficulty in predicting OS time at early stages. Previous studies have proposed the use of deep neural networks, but accurate prediction based on only preoperative information remains challenging. To address this, the authors propose a causal inference system that leverages intraoperative information, which is reflective of patient health and postoperative recovery. A new method, Causally-Aware Intraoperative Imputation Model (CAWIM), is presented, incorporating a causal discovery module to estimate intraoperative indexes and a Causally-aware Directed Acyclic Graph (CaDAG) module to learn the causal structure of the indexes. The utility of the proposed method is demonstrated through improved OS time prediction on a liver cancer dataset. The contributions of this work include a new paradigm for OS time prediction, causal structure learning, and better prediction power. This method can be extended to other similar medical tasks.
