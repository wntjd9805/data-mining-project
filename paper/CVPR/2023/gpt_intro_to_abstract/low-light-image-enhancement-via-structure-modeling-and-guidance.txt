The topic of low-light enhancement in computer vision is significant and has broad applications in various fields such as low-light imaging and nighttime detection. Previous methods have focused on optimizing appearance distance between output and ground truth, but have neglected explicit modeling of structural details in dark areas, resulting in blurry outcomes. This paper proposes a framework that utilizes a generative model trained with a GAN loss to perform structure modeling with the form of edges. Additionally, a new mechanism is designed to facilitate the initial low-light appearance enhancement with structure-guided feature synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both PSNR and SSIM metrics on different datasets. The contributions of this work include the introduction of a novel framework for low-light enhancement, a new structure modeling method using GAN loss, a structure-guided enhancement approach, and extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of the framework.
