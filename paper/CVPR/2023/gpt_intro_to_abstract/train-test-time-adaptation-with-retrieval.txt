Deep learning models are evolving rapidly, but machine learning systems used in production are updated infrequently due to the complex processes involved. This paper introduces Test-Time Adaptation with Retrieval (T3AR), a method for performing test-time adaptation by retrieving information from a large, unlabeled, and evolving dataset. T3AR allows users to adapt their models based on data observed at test time, bypassing the time-consuming annotation process. It also enables providers to adapt the production model based on trends observed in test data. T3AR tackles the challenges of unsupervised domain adaptation, semi-supervised learning, open-set domain adaptation, out-of-distribution detection, active learning, and test-time adaptation, combining key ideas and contributions from each field. The method involves selecting relevant samples from an auxiliary dataset using a retrieval model and using a contrastive loss for updating the model based on retrieved samples. Experimental results show that T3AR improves downstream classification accuracy compared to existing methods for train-time and test-time adaptation.
