This paper presents computational techniques for building animatable 3D reconstructions of everyday objects using point cloud videos. The techniques involve identifying object parts, inferring their connectivity, and determining the properties of the joint between each connected part pair. Unlike previous work that focuses on category-specific object articulation, this paper addresses the problem in a category-agnostic manner. The proposed method jointly reasons about part geometries and their inter-connectivity, using a novel continuous-discrete energy formulation. The method first estimates a relaxed model that allows for arbitrary 6DOF trajectories, and then projects it to a kinematic model with 1DOF joints to optimize the joint parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in building rearticulable models for arbitrary everyday objects.
