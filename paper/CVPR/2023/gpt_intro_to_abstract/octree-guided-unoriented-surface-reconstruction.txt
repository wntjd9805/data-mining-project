Surface reconstruction from 3D point clouds is a well-studied problem in computer vision and computer graphics. In this paper, we focus on the reconstruction of watertight 3D shapes, which have well-defined interiors and exteriors. These shapes are often represented using neural fields, specifically signed distance fields (SDFs) or occupancy fields, encoded by neural networks. Neural fields are popular because they can handle arbitrary topology, are memory-efficient, and have infinite resolution.While SDFs are the most popular neural field representation for 3D shapes, they require knowing whether points in space are inside or outside the shape, which is not provided by raw data. Existing methods typically rely on surface normals or signed distances, but these can be noisy and lead to poor results. We address the task of unoriented surface reconstruction, where only the sampled surface points are given and no orientation information is available.To tackle this problem, we propose OG-INR, which combines a discrete octree representation with the continuous implicit neural representation (INR). Given an unoriented point cloud, we build an octree to identify surface leaves and label other leaves as inside or outside the shape. We minimize an energy function that balances the watertight surface property with a minimal surface constraint. We then train INR architectures, guided by the octree labels, and demonstrate faster convergence and improved performance compared to existing methods.Our contributions include introducing a novel method to guide the initial stage of INR training using a labelled octree structure, proposing an energy function over octree labels for surface reconstruction, providing an efficient move-making algorithm for optimizing the energy function, and offering a human-modifiable discrete representation for intuitive modifications to the resulting SDF.
