This paper introduces a novel approach for converting an input graph into a realistic house footprint. Traditional methods rely on convolutional layers, which lack an understanding of long-range dependencies. Recent research has proposed Transformer architectures based on self-attention mechanisms to encode global relations. Additionally, graph convolution networks are effective at exploiting local correlations. To combine these approaches, the paper proposes a graph Transformer generative adversarial network (GTGAN) consisting of a graph Transformer-based generator and a node classification-based discriminator. The generator uses a convolutional message passing neural network and a graph Transformer encoder to capture local and global interactions. The discriminator distinguishes real and fake house layouts while preserving semantic features. The paper also introduces a graph-based cycle-consistency loss to preserve spatial relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that GTGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating house structures. The contributions of the paper include the novel GTGAN framework, the graph Transformer generator, the node classification-based discriminator, and the graph-based cycle-consistency loss.
