Image restoration is an important task in computer vision, with deep learning-based approaches showing remarkable performance. However, most existing approaches focus on known single degradations and cannot handle unknown multiple degradations. Recent research has explored image restoration for known and unknown multiple degradations, but these methods require large networks and heavy computations. This paper proposes an all-in-one image restoration method that combines the advantages of both independent models and unified models. The proposed method utilizes a small number of independent parameters for each degradation task and uses a degradation classifier to adaptively select the appropriate restoration filters. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for diverse combinations of multiple degradations.
