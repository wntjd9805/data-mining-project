Given the increasing volume of videos being generated daily, efficient storage and transfer of videos have become crucial tasks in computer vision and video processing. Although storage costs have decreased, network speeds and I/O processing still pose challenges, making video transfer and processing expensive. Traditional video codecs rely on manually designed encoders and decoders, but deep learning has prompted attempts to replace certain components with neural networks. While these learning-based compression methods show promise in terms of rate-distortion performance, they suffer from complex pipelines and heavy computation. To address these challenges, implicit neural representations have gained popularity due to their simplicity, compactness, and efficiency. Implicit representation methods for video compression simplify the encoding and decoding pipelines by converting video compression problems to model compression problems. However, these methods lack generalizability and fail to provide visual priors in their positional embedding, limiting their regression capacity and the ability to interpolate between frames. This paper proposes a hybrid neural representation for videos called HNeRV, which combines implicit and explicit approaches by storing videos in two parts: content-adaptive frame embeddings and a learned neural decoder. The HNeRV approach improves reconstruction quality, convergence speed, and internal generalization compared to implicit methods. It also offers advantages such as speed, flexibility, and ease of deployment over traditional codecs and prior deep learning approaches. HNeRV is capable of parallel decoding and can be used for video compression and restoration tasks. By compressing the encoder and employing designed HNeRV decoder blocks, the proposed approach remains competitive with state-of-the-art methods. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of HNeRV in video inpainting, showing its robustness to pixel space distortions. Overall, HNeRV offers a hybrid neural representation for videos that improves performance in terms of reconstruction, convergence, speed, and internal generalization, making it a promising candidate for efficient video codec deployment.
