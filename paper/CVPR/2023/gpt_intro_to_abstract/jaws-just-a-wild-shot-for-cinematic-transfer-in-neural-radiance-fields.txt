Film directors and visual artists often draw inspiration from other visual works and pay tribute to them through imitating masterpieces in their own compositions. This practice of visual homage has been prevalent throughout film history, with examples ranging from iconic scenes in movies like "Jaws" to the influence of old-school kung-fu films on contemporary blockbusters like "Kill Bill" and "The Matrix." These visual homages play a crucial role in carrying and adapting cinematic knowledge across different media platforms. However, creating such visual homages is a challenging task that goes beyond replicating camera angles or visual compositions. To achieve a successful cinematic transfer, the visual perception, including visual composition, motion, camera focus, image depth, actions, and lighting, must be similar between the reference and homage clips. In this paper, we propose a cinematic motion transfer technique that focuses on motion characteristics as a solution to this problem. Instead of extracting visual features from the reference clip and recomputing a new clip, we rely on the differentiable nature of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to optimize camera parameters in space and time within the NeRF representation. By leveraging an end-to-end differentiable pipeline, we can directly backpropagate changes to spatial and temporal cinematic parameters. Our approach includes an optical flow estimator to transfer camera directions of motion and a character pose estimator to anchor motions around a target. Furthermore, we utilize guidance maps to improve the transfer of important features. The contributions of our work include the development of a feature-driven cinematic motion transfer technique for NeRF representations, the design of an end-to-end differentiable pipeline for optimizing cinematic parameters, and the proposal of robust cinematic losses combined with guidance maps to ensure effective transfer of on-screen motions and character framing, maintaining the cinematic visual similarity between the reference and generated clips.
