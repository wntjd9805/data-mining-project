This paper focuses on the problem of photon-limited blind deconvolution, which involves recovering the blur kernel and latent clean image from a blurred image with photon-shot noise. Previous approaches for blind deconvolution have been successful in Gaussian noise conditions, but may not perform well in the presence of photon-shot noise. In this paper, we propose a new method called Kernel Trajectory Network (KTN), which models the blur kernel in a low-dimensional and differentiable space by specifying key points of the motion trajectory. By reducing the dimensionality of the kernel estimation problem, our approach achieves substantially better blur kernel estimates in photon-limited scenarios where existing methods fail.
