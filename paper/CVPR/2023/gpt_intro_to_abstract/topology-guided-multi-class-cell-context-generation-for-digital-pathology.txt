Deep learning has greatly improved our ability to analyze digital pathology images. However, there is still a scarcity of annotated images, which limits the prediction power of learning algorithms. One solution is to train generative models that can generate realistic pathology images to augment the existing data. In the generation of pathology images, the spatial layout of cells and the filling in of stains and textures are two important steps. Existing methods often focus only on the second step, neglecting the rich spatial context that carries critical information about cancer biology. The spatial context includes the distribution of different cell types and the formation of structural patterns. Spatial context has been shown to be clinically significant in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Therefore, we propose a deep generative model that incorporates mathematical constructs, such as the K-function from spatial statistics and the theory of persistent homology, to model and generate the spatial distribution of multi-class cells and their structural patterns. We introduce a novel cell configuration loss that compares the generated and reference cell configurations based on persistent homology and spatial statistics. This loss enforces the expected spatial characteristics and ensures that holes in the generated cell configuration match the holes in the reference configuration in terms of shape, density, and cell type composition. By generating the cell spatial configuration, we can also generate the nuclei mask, staining, and texture. Our experiments show that the generated cell layouts have similar spatial and structural characteristics as the reference layouts, unlike previous methods using randomly generated masks. We demonstrate the efficacy of the augmented images in downstream tasks such as cell classification. Overall, our contributions include the first generative model to learn cell spatial context from pathology images, the introduction of multi-class spatial context descriptors based on spatial statistics and topology, the proposal of a novel cell configuration loss function, and the demonstration of the usefulness of the augmented images in various tasks. By modeling cell spatial context, we can better understand and quantify the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment and correlate it with genomics and clinical outcomes.
