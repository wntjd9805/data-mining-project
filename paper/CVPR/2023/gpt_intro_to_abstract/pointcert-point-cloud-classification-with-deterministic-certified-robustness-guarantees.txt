Point cloud classification is crucial in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, studies have shown that point cloud classification is vulnerable to adversarial point clouds, where attackers can manipulate a small number of points to misclassify the point cloud. Existing defenses against adversarial point clouds can be categorized into empirical defenses and certified defenses. Empirical defenses lack formal guarantees and are often broken by advanced attacks, while certified defenses provide probabilistic guarantees. In this work, we propose PointCert, the first certified defense with deterministic robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds. PointCert transforms a base point cloud classifier to be certifiably robust by dividing the point cloud into sub-point clouds and predicting labels for each sub-cloud, taking a majority vote as the predicted label. We prove that PointCert predicts the same label when the perturbation size is below a threshold. We consider three scenarios for applying PointCert and propose methods to optimize its performance. Our experiments show that PointCert outperforms state-of-the-art certified defenses, achieving a certified accuracy of 79% on the ModelNet40 dataset. Our contributions include the proposal of PointCert, methods to optimize its performance, and extensive evaluation and comparison with existing defenses.
