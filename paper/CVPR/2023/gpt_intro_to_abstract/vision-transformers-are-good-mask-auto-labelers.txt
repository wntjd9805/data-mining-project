Abstract:Computer vision has made significant advancements in tasks such as instance segmentation, which involves localizing and segmenting objects with high accuracy. However, these tasks heavily rely on human mask annotations, which are time-consuming to create and prone to errors. Moreover, large-scale detection datasets often lack instance segmentation labels due to the cost and difficulty of creating high-quality annotations.To overcome these limitations, there is growing interest in box-supervised instance segmentation, where object masks are predicted directly from bounding box supervision. Recent methods in this area have shown promising results, challenging the belief that mask annotations are necessary for training instance segmentation models. However, there is still a gap in performance between state-of-the-art approaches and fully supervised methods.In this paper, we propose a two-phase framework for box-supervised instance segmentation. The framework includes a mask auto-labeling phase and an instance segmentation training phase. We introduce a Transformer-based mask auto-labeling framework called Mask Auto-Labeler (MAL), which takes Region-of-interest (RoI) images as inputs. Our approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of box-supervised instance segmentation.Through experiments and evaluations, we show the effectiveness of our framework in producing high-quality instance segmentation results using only bounding box supervision. Our approach bridges the gap between state-of-the-art methods and fully supervised approaches, providing a promising solution for reducing the reliance on costly and time-consuming human mask annotations in computer vision tasks.
