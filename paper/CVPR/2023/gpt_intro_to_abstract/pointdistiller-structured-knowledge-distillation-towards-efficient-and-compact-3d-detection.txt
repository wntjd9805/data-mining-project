This paper discusses the discrepancy between cumbersome 3D object detectors and lightweight detectors for real-time applications on edge devices. To address this problem, model compression techniques, such as knowledge distillation, have been proposed. Knowledge distillation involves training a lightweight student model to mimic a pre-trained teacher model. While knowledge distillation has been effective in image-based tasks, point clouds present unique challenges due to their lack of topological information and irregular distribution. This paper proposes a local distillation method that encodes the local geometric structure of point clouds and a reweighted learning strategy to handle sparsity and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over previous knowledge distillation methods.
