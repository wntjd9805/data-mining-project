Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) aims to train object detectors using both labeled and unlabeled data. The current practice involves training a teacher model on labeled data and generating pseudo labels on unlabeled data for the student model. However, the inconsistency in pseudo-targets hinders the performance of SSOD, leading to overfitting and inaccurate predictions. Additionally, the static criteria for assigning pseudo-labels to anchors are sensitive to noise, resulting in severe overfitting. This study proposes a method called Consistent-Teacher to address these issues. It introduces cost-aware adaptive sample assignment to align pseudo-bboxes with anchor predictions and improve training stability. Furthermore, a 3-D feature alignment module is developed to calibrate classification and regression tasks and produce consistent pseudo-bboxes. An adaptive threshold scheme using Gaussian Mixture Model is employed to stabilize the number of positive samples. The proposed Consistent-Teacher outperforms existing SSOD methods and achieves significant improvement in detection accuracy. This paper provides in-depth investigation, new techniques, and solid baseline for SSOD.
