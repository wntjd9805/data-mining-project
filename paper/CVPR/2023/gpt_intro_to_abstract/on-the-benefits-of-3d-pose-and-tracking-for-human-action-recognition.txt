This paper introduces the Lagrangian Action Recognition with Tracking (LART) approach for human action understanding. The Lagrangian viewpoint focuses on tracking trajectories of people over time, utilizing 3D pose representations and tracklet trajectories. The proposed method combines this Lagrangian viewpoint with traditional baselines that rely on appearance and context from the video, achieving significant improvements in action recognition. The system outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on the AVA v2.2 dataset by a large margin. The effects of tracking and 3D poses are highlighted, demonstrating their importance in human action understanding.
