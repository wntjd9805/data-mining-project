In recent years, learning-based image denoising methods have achieved great success in pairwise training samples. However, recovering high-quality results in extreme low-light scenarios remains challenging due to limited data. One alternative solution is noise modeling, which simulates noises that match the extreme low-light distribution. Physics-based methods build statistical models based on the physical process from photons to digital signals, but their calibration requires a large number of frames, which is laborious and expensive. Learning-based methods, on the other hand, directly learn the mapping from clean images to noisy counterparts, but their performance is still inferior to physics-based methods. This inferiority is due to the inconsistency between the noise models and the imaging process, as well as the entanglement of different noise sources. This paper proposes a refined noise model that covers various common noise types in the imaging process and better considers ISO dependence. The noise model is implemented in the normalizing flow framework, which allows for accurate distribution modeling. Additionally, a low-light image denoising (LLD) dataset is collected, and the noise model is trained in a two-stage manner. The proposed noise model and dataset contribute to better understanding and performance in extreme low-light image denoising.
