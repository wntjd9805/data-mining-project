This paper focuses on two main problems in the field of 3D vision: the absence of a generic dataset comparable to ImageNet in 2D vision, and the unknown benefits that such a dataset could provide. The authors propose the creation of a new dataset, MVImgNet, which consists of 6.5 million frames from 219,188 videos capturing real-life objects from 238 classes, along with rich annotations. This dataset leverages multi-view images to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D and provide natural 3D visual signals. The authors also conduct several pilot experiments to explore the potential of MVImgNet, demonstrating its benefits in view-based 3D reconstruction, general image classification, and salient object detection. Additionally, the authors introduce a derived dataset called MVPNet, which consists of 87,200 point clouds with class labels, further contributing to the field of 3D object classification and point cloud understanding. Both MVImgNet and MVPNet will be made public to facilitate further research and inspire the broader vision community.
