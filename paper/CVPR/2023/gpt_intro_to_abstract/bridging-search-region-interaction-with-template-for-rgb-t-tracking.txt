Single object tracking (SOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to localize a target object in successive frames. However, current SOT methods that rely on RGB data are vulnerable under extreme imaging conditions. To address this issue, the incorporation of thermal infrared (TIR) data for mutual enhancement and complement has been proposed. The key to effective RGB-T tracking is effective cross-modal interaction between RGB and TIR modalities. Existing methods either concatenate features from the whole RGB and TIR search frames or conduct fusion operations on sampled candidate boxes (RoIs) from the search frames, but they often introduce noise or lack global context modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that utilizes target templates as the medium to bridge cross-modal interaction. This scheme leverages the original multimodal information of the target object in the templates to guide the extraction of target-relevant context from search regions, enabling adaptive and precise information enhancement and complement. To implement this scheme, we design a Template-Bridged Search region Interaction (TBSI) module that fuses RGB and TIR templates, employs cross-attention mechanism for context aggregation, and updates the templates with enriched multimodal contexts gathered from search regions. We extend the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to RGB-T tracking with the TBSI module, achieving improved performance on popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks. Our contributions include the novel TBSI module, the integration of TBSI with ViT for RGB-T tracking, and the state-of-the-art performance achieved on RGB-T tracking benchmarks.
