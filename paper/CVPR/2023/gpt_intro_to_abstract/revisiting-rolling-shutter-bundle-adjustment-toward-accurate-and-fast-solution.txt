Bundle adjustment (BA) is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision that involves refining the relative pose of cameras and the coordinates of observed points in a scene. This is achieved by minimizing the reprojection errors over multiple images and points. BA has been widely used in two important applications, namely structure-from-motion (SfM) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In recent years, the use of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras with rolling shutters (RS) has become prevalent due to their lower cost, reduced energy consumption, and higher frame rates. However, RS cameras capture images in a scanline-by-scanline manner, resulting in distortions known as the RS effect. These distortions pose significant challenges in various computer vision tasks, including pose estimation and bundle adjustment.Handling the RS effect in bundle adjustment is crucial for extracting accurate 3D information from RS camera images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called NW-RSBA, which addresses the RS effect and improves the performance of traditional BA algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using the TUM-RSVI dataset and compare it with existing methods such as classical Orb-SLAM and NM-RSBA.Overall, our work highlights the importance of addressing the RS effect in bundle adjustment and presents a novel solution that improves the accuracy and reliability of 3D computer vision applications.
