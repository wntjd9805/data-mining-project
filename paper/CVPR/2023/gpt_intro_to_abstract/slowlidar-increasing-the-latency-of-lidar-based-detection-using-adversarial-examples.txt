The development of self-driving platforms has led to extensive research on autonomous transit. A crucial feature of these platforms is the use of LiDAR-based perceptual pipelines for tasks such as localization and object detection. Ensuring the robustness of these pipelines is essential for the safety of autonomous vehicles, as errors in perception can result in crashes. Previous research has primarily focused on the accuracy of perceptual prediction, neglecting real-time performance. Therefore, this paper presents the first systematic analysis of the impact of adversarial point cloud perturbations on the runtime latency of LiDAR perceptual pipelines. The authors propose SlowLiDAR, an algorithmic framework for adding adversarial perturbations to point cloud data with the aim of increasing the execution time of LiDAR-based object detection. The paper addresses three technical challenges: the non-differentiability of the aggregation operation, the need for a novel loss function to capture the impact on runtime latency, and the large search space for optimization. The authors overcome these challenges by developing a differentiable proxy for non-differentiable pre-processing pipelines, designing a novel loss function, and proposing a probing algorithm to find high-quality initialization for attack optimization. The effectiveness of SlowLiDAR is evaluated on six LiDAR detection frameworks, demonstrating the ability to significantly increase latency while maintaining imperceptibility. This paper contributes by analyzing the attack surface of LiDAR detection models, proposing adversarial attacks to increase runtime latency, and evaluating the attacks on various hardware and implementations.
