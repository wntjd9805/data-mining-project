3D face reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics, aiming to estimate realistic 3D face shapes and appearances from 2D images. This has important applications in face manipulation, speech-driven facial animation, and video conferencing. While monocular face reconstruction methods have made significant progress, the reconstruction of fine-grained albedo remains a challenge. Existing methods have attempted to address this by creating texture models or introducing lighting constraints, but they often bias light-colored albedos, leading to unfair representation for different ages and races. To address this, the TRUST method introduced a balanced albedo model and estimated environment lighting, but it is still vulnerable in complex scenarios and facial appearance variations.In this work, we propose a novel ID2Albedo method to achieve illumination-robust albedo estimation. We train a high-resolution albedo generator using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and use illumination-robust identity features to predict latent codes for albedo map reconstruction. We also incorporate facial attribute constraints, considering that facial albedo is related to attributes such as ethnicity, age, and skin color. To overcome the lack of diverse attribute-labeled face datasets, we utilize the CLIP visual-textual model to provide semantic cues for individual faces. We propose a semantic loss based on pseudo attribute labels, comparing attribute differences between the reconstructed face and the original input face.We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the FAIR benchmark and real-world images, and the results show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially under various lighting conditions. Our contributions include training a high-resolution albedo generator, utilizing face identification features for albedo prediction, and incorporating visual-textual cues to overcome the illumination/albedo ambiguity problem. Our method improves the accuracy and fairness of facial albedo estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
