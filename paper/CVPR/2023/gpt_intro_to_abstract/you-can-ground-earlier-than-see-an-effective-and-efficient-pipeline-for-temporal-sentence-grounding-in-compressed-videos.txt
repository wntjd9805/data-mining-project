Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a challenging computer vision task that has gained attention for its applications in video understanding and temporal action localization. Previous TSG methods rely on fully decompressing videos and annotating individual frames, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this, we propose the novel task of compressed-domain TSG, which leverages the compressed video instead. We introduce a framework called Three-branch Compressed-domain Spatial-temporal Fusion (TCSF) that extracts visual features from I-frames and P-frames to capture appearance and motion information. We also design spatial and temporal attention mechanisms and an adaptive fusion module to integrate the features. Our experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TCSF in compressed-domain TSG.
