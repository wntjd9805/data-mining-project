Modern object detectors have achieved impressive results, but their performance decreases when faced with test data that differs from the training distribution. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a standard strategy to address this issue, considering the difficulty and cost of acquiring annotated data in the test domain. Previous work has focused on learning domain invariant features, but most efforts have been directed towards addressing appearance changes rather than geometric shifts. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation approach that specifically targets geometric shifts in object detection. We model geometric transformations as combinations of multiple homographies and design an aggregator block to incorporate this capability into the detector. By generating pseudo labels for the target domain, we optimize the homographies to reduce the geometric shift. Our contributions include tackling general geometric shifts, learning homographies using unlabeled target data, and generalizing to a broad class of geometric transformations. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios, including FoV shifts and adapting to different camera viewpoints in pedestrian detection. Our method outperforms previous approaches without requiring prior camera information. The implementation of our approach can be accessed at https://github.com/vidit09/geoshift.
