This paper addresses the problem of object-centric understanding in computer vision and introduces UNINEXT, a unified instance perception model. The paper discusses 10 sub-tasks in object-centric understanding, including object detection, instance segmentation, multiple object tracking, and video instance segmentation. It highlights the drawbacks of current fragmented approaches and proposes a unified prompt-guided formulation to solve all the tasks. UNINEXT uses a prompt generation module and an early fusion module to handle different prompt modalities. A Transformer-based object detector is used as the instance decoder, allowing flexible retrieval of matched objects. The paper demonstrates that UNINEXT achieves superior performance on multiple benchmarks and provides strong generic representations for instance perception tasks. The contributions of the paper include the unified formulation, the flexibility to handle different tasks and domains, and the superior performance achieved by UNINEXT.
