Time-of-Flight (ToF) imaging has become a key technology in modern 3D imaging, with applications in various fields such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, and robotics. ToF cameras can be categorized into direct and indirect systems, with the latter being more cost-effective and widely used. However, indirect ToF imaging faces limitations, especially in the presence of scattering media like fog, which leads to inaccuracies in depth estimation. In this paper, we propose a polarimetric ToF imaging method that addresses the challenges posed by scattering environments. We leverage the polarization property of light and develop a computational method to eliminate the effects of unpolarized backscattered light. Our method significantly improves depth accuracy, making it suitable for applications in challenging environments like foggy conditions. Our contributions include a scattering-aware polarimetric phasor model and an efficient scattering phasor optimization technique. Overall, our method offers a robust solution for depth estimation through scattering media, surpassing existing baselines.
