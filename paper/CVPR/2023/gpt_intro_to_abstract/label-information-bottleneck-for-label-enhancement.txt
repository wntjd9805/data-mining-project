Learning with label ambiguity is crucial in computer vision and machine learning. Label Distribution Learning (LDL) is a learning paradigm that considers the relative importance of different labels and addresses label ambiguity by annotating instances with a label distribution. LDL is a more general framework compared to traditional Multi-Label Learning (MLL), which uses multiple logical labels for annotation. While many LDL methods have achieved success, annotating instances with label distributions is time-consuming. Label Enhancement (LE) is a promising solution that aims to recover desired label distributions from existing logical labels. Several LE methods have been proposed to recover label distributions, given a dataset with logical labels. In this paper, we propose a novel LE method called Label Information Bottleneck (LIB) that utilizes the Information Bottleneck concept to explore label assignments and label gaps between label distributions and logical labels. LIB decomposes label relevant information into these two components, enabling enhanced recovery of label distributions. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIB compared to state-of-the-art LE methods.
