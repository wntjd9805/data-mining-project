This paper presents a domain generalization method, DG-BEV, for multi-view 3D object detection in Bird-Eye-View (BEV). Existing detectors assume training and testing data are from the same domain, which is unrealistic. When the domain of the input image shifts, performance degradation occurs. This paper analyzes the causes of the domain gap in MV3D-Det and proposes DG-BEV to address this issue. DG-BEV combines homography learning to dynamically adjust the imagery data and camera pose, and the construction of multiple pseudo-domains using adversarial training. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of DG-BEV, making it the first systematic study in domain generalization for multi-view 3D object detectors.
