The research paper focuses on the problem of single image reflection removal (SIRR) in low-level image processing. The SIRR aims at recovering a clear transmission image by removing the reflection layer from an image taken through a transparent surface. Traditional methods for SIRR often rely on manual priors, but they may be violated in complex scenes. Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown better performance in recovering clear images. However, deep neural networks are vulnerable to visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations, which can significantly affect the prediction of the SIRR models. This paper investigates the robustness of deep SIRR methods against adversarial attacks and proposes a new robust SIRR model based on the image transformer. The proposed model integrates cross-scale attention, multi-scale fusion, and adversarial image discrimination techniques to enhance its robustness against adversarial attacks. The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of existing deep SIRR methods and analyzes the robustness of the proposed model through extensive experiments. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art stability against adversarial images while maintaining favorable accuracy on clean images.
