The estimation of dense correspondences in computer vision, such as scene flow, optical flow, and disparity, is essential for various applications. However, existing datasets and benchmarks have limitations in terms of high-quality data, large frame numbers, and fine detail evaluation. In this paper, we propose the Spring dataset and benchmark, which includes 6000 stereo image pairs with high-quality visuals and ground truth data. We also introduce a novel evaluation methodology and a public benchmark website for comparing methods. Additionally, we evaluate 15 state-of-the-art methods as baselines, showing the challenges in handling small details and the potential for improvement in these tasks.
