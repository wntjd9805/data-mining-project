Video frame interpolation (VFI) is a popular technique used to increase the frame rate of a video by interpolating intermediate frames. It has various applications, such as video enhancement, compression, slow-motion generation, and view synthesis. Many VFI methods have been developed, particularly those based on motion estimation, which have shown impressive performance. However, interpolating high-resolution videos, such as 4K videos, remains a challenge due to factors like large motions and small objects that hinder accurate motion estimation. Most existing VFI methods are optimized for low-resolution datasets and perform poorly on 4K videos. This paper aims to address this limitation by proposing a novel 4K VFI algorithm called BiFormer that utilizes the bilateral transformer based on bilateral cross attention. The algorithm estimates global motion fields at a coarse scale using BiFormer and refines them at a fine scale using a motion upsampler. The final motion fields are then used to warp and blend the input frames to synthesize an intermediate frame. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed BiFormer algorithm on 4K benchmark datasets. The major contributions of this work include the development of the first transformer-based bilateral motion estimator, the utilization of blockwise bilateral cost volumes for efficient motion field refinement at 4K resolution, and the outperformance of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art VFI methods on three 4K benchmark datasets.
