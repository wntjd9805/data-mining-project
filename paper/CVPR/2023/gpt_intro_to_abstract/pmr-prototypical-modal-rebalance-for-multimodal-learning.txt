Multimodal learning (MML) is a technique that aims to mimic the way humans perceive the world by combining multiple sensory channels to better understand the external environment. It has gained extensive attention in various scenarios, such as video classification, event localization, action recognition, and audiovisual speech recognition. While MML has the potential to achieve better performance than using a single modality, the heterogeneity of multimodal data poses challenges in learning multimodal correlations and complementarities.Recent research has shown that although the overall performance of multimodal learning exceeds that of single-modal learning, the performance of each modality tends to be far from their upper bound. This is due to the "modality imbalance" problem, where the dominant modality hinders the full utilization of multimodal information. Different modalities also have inconsistent learning efficiency, as they overfit and converge at different rates.Several methods have been proposed to address the modality imbalance problem, but they either introduce additional model structures or are limited by specific fusion methods, which restrict their application scenarios. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces the Prototypical Modal Rebalance (PMR) strategy, which stimulates the slow-learning modality by promoting feature exploitation and alleviates the suppression from the dominant modality by slowing it down in the early training stage.The PMR strategy utilizes prototypes, defined as representative embeddings of instances of a class, for each modality. Non-parametric classifiers are constructed using the prototypes to evaluate the performance of each modality. A prototype-based metric is designed to monitor the modality imbalance degree during training. The prototypical cross-entropy (PCE) loss is proposed to accelerate the slow-learning modality by enhancing its clustering process, while a prototypical entropy regularization (PER) term is introduced to penalize the dominant modality and prevent premature convergence.Experiments demonstrate that PMR outperforms existing methods and has strong generality. It achieves considerable improvements, independent of fusion methods or model structures. The contributions of this paper include the analysis of the modal imbalance problem, the proposal of the PMR strategy to address this problem through PCE loss and PER, and comprehensive experiments that illustrate the advantages and generality of PMR.
