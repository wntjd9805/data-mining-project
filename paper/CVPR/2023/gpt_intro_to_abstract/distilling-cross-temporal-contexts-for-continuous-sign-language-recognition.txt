Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) and the limitation of the temporal aggregation module in the baseline framework. The authors propose a cross-temporal context aggregation (CTCA) method that incorporates local-global temporal contexts and linguistic prior to overcome this limitation. The CTCA method includes a dual-path network with separate local and global perception modules and a parallel linguistic module. A cross-context knowledge distillation loss function is used to transfer the local temporal context and linguistic prior to the global perception module. Experimental results show that the CTCA method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of word error rate, test time, and model size.
