In this paper, the authors propose a method to decompose reflections on glossy objects and use them to construct a 5D environment radiance field surrounding the object. By modeling the object's surface as a virtual sensor, they are able to capture depth and radiance information from the object's reflections. This approach enables beyond field-of-view novel-view synthesis, allowing for the rendering of views that are only visible through the object's reflections. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through experiments and show that it can be used to estimate object geometry, diffuse radiance, and the environment radiance field. They also discuss the limitations of their approach and suggest potential extensions and improvements. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach for capturing and analyzing the 3D world from the perspective of glossy objects.
