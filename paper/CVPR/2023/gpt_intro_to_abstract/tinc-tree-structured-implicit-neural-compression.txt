Abstract:The advent of the big data era has resulted in a vast and continuously expanding amount of visual data in various fields. Efficient compression techniques are needed to address the challenges of data storage, sharing, and transmission. While image and video compression methods have been extensively studied and widely utilized, the compression of medical and biological data remains a challenge. Implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful tool for scene rendering, shape estimation, and dynamics modeling. However, INR-based compression is limited when dealing with large-sized data due to its intrinsic limited spectrum coverage. Previous works have attempted to address this limitation but still struggle with representation accuracy and blocking artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a tree-structured Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) approach, named TINC (Tree-structured Implicit Neural Compression), which utilizes an ensemble learning and divide-and-conquer strategy to compress different regions separately. These MLPs are organized hierarchically to extract shared parameters, taking into account the similarity and proximity of spatially adjacent regions. Our experiments demonstrate that TINC significantly improves the performance of INR and outperforms commercial compression tools under high compression ratios, particularly in the context of diverse biomedical data. Additionally, TINC serves as a flexible framework that can be adapted to various data types and settings.
