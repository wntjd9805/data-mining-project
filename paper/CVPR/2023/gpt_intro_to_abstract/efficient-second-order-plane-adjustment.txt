This paper focuses on solving the plane adjustment (PA) problem efficiently for 3D reconstruction using depth sensors. The PA problem involves jointly optimizing 3D structures and sensor poses, similar to the well-studied bundle adjustment (BA) problem. However, the PA problem can eliminate planes, reducing the number of variables in the cost function. Although previous works have attempted to compute the Hessian matrix and gradient vector for the PA problem, no efficient solution has been proposed. This paper presents an efficient PA solution using Newton's method. The authors derive a closed-form solution for the Hessian matrix and gradient vector, which has a computational complexity independent of the number of points on the planes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges faster than state-of-the-art algorithms.
