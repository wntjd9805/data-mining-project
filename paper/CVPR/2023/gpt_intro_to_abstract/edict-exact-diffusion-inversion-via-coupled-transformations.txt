This paper introduces the concept of Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT) as a solution to the problem of image editing using Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs). While previous methods have explored the use of DDMs for image editing, the goal of editing any real or artificial image using purely text is still an active area of research. The authors diagnose the limitations of existing inversion methods and propose EDICT as a re-formulation of the DDIM process inspired by coupling layers in normalizing flow models. EDICT enables the recovery of the original noise vector in the case of model-generated images and guarantees that initial noise vectors map to the original image when the generative process is run. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EDICT in recovering complex image features and performing complex edits or transformations to real images using textual guidance. Unlike other methods, EDICT does not require specialized training or finetuning and can be combined with any pretrained DDM.
