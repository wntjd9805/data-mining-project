Compressive sensing (CS) is a popular research area in signal/image processing, which involves joint acquisition and reconstruction. This approach allows for the reconstruction of the original signal using far fewer measurements than traditionally required by the Nyquist sampling rate. The two main concerns in CS are the design of the sampling matrix and the recovery of the original signal. This paper focuses on the latter, aiming to improve the reconstruction process. CS technology has achieved great success in various image systems, including medical imaging, single-pixel cameras, wireless remote monitoring, and snapshot compressive imaging. Mathematically, CS reconstruction is an ill-posed inverse problem, and traditional CS methods commonly solve an energy function to obtain a reliable reconstruction. Traditional model-based methods use pre-defined transform bases such as DCT and wavelet, while network-based methods leverage the learning capacity of deep networks. However, most network-based methods lack interpretability and do not fully consider the advantages of traditional algorithms. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight Optimization-inspired Cross-attention Transformer (OCT) module as an iterative process for efficient image CS. The OCT module consists of a Dual Cross Attention (Dual-CA) sub-module, which includes an Inertia-Supplied Cross Attention (ISCA) block and a Projection-Guided Cross Attention (PGCA) block. The proposed OCTUF framework outperforms state-of-the-art CS methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: - We propose a lightweight OCTUF framework for CS, where the OCT module serves as the iterative process in feature space. - We design a compact Dual-CA sub-module to facilitate efficient multi-channel information interactions, incorporating a PGCA block and an ISCA block. - Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OCTUF over existing methods in terms of computational and memory costs.
