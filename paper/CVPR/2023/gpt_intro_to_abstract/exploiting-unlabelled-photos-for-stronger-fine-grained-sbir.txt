The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the significance of sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) and the recent shift to a "fine-grained" setting. It highlights the limitations of existing FG-SBIR models and proposes two contributions to address these issues. Firstly, the paper introduces an intra-modal triplet objective in both sketch and photo modalities to enforce better separation among instances. Secondly, it suggests leveraging unlabelled photos through knowledge distillation to overcome sketch data scarcity. A novel distillation token is introduced into the model architecture to facilitate better distillation. Additionally, the paper addresses the instability of standard triplet loss training and draws inspiration from stabilizing GAN training to propose a solution using Exponential Moving Average. Overall, the paper presents a strong baseline for FG-SBIR, surpassing prior arts by approximately 10%, and demonstrates its effectiveness in generalizing to new classes without paired sketches.
