In this paper, we explore the use of thermal data as a novel sensor modality for analyzing past human behavior. Thermal images, captured by infrared cameras, provide valuable information about where and what has happened in a scene. We propose to develop a system that can generate several possible poses of a person N seconds ago given an indoor thermal image with a human in it. To achieve this, we collect a Thermal Indoor Motion dataset and design a three-stage model for past human pose estimation. Our experiments show that our method is able to generate plausible past poses based on thermal cues, outperforming RGB-only methods. Additionally, our model discovers the correlation between thermal mark intensity and time. Our contributions include the introduction of the novel task of past human motion estimation using thermal footprints, the construction of the Thermal-IM dataset, and the proposal of an effective three-stage model for inferring past human motion from thermal images.
