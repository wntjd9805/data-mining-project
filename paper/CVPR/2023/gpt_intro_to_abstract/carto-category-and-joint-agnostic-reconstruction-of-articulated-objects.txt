Reconstructing 3D shapes and inferring the 6D pose and sizes of objects from partially observed input observations is a challenging problem in computer vision. This problem has applications in Robotics and AR/VR. Previous work has shown that category-level 3D shape reconstruction and 6D pose estimation can be performed in real-time, but there are limitations when it comes to objects with articulated shapes. There has been progress in articulated object tracking and reconstruction from a sequence of observations, but this approach is cumbersome and requires prior interaction with the environment. In contrast, object reconstruction from a single stereo image through inferring latent information about an object a priori enables grasping and manipulation of previously unknown articulated objects. The goal of this paper is to present a single-shot approach called "Category and Joint Agnostic Reconstruction of ARTiculated Objects" (CARTO) that can output complete 3D information, including shape, pose, and sizes of multiple objects, in a per-pixel manner. CARTO achieves this by training a category- and joint-agnostic 3D decoder that learns disentangled latent shape and joint codes. The shape code encodes the canonical shape of the object, while the joint code captures the articulation state of the object. By combining this decoder with a stereo RGB image encoder, CARTO can infer the spatial centers, 6D poses, sizes, shape codes, and joint codes of detected objects. These codes can then be used to reconstruct the objects. The authors of this paper evaluate CARTO by comparing its reconstruction and articulation state prediction quality against decoders trained on a single category. They also compare CARTO to a two-stage approach on synthetic data and provide qualitative results on a new real-world dataset. The main contributions of this paper are the approach for learning a shape and joint decoder in a category- and joint-agnostic manner, the single-shot method for predicting 3D shapes, 6D poses, and articulation information, the large-scale synthetic and annotated real-world evaluation data, and the training and evaluation code for CARTO.
