Saliency detection, also known as salient object detection, aims to identify objects that attract human attention. Existing techniques in this field have primarily focused on improving the performance of models on benchmark testing datasets. However, these techniques often overlook the distribution gap issue within the saliency detection task. In this paper, we investigate the distributional uncertainty to gain a better understanding of trained saliency detection models. Our research aims to address this issue and provide insights into the uncertainties associated with saliency detection.
