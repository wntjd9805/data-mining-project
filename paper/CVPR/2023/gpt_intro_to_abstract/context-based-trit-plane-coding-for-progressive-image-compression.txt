Image compression is a fundamental problem in computer science and has been addressed through various traditional codecs such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and VVC. However, with the increasing usage of image data, there is a need for advanced codecs that provide better rate-distortion (RD) performance. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successfully adopted for image compression. These learning-based codecs transform images into latent variables and then encode those variables into a bitstream. Several innovations, including differentiable quantization, hyperprior, context models, and prior models, have been developed to improve RD performance, making deep image codecs competitive with traditional ones.Progressive image compression, which allows for the use of a single bitstream for multiple users with different bandwidths, is desired in many applications. However, relatively few deep codecs support progressive compression or scalable coding. Existing progressive codecs require training networks multiple times or generate multiple bitstreams for different bitrates, which is inefficient. This paper proposes the context-based trit-plane coding (CTC) algorithm for progressive image compression. The algorithm introduces novel context models, namely the context-based rate reduction (CRR) module and the context-based distortion reduction (CDR) module. CRR module entropy-encodes trit-planes more compactly by utilizing already decoded information, while CDR module refines partial latent tensors after entropy decoding for higher-quality image reconstruction. Additionally, a retraining scheme is proposed for the decoder to achieve better RD tradeoffs.Experimental results show that CTC outperforms existing progressive codecs significantly. Relative to the baseline trit-plane coding, CTC yields improved bitrate reduction and image quality enhancement. Furthermore, the proposed decoder retraining scheme greatly improves the RD performance. Compared to state-of-the-art progressive codecs, CTC achieves significant BD-rate reductions on various datasets.In summary, this paper introduces the CTC algorithm for progressive image compression, with novel context models, a retraining scheme for the decoder, and superior performance compared to existing progressive codecs.
