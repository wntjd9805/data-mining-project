Learning to make intricate driving decisions from images is a complex optimization task. However, current methods struggle to reliably learn internal representations that can be used for processing complex visual scenarios in a safe manner. To address this, we propose a novel method called CaT (Coaching a Teachable student) for training a sensorimotor agent to drive. Our approach incorporates explicit safety-aware cues and uses an alignment module to facilitate knowledge distillation from a privileged teacher to a vision-based student. We also introduce a coaching mechanism that manages difficult samples and improves model optimization. Through extensive teacher and auxiliary supervision, we are able to train a state-of-the-art image-based agent. Our work provides critical insights into the limitations of current approaches for learning robust and generalized representations for driving agents.
