In recent years, the analysis of 3D point cloud data has gained significant interest in the field of computer science. However, the sparse, unordered, and irregular nature of point clouds poses challenges for traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful information. Previous attempts to convert point clouds into grids have limitations in terms of computation and information loss. The introduction of permutation equivariance and invariance by PointNet and PointNet++ has allowed CNNs to process point clouds in their unstructured format. Several complex networks have been introduced, but they are computationally demanding and lack systematic comparison and analysis. Efforts have been made to compare these methods and identify crucial implementation details, but there is no unified framework to facilitate large-scale comparison. In this paper, we propose PointMeta, a meta architecture that abstracts the computation pipeline of point cloud analysis into four meta functions: neighbor update, neighbor aggregation, point update, and position embedding. PointMeta enables fair model comparison, re-evaluation of common design decisions, and application of best practices. Our experiments show that PointMetaBase achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower computation cost compared to previous methods.
