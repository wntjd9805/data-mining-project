Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify instances of ⟨human, object, interaction⟩ in an image, which can be beneficial for various computer vision tasks. Transformer networks have shown success in object detection, leading to the development of transformer-based HOI detection methods. Existing methods can be categorized into single-branch and two-branch approaches, but they face limitations in adapting to different sub-tasks simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose the MUtiplex RElation Network (MUREN) that leverages unary, pairwise, and ternary relation contexts for rich context exchange and relational reasoning. Our method consists of a multiplex relation embedding module and an attentive fusion module, and utilizes a three-branch architecture for human detection, object detection, and interaction classification. Experimental results on the HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that MUREN achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Therefore, our contributions include the introduction of the multiplex relation embedding module, the attentive fusion module, and the three-branch architecture, leading to improved HOI detection performance.
