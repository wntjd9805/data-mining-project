Deep machine learning algorithms have made significant progress in recognizing patterns and concepts. However, they still struggle with compositional generalization, which is a key aspect of human intelligence. In this paper, we focus on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), where models are trained to recognize unseen compositions composed of seen concepts. Specifically, we consider compositions composed of attributes (e.g., wet) and objects (e.g., apple). Our goal is to train models that can recognize images of new compositions by leveraging prior knowledge extracted from the conditions.Previous works in CZSL have mainly focused on modeling objects and the contextuality between attributes and objects. However, they often ignore the appearance diversity of attributes when composed with different objects, leading to a limited understanding of attribute diversity. In this paper, we propose a Conditional Attribute Network (CANet) that learns conditional attributes instead of concrete ones. We develop an attribute learning framework that consists of an attribute hyper learner and an attribute base learner.The attribute hyper learner learns from prior knowledge extracted from the conditions, while the attribute base learner encodes all attribute word embeddings into conditional attribute embeddings. These attribute embeddings change based on the recognized object and input image, allowing for better attribute matching in the attribute space.To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments and ablation studies to assess the effectiveness of CANet. The results demonstrate the importance of learning conditional attributes in the CZSL task. Overall, our contributions include proposing to learn attributes conditioned on the recognized object and input image, introducing an attribute learning framework, and providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of our approach.In conclusion, this paper addresses the challenge of compositional generalization in machine learning and proposes a novel approach, CANet, for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. By learning conditional attributes, our method enables models to recognize unseen compositions composed of seen concepts. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of CANet and emphasize the importance of learning conditional attributes in CZSL.
