In this paper, we introduce the concept of document layout analysis (DLA) and its importance in document understanding and digitization. We highlight the two main categories of DLA, physical layout analysis and logical layout analysis, which involve analyzing the visual presentation and semantic structure of documents, respectively. We discuss the dominance of deep learning methods in DLA and the limitations of current DLA datasets, such as small size, limited document formats, lack of document diversity, limited document languages, and few annotation categories.To address these limitations and promote fine-grained logical DLA in realistic scenarios, we present the Multi-Format, Multi-Type, Multi-Layout, Multi-Language, and Multi-Annotation Categories Modern document (M 6Doc) dataset. This dataset includes various document formats, types, layouts, languages, and annotation categories, offering great diversity and closely reflecting real-world scenarios. We provide several examples of the M 6Doc dataset to illustrate its richness.Furthermore, we propose a transformer-based model called TransDLANet for layout extraction. This model incorporates a transformer encoder for feature fusion, an adaptive element matching mechanism to focus on unique layout features, and a dynamic decoder for fusion of region of interest (RoI) features and image features. It also utilizes parameter-shared multi-layer perception (MLP) branches for multi-task learning.The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the M 6Doc dataset, which is the first dataset to include both real-world and born-digital files, as well as Chinese examples. It also provides fine-grained logical layout analysis categories, serving as a benchmark for related tasks. Additionally, we propose the TransDLANet model for document layout analysis, which features a transformer-like encoder, dynamic interaction decoder, and multi-layer perceptron branches.Overall, this paper aims to advance the field of document layout analysis by addressing the limitations of existing datasets and introducing a novel dataset and model for fine-grained logical DLA.
