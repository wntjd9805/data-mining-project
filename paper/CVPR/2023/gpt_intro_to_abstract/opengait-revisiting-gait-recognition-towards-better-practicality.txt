Gait recognition has gained increasing interest in recent years as a biometric authentication method. Unlike other biometrics such as face, fingerprint, and iris, gait patterns can be captured from a distance in uncontrolled settings without physical contact. Gait recognition has advantages in terms of robustness against subject-related covariates and is suitable for applications in public security, such as criminal investigation and suspect tracking. While significant progress has been made in gait recognition using deep learning techniques in laboratory settings, the performance of these methods degrades significantly when applied to real-world outdoor datasets. This performance gap is mainly attributed to factors like occlusion, background variation, and illumination changes. However, the efficacy of existing gait recognition methods varies across different datasets, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive benchmark study. This paper aims to propose an improved model for gait recognition while presenting a benchmark study to enhance practicality. The study focuses on developing models on both indoor and outdoor gait datasets, building a unified evaluation platform, and conducting ablative studies to revisit gait recognition conclusions. The paper introduces OpenGait, a flexible and efficient gait recognition codebase, which supports various datasets, state-of-the-art methods, and popular frameworks. The results of reproducing progressive methods and re-evaluating commonly accepted conclusions are presented. The paper also introduces a structurally simple and experimentally powerful baseline model, GaitBase, which outperforms recently proposed methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art in wild datasets. The contributions of this paper lie in the provision of OpenGait as a unified platform, re-evaluation of gait recognition developments, and the introduction of GaitBase as a baseline model for future algorithm design. The paper hopes to inspire researchers to develop more advanced gait recognition methods for real-world applications.
