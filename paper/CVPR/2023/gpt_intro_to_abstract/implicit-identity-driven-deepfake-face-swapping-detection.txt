Deep learning has advanced the technology of face forgery, particularly in the context of face swapping where a target face is replaced with a source face to generate a fake face. This technology enables attackers to create high-quality videos of public figures for illegal purposes. Existing methods for detecting face swapping typically treat it as a binary image classification task, but they lack an understanding of the forgery process and struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel implicit identity driven (IID) framework for face swapping detection. We introduce the concepts of explicit identity and implicit identity for fake faces, where explicit identity refers to the source face identity and implicit identity represents the potential target face identity contained in the fake face. We leverage a generic face recognition model to obtain explicit identity embeddings and propose the explicit identity contrast (EIC) loss and implicit identity exploration (IIE) loss to guide the deep network in distinguishing real and fake faces. The EIC loss aims to enforce real samples to be close to their explicit identities and push fake samples away from their explicit identities. The IIE loss, inspired by general face recognition algorithms, guides fake faces with known target identities to have small intra-class distances and large inter-class distances. Experimental results show that our IID framework outperforms existing methods in detecting face swapping.
