The introduction presents the problem of face forgery and the need for counter-detection methods to ensure social security. While some existing methods have shown effectiveness in identifying known forgery methods, generalization to unknown methods remains a challenge. Recent research has attempted to improve generalization by capturing intrinsic forgery clues through data modification and auxiliary task integration. However, the relations between face units that are essential for understanding facial characteristics have not been thoroughly explored. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing a face forgery detection framework that combines data modification, auxiliary task integration, and relation clues from facial action units. The framework includes the AU Relation Transformer (ART) and Tampered AU Prediction (TAP) components. ART learns relations between facial action units, while TAP formulates an auxiliary task to enhance the model's ability to detect local forgery defects. The proposed framework is evaluated using cross-dataset and cross-manipulation protocols, and results show its effectiveness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art detectors. The contributions of this work include the ART component for building correlations among AU-related regions and the TAP component for improving the model's capability to detect local forgery regions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the framework.
