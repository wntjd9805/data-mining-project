Abstract:3D shape classification is a critical task in computer vision and computer graphics. With the accessibility of 3D point cloud models due to advancements in 3D scanning technology, there has been increasing attention towards their classification in the past two decades. Mainstream neural networks have shown promising results in point cloud classification on manually processed and aligned data. However, these methods tend to perform poorly when dealing with complex real-world point clouds that are rotated, sparse, and noisy. Existing methods for complex point cloud classification rely on hand-crafted features, leading to limitations in capturing global information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning network model for robust classification of complex point clouds. Our model consists of two global feature learning sub-networks that utilize multi-scale Gram matrices constructed from point coordinates to capture global relationships and structures. The first sub-network extracts global relationships of point-point features through a network channel fusion operation, while the second sub-network enhances global relationships through an attention map generated from the global structure of a Gram matrix. Our proposed method outperforms existing methods in capturing global relationships and structures for complex point clouds. The end-to-end deep learning network model ensures invariance to rotational transformations and is capable of gathering information for sparse and noisy point clouds.
