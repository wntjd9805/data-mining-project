The paper introduces the concept of bit depth in digital contents and the need for bit depth expansion to recover missing bits caused by quantization. It discusses the limitations of conventional methods and highlights the success of learning-based approaches, particularly deep neural networks, in bit depth expansion. The paper also mentions the challenges associated with implicit neural representations and proposes a novel model called ABCD that addresses these challenges and improves the quality of de-quantization. The proposed model is capable of recovering missing bits from randomly quantized inputs and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The paper concludes by highlighting the main contributions of the study and the validation of the model on various datasets.
