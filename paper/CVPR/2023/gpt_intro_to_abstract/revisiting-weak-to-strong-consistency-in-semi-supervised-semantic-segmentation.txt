Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, particularly for applications like autonomous driving. However, the conventional fully-supervised approach requires a large number of meticulously labeled images, which can be expensive and impractical to obtain in certain domains. As a result, semi-supervised semantic segmentation has gained attention as a way to utilize a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to reduce annotation efforts. In this paper, we focus on the weak-to-strong consistency regularization framework, specifically the FixMatch approach, which has shown promising results in semi-supervised classification tasks. We observe that, when combined with appropriate strong perturbations, FixMatch can achieve superior performance in semi-supervised semantic segmentation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Motivated by this, we propose a unified perturbation framework that expands the perturbation space by incorporating image-level and feature-level perturbations. Additionally, we introduce a dual-stream perturbation strategy to fully leverage the pre-defined perturbation space and benefit from contrastive learning for more discriminative representations. Our proposed framework outperforms existing methods across different evaluation protocols and demonstrates superior performance in medical image analysis and remote sensing interpretation.
