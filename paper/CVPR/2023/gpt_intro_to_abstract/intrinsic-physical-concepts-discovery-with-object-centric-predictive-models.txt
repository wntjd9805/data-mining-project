Why do objects bounce off after collision? How do magnets attract or repel each other? These questions highlight the complex physical concepts that govern the interactions between objects. Humans have the ability to discover abstract concepts about the world through observation. Some concepts can be easily observed in the visual appearances of objects, while others are hidden in their behaviors. For example, concepts like mass and charge are unobservable from static scenes and can only be discovered through object dynamics. Machines need to learn to reveal and represent such common sense knowledge.This paper proposes two key steps to address this challenge: decomposing the world into object-centric representations and building a predictive model with abstract physical concepts as latent variables. Object-centric representation learning aims to perceive the world in a structured manner to improve the generalization ability of intelligent systems. Previous models have focused on learning disentangled features related to shape, color, and location, but have not successfully captured higher-level abstract concepts like mass and charge. This paper introduces PHYCINE, a hierarchical object-centric predictive model that infers physical concepts from low to high abstraction levels.The idea that abstract concepts can be learned through prediction has been explored in cognitive science, neuroscience, and AI. Physics concepts such as velocity, mass, and charge may emerge gradually through long-term predictions at the object representation level. By predicting at increasingly long time scales, more complex concepts about how the world works can be acquired. In this paper, the focus is on enabling the model to represent and disentangle these unfolded concepts.The proposed PHYCINE system consists of features arranged in a bottom-up pyramid that represent physical concepts at different abstraction levels. These features reconstruct and predict the observed world through cooperative efforts. Object context features reconstruct the observed image, object dynamics features predict the next-step object contexts, and mass and charge features model the interaction between objects. The model uses a relation module to calculate pair-wise forces and adaptively learn the variables representing object mass and charge. During training, all representations are iteratively refined using gradient information about the evidence lower bound obtained by the current estimate of the parameters.The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) successfully discovering intrinsic concepts of velocity, mass, and charge from raw videos, (ii) introducing PHYCINE, a hierarchical object-centric predictive model that infers physical concepts from low to high abstraction levels, and (iii) demonstrating the effectiveness of the learned representation on the ComPhy benchmark, a causal reasoning task.
