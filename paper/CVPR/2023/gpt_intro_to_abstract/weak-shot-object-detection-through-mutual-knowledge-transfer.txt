Recent advancements in supervised object detection models heavily rely on human-annotated bounding boxes and category labels, which are expensive and time-consuming to obtain. This has motivated research into alternative algorithms with lower annotation costs, such as Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) methods that only require image-level object category labels. However, there is still a significant performance gap between WSOD and fully supervised models. Research has shown that class-invariant visual evidence can be transferred from base categories to unseen ones, and utilizing an additional source dataset with fully annotated data can further improve WSOD performance. This learning paradigm, called Weak-shot Object Detection (WSHOD), combines a proposal generator trained on the source dataset and a multiple instance learning module trained on the target dataset. However, bridging the gap between the source and target datasets, particularly for non-overlapping categories, remains a challenge. Previous approaches have focused on post-processing predicted boxes or designing transferring scores. Some methods also use predicted boxes as pseudo labels to refine the training process. However, these practices may struggle to discriminate inaccurate pseudo labels or incorporate the multiple instance learning module into this process.To address these issues, we propose the Mutual Knowledge Transfer scheme for the WSHOD task. Our scheme includes a novel Knowledge Transfer (KT) loss that enforces consistency between the predicted objectness score and class entropy of the multiple instance learning module and the predictions of the proposal generator. This facilitates knowledge transfer from the source dataset to improve the training of the multiple instance learning module. We also introduce a Consistency Filtering (CF) method to enhance the quality of pseudo labels by injecting noise into feature maps. This method helps identify inaccurate pseudo labels by evaluating the stability of the multiple instance learning outputs.Through iterative application of the mutual knowledge transfer scheme, our method achieves significant improvements in detection performance on datasets with novel categories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to previous state-of-the-art WSHOD methods, without increasing model parameters or inference computational complexity.
