This paper introduces the URUR dataset, a novel large-scale dataset of ultra-high resolution (UHR) images with fine-grained dense annotations. Existing UHR segmentation methods rely on datasets with lower resolutions, resulting in limited performance and development in the field. The URUR dataset consists of 3,008 UHR images from 63 cities, with resolutions up to 26M pixels. It also includes 80 billion manually annotated pixels, with 2 million fine-grained instances across 8 categories. To address the challenge of balancing memory occupation and accuracy in UHR segmentation, the paper proposes WSDNet, an efficient and effective framework. WSDNet integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IWT) to preserve spatial details, allowing for higher inference speed without sacrificing accuracy. The paper presents the Wavelet Smooth Loss (WSL) to reconstruct structured context and texture distribution in the frequency domain. Experimental results demonstrate that WSDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, memory usage, and inference speed on multiple UHR datasets. Overall, this paper contributes the URUR dataset, WSDNet framework, and validates their superiority in UHR semantic segmentation.
