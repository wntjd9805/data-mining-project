In recent years, there has been significant progress in optical flow estimation using deep learning techniques. Many recent works focus on developing novel neural network architectures for this task. However, existing data augmentation schemes for optical flow training mainly focus on low-level variations and do not consider natural variations, scene context, and semantics. Additionally, obtaining ground truth optical flow on real data is challenging, and leveraging unlabeled data has been explored to address this problem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach called DistractFlow for optical flow estimation. DistractFlow performs semantically meaningful data augmentations by introducing distractors or perturbations to training frame pairs. These distractors are images of real objects and natural scenes that are overlaid on top of the original frame, providing challenging distractions for the optical flow estimation model. We demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of optical flow estimation models, especially in challenging real-world settings.We apply DistractFlow in both supervised and semi-supervised learning settings. In supervised learning, we use the ground-truth flow of the original frame pair and incorporate distracted pairs in the training process. In semi-supervised learning, we leverage unlabeled data by generating distracted versions of unlabeled frame pairs and enforcing the estimated flow on these distracted pairs to match the flow on the original pairs. We also introduce a confidence map to generate uncertainty-aware pseudo labels and enhance training stability and overall performance.Our main contributions are:1. Introducing DistractFlow, a novel data augmentation approach that improves optical flow estimation by utilizing distractions from natural images and providing augmentations with realistic semantic contents.2. Presenting a semi-supervised learning scheme that leverages DistractFlow to utilize unlabeled data and improve optical flow estimation performance.3. Demonstrating the effectiveness of DistractFlow in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, outperforming recent approaches that require additional in-domain unlabeled data.Overall, our approach shows promise in enhancing optical flow estimation models, making them more accurate and robust, particularly in challenging real-world scenarios.
