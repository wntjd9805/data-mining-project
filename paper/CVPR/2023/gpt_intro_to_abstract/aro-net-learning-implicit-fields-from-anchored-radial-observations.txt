In this paper, the authors propose a novel shape encoding called Anchored Radial Observations (ARO) for learning an implicit field representation of 3D shapes. The authors address the issue of transferability and generalizability in deep learning, specifically in the domain of 3D shape representation. They introduce a fixed set of anchors and develop a coordinate-based neural network to predict the occupancy at a query point based on locally observable shape information and directional and distance information from the perspective of the anchors. The authors compare their ARO-Net with other neural implicit models and demonstrate its superiority in terms of generalizability and fidelity to the input shape. They also conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods and perform ablation studies to evaluate different aspects of their approach. The results show that ARO-Net achieves high-quality surface reconstruction from sparse point clouds and exhibits superior performance compared to other methods.
