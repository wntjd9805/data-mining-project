With the increasing popularity of 3D scanners, capturing point clouds from real-world scenes has become convenient and affordable. However, these raw point clouds are often sparse, noisy, and incomplete, which affects the performance of various applications. To address this issue, point cloud upsampling is commonly performed in three steps: feature extraction, feature expansion, and coordinate prediction. However, this approach has limitations in terms of dependency on upsampling rate and inaccurate coordinate prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud upsampling algorithm that decouples the upsampling process into two steps. First, we upsample the point cloud in Euclidean space using midpoint interpolation, making the learning part independent of the upsampling module. Second, the upsampled point cloud is refined to minimize the difference with the ground truth high-resolution point cloud using point-to-point distance as the objective. We introduce P2PNet, a model trained to approximate the point-to-point distance function, and propose a training scheme to improve efficiency. Our method achieves accurate upsampling with arbitrary upsampling rates and outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and generalization to downstream tasks.
