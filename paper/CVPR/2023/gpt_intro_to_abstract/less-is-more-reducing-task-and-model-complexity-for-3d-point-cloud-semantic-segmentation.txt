3D semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds has become crucial for scene understanding in applications like autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods often require large backbone architectures and a significant amount of annotated data, making them impractical for deployment. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised methodology for 3D LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation called Less is More (LiM). Our approach incorporates a novel Sparse Depthwise Separable Convolution (SDSC) module that reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining high performance. We also introduce a Spatio-Temporal Redundant Frame Downsampling (ST-RFD) strategy to select a diverse subset of training frames, reducing temporal redundancy and annotation requirements. Additionally, we propose a soft pseudo-labeling method using the LiDAR reflectivity response to make effective use of limited annotated data. We evaluate our methodology on the SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI datasets and demonstrate improved performance compared to existing semi-supervised and weakly supervised methods. Our contributions include a novel methodology, a SDSC module, a ST-RFD strategy, and a soft pseudo-labeling method. Overall, our approach offers superior accuracy with fewer parameters and reduced computational costs.
