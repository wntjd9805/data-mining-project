Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a crucial task in computer vision that aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry of a scene using images captured from different viewpoints. MVS has applications in various fields such as automatic drive and virtual reality. Traditional MVS methods, based on Patch-Match (PM), are efficient in terms of memory consumption but struggle to handle textureless regions. Deep learning-based methods have larger receptive fields and perform better in these regions but consume more memory. In this paper, we propose a memory-friendly solution that combines the advantages of both approaches. We introduce adaptive patch deformation to increase the receptive field of unreliable pixels in traditional PM-based MVS, resulting in improved depth estimation. We use RANSAC to filter out unrelated reliable pixels and evaluate pixel reliability by analyzing matching cost profiles. Our proposed method, APD-MVS, achieves state-of-the-art results on ETH3D and Tanks and Temples datasets with lower memory consumption.
