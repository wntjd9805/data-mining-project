This paper addresses the problem of detecting and localizing methane (CH4) plumes from hyperspectral imaging data, which is crucial in combating global warming. Methane contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and has a high Global Warming Potential (GWP) compared to carbon dioxide. The paper highlights the importance of monitoring and curbing CH4 emissions, particularly from the oil and natural gas industries. Current methods rely on aerial imagery but suffer from false positives due to their dependence on spectral correlations. The authors propose MethaneMapper (MM), a deep-network based solution that combines spectral and spatial correlations to accurately localize methane plumes. MM utilizes a Spectral Feature Generator and a Query Refiner to generate potential CH4 plume candidates and remove confusers. Additionally, the paper introduces a new Methane Hot Spots (MHS) dataset, which is the largest publicly available dataset for methane detection, and outlines the contributions of the proposed approach, including the novel single-stage end-to-end approach, the improved Spectral Linear Filter (SLF), and the benchmark dataset.
