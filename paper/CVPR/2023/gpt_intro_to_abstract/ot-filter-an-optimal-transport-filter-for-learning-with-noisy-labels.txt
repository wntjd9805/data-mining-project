Deep learning has achieved significant success in various applications, but the accuracy of labels in real-world datasets remains a challenge. Obtaining high-quality labels from human workers is expensive and time-consuming, while collecting labels from internet queries leads to inaccurate labels. Existing methods for handling noisy labels, such as regularization and transition matrix, have limitations in handling real-world datasets. Sample selection has emerged as a promising direction for improving label quality, and existing approaches can be grouped into co-training networking and criterion-based filtering. However, these methods have drawbacks such as high training overhead and error accumulation. In this paper, we propose a novel filtering method called the OT-Filter, which leverages optimal transport to measure the discrepancy between probability measures and alleviate confirmation bias. The OT-Filter does not require prior knowledge of noisy rates, utilizes geometrically meaningful distances, and can be incorporated into existing robust training paradigms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the OT-Filter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the presence of high noise rates. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work, preliminary concepts, empirical studies, and future directions.
