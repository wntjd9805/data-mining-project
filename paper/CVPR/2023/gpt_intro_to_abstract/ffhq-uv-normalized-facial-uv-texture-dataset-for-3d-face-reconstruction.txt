The reconstruction of 3D shape and texture of a face from single or multiple images is a challenging task in computer vision and graphics. Previous research has focused primarily on improving shape estimation accuracy, with only a few works addressing texture UV-map recovery. Two important aspects in this problem are the fidelity and quality of the acquired texture maps. This paper aims to contribute a large-scale, publicly available facial UV-texture dataset consisting of high-quality texture maps. To achieve this, a fully automatic and robust pipeline is proposed, involving StyleGAN-based image editing to generate multi-view normalized faces and a UV-texture extraction, correction, and completion process. The resulting dataset, FFHQ-UV, contains over 50,000 evenly illuminated facial texture UV-maps that can be used for realistic digital human rendering. A GAN-based texture decoder trained on this dataset shows improved fidelity and quality in 3D face reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
