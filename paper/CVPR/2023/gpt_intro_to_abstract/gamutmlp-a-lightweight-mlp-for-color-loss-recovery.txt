The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the limitations of the standard RGB color space (sRGB) in representing the full range of visible colors. It highlights that sRGB is still widely used in saving color images despite modern display hardware being capable of wider gamuts. The paper also mentions that modern cameras encode images internally using the ProPhoto color space, which has a wider gamut capable of representing 90% of visible colors. The introduction introduces Figure 1, which illustrates the color clipping that occurs when converting a wide-gamut image to a small-gamut image. It explains that current image-processing software uses the ProPhoto space to manipulate images but ultimately saves them in sRGB, resulting in loss of color fidelity. The paper's contribution is then presented, which is to address the problem of recovering the original wide-gamut RGB representation from sRGB images. The authors propose optimizing a lightweight MLP model that can predict the original wide-gamut RGB values based on the gamut-reduced RGB values and their spatial coordinates. The optimized MLP model is embedded in the sRGB image as metadata and can be extracted to recover the wide-gamut color values. The paper describes the optimization process for the MLP model and demonstrates its effectiveness compared to other approaches. The authors have also created a dataset of wide-gamut/small-gamut image pairs for training and testing purposes.
