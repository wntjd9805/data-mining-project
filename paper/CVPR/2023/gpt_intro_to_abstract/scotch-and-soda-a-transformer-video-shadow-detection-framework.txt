Videos often contain shadows, which can negatively impact various video vision tasks. Therefore, the development of effective video shadow detection techniques is crucial. Detecting shadows in videos presents unique challenges compared to other segmentation tasks. It requires accounting for global content information such as light source orientation and object casting shadows. Shadows in videos also undergo appearance changes and can span over different backgrounds, making texture-based approaches unreliable. Video shadow detection methods can be categorized into image shadow detection (ISD) and video shadow detection (VSD). VSD methods, which incorporate spatial-temporal information, offer higher performance. State-of-the-art video shadow detection methods rely on deep neural networks and consist of three components: feature extraction, temporal aggregation, and decoding. Temporal aggregation mechanisms are critical for performance and temporal consistency loss plays a role as well. Existing temporal aggregation mechanisms designed for video tasks may not handle the deformations of shadows in videos effectively. Therefore, we propose ShadOw Deformation Attention trajectory (SODA), a spatial-temporal aggregation mechanism specifically designed to handle large shadow deformations. SODA operates in two steps: computing associated tokens for each spatial location and aggregating these tokens to yield new tokens with enriched spatial deformation information. We also introduce Shadow COnTrastive meCHanism (SCOTCH), a supervised contrastive loss that drives our network to learn more discriminative features for shadow regions. SCOTCH uses massive positive shadow pairs to enhance the learning of shadow representations invariant to variations such as shape and illumination. Our contributions include the introduction of SODA and SCOTCH in a new video shadow detection framework and the evaluation of our approach on the ViSha benchmark dataset. Experimental results show significant outperformance compared to existing methods, further supported by an ablation study.
