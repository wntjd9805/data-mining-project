In this paper, we propose the use of Therbligs, a low-level set of sub-actions, as a symbolic representation for action modeling. Therbligs were originally introduced in the early 20th century as elemental motions used to analyze complex movement. We adopt a subset of Therbligs that pertain to object manipulation. Our Therblig-centered framework offers various benefits, including compositionality and hierarchy, rule-based reasoning, resolution of semantic ambiguity, and contact-centered precision of temporal boundaries of action. Therbligs are consistent due to the demarcation of boundaries by contact transitions, and they capture meaningful information for action modeling. We demonstrate the composability of Therbligs into higher entities such as full actions and sequences constituting activities. By enforcing rules based on Therbligs, we achieve greater logical consistency and can introduce long-term constraints. Therbligs also exhibit semantic mutual exclusivity, reducing semantic ambiguity at the action-level. We introduce an architecture that utilizes Therbligs for video understanding and incorporates rule enforcement for contact-based logic. Our proposed hierarchical architecture consists of the Therblig-Model and the Action-Model, which map videos to Therbligs and actions, respectively. We validate our approach through evaluations on action segmentation, recognition, and anticipation tasks using the EPIC Kitchens 100 and 50-Salads datasets. Our contributions include Therbligs as a symbolic representation, flexible and differentiable rule-based constraints, and a novel hierarchical architecture. We also release Therblig-centered annotations for the evaluated datasets.
