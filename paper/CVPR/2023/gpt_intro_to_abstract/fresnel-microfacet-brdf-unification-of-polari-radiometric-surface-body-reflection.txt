This paper introduces a novel reflectance model, called the Fresnel Microfacet BRDF model (FMBRDF), which accurately represents both body and surface reflections in computer vision. The model is based on the physics of light reflection, specifically Fresnel reflection, and incorporates microgeometry with oriented mirror facets. By considering the full Fresnel behavior of light, the FMBRDF model encompasses both radiometric and polarimetric reflections, providing a comprehensive description of reflected light from rough surfaces. The paper validates the accuracy of the FMBRDF model using measured BRDFs and real surface images, demonstrating its ability to accurately model intensity and polarization. Furthermore, the FMBRDF model can be estimated from a single polarimetric image and can be used for joint estimation of reflectance and geometry from multiple images. This model is the first to unify body and surface reflections with the same microgeometry, while also incorporating radiometric and polarimetric behaviors. The authors believe that the FMBRDF model will serve as a valuable tool for accurate radiometric and polarimetric image analysis, enhancing various computer vision applications.
