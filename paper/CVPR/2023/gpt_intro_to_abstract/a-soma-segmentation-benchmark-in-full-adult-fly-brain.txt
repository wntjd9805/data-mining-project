This paper introduces a study on soma reconstruction in the full brain of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The soma, or cell body, plays a crucial role in maintaining neuron structure and controlling neural development and function. Traditional studies in this field have relied on low-resolution images obtained through optical microscopies, which limit the accuracy of soma morphology reconstruction. However, recent advancements in high-speed electron microscopy (EM) have allowed for the acquisition of high-resolution EM image datasets of various species, including Drosophila. This paper presents an efficient soma reconstruction method using a high-resolution EM dataset specifically annotated for soma distribution and morphology. The contributions of this work include the creation of a fine-grained 3D manual annotation dataset, the development of a two-stage deep learning algorithm for soma instance segmentation, the deployment of a parallelized data processing pipeline, and the presentation of quantitative and qualitative results showcasing the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. The potential implications of this research on understanding the drosophila neural system are discussed, and the benchmark dataset, code, and reconstruction result video are made available for future research.
