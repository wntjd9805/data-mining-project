Automatic report generation in the field of medicine has gained significant attention in recent years. This technology aims to generate informative and coherent reports to describe examination images, such as Chest X-Ray, Lung CT Scan, or funds angiography. These techniques have the potential to alleviate the workload of junior radiologists and reduce diagnosis errors. The use of deep learning methods, especially deep neural networks, has led to significant advancements in this field. However, the task of generating chest X-ray reports faces challenges due to visual and textual data bias. Medical images often have high similarity, while abnormal regions or lesions may lack detailed annotations. Additionally, sentences describing normal regions tend to appear repeatedly, making it difficult for models to describe specific abnormalities. Two approaches have been proposed to address these biases. The first approach involves integrating medical knowledge with computer systems, such as constructing graphs that represent relationships among findings and emphasize disease keywords. However, these graphs may be incomplete or inappropriate in certain cases. The second approach utilizes contrastive learning to improve visual and textual representations by contrasting positive and negative pairs. This not only helps capture abnormal regions but also distinguishes between normal and abnormal cases. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called DCL, which leverages a dynamic graph to enhance visual representations through contrastive learning. We combine general medical knowledge with specific knowledge extracted from similar reports, and propagate this information using a graph encoder. The refined node features are then used in a Transformer decoder to generate reports. We evaluate our framework on two benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of descriptive accuracy and clinical correctness. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging dynamic graphs and contrastive learning for high-quality report generation in radiology.
