Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within a cover medium to generate a stego output that can only be recovered by authorized receivers. In the digital world, images and videos are commonly used as covers for steganography. Traditional video steganography methods involve hiding messages in the spatial or transform domain through manual design. However, these methods have limitations in terms of hiding capacity and visibility, making them susceptible to detection. To address these limitations, recent studies have proposed deep learning methods for improving hiding capacity and performance, particularly in image and video steganography. This paper focuses on large-capacity and flexible video steganography, proposing a reversible pipeline for hiding and recovering multiple secret videos within a cover video. The proposed method achieves large hiding capacity, allows for different receivers to recover specific secret videos using specific keys, and can accommodate varying numbers of secret videos within a cover video through a scalable embedding module. Experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method in terms of hiding capacity and flexibility.
