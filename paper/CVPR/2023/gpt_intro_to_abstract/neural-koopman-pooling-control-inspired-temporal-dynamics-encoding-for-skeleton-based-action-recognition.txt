Skeleton-based human action recognition is an important task in various applications, such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and human-robot interaction. Deep learning methods, including LSTM, CNN, and GCN, have greatly improved the performance of action recognition. However, existing methods often use temporal average/max pooling, which only captures first-order information and neglects higher-order statistical information. To address this limitation, recent works have focused on second-order pooling techniques, such as bilinear and covariance pooling. Despite their effectiveness in capturing second-order information, they fail to discover the true dynamics of the sequence. To overcome this, we propose a new pooling method based on Koopman theory, which allows for the representation of the true latent dynamics of the sequence in linear Koopman space. Unlike existing methods, which implicitly model temporal correlation using covariance matrices, our proposed method explicitly models the temporal evolution of the feature vectors as a dynamical system. We learn a set of class-wise Koopman dynamics matrices to represent the dynamics of each class and achieve classification through dynamics matching. We also introduce an eigenvalue normalization technique to ensure stable and non-decaying learned dynamics. Experimental results on three skeleton-based action recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, significantly improving performance in both full-dataset and one-shot settings. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of Koopman pooling, the emphasis on stability in learning dynamics, and the demonstration of improved performance through comprehensive experiments.
