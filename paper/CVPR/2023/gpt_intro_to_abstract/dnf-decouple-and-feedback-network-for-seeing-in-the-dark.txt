In this paper, we address the challenge of low-light image enhancement (LLIE) in low-light scenarios. We propose a Decouple aNd Feedback (DNF) framework that utilizes the unique properties of RAW data and sRGB data to improve LLIE. Our framework decouples the enhancement process into two domain-specific subtasks: denoising in the RAW domain and color restoration in the sRGB domain. We also incorporate a feature-level dataflow, which reduces error accumulation and aggregates complementary features across stages. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR improvement, with fewer parameters and FLOPs.
