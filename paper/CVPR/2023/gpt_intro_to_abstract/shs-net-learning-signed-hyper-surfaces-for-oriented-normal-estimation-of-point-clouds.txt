This paper addresses the problem of estimating oriented normals for point clouds in computer vision and graphics. Oriented normals are essential for revealing geometric structures and are used in applications like rendering and surface reconstruction. Existing methods focus on either unoriented normal estimation or normal orientation, but few can reliably estimate oriented normals. This paper proposes a novel approach that learns signed hyper surfaces from point clouds to interpret the geometric property in a high-dimensional feature space. By considering both local and global shape properties, the method directly estimates normals with consistent orientation in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method and its state-of-the-art performance in both unoriented and oriented normal estimation.
