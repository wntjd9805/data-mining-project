This paper introduces a new training framework called DiGeo for generalized few-shot object detection. The success of object detection models heavily relies on the amount and quality of annotations, which can be costly and time-consuming. Traditional object detection models also struggle with classes that have limited annotations. To address these challenges, DiGeo aims to improve generalization on novel classes without sacrificing the detection of base classes. It achieves this by learning discriminative geometry-aware features through inter-class separation and intra-class compactness. The proposed framework is validated on Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving precise detection on base classes and efficient adaptation on novel classes using a single model. Additionally, DiGeo can be extended to long-tailed object detection. Experimental results on LVIS datasets further support the generalizability of the approach. The contributions of this paper include revisiting the limitations of existing methods in knowledge adaptation and knowledge forgetting, proposing DiGeo to pursue desired feature geometry, and conducting extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the framework.
