Accurate reconstruction of scene geometry and appearance plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks. Recent models like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved photorealistic renderings by representing the scene as a density and radiance field. However, these models often result in inaccuracies in the reconstructed scene geometry, particularly for objects with specularity or view-dependent effects. Another approach is to represent object surfaces using binary occupancy or Signed Distance Function (SDF), which can be optimized with volumetric rendering techniques. However, using a single fully-connected Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to parameterize the SDF leads to overly smooth geometry and color. In this paper, we propose a method called PermutoSDF that combines the strengths of hash-based encodings and implicit surfaces. We represent the scene as an SDF and a color field, and render it using unbiased volumetric integration. To handle ambiguous cases like specular or untextured surfaces, we propose a regularization scheme that ensures both smooth geometry where needed and reconstruction of fine details. Additionally, we improve upon the voxel hashing method by introducing permutohedral lattice hashing, which scales linearly with input dimensions for better 3D reconstruction and 4D background estimation.Our main contributions include a novel framework for optimizing neural implicit surfaces based on hash-encoding, an extension of hash encoding to a permutohedral lattice for faster optimization, and a regularization scheme that enables accurate SDF geometry reconstruction with fine details at the scale of pores and wrinkles.
