This paper introduces the problem of multi-object tracking (MOT) in computer vision, specifically in the context of automatic driving and surveillance. MOT aims to localize and track multiple objects with unique identities. Existing MOT methods follow a tracking-by-detection paradigm, dividing tracking into detection and association steps. However, appearance representation in these methods is limited by occlusions and noise. This paper proposes a fine-grained representation approach that focuses on local details of targets, improving performance even when targets are occluded. The paper also introduces Flow Alignment FPN (FAFPN), which aligns feature maps with different scales and enriches semantic information. Additionally, a Multi-head Part Mask Generator (MPMG) is proposed to generate part masks for detailed representations. The paper also presents a training strategy called Shuffle-Group Sampling (SGS) to disperse training data and balance positive and negative samples. The proposed methods are combined in a model called FineTrack. The contributions of this work include the introduction of FAFPN, MPMG, and SGS, which improve the accuracy and robustness of MOT.
