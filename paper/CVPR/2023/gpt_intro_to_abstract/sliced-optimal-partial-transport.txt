The Optimal Transport (OT) problem deals with finding the most cost-efficient way to transport one probability measure to another. It has gained significant attention in various fields such as data science, statistics, machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision. However, the core assumption of equal total mass in the source and target measures is not always applicable to practical problems that involve non-negative measures with varying total mass. Furthermore, OT distances are often not robust to outliers and noise. To address these issues, several variants of the OT problem have been proposed, including optimal partial transport (OPT) and unbalanced optimal transport. The computational complexity of linear programming for balanced and partial OT problems often poses a challenge when solving large-scale problems. Different approaches have been developed to tackle this issue, such as entropic regularization and exploiting specific properties of ground costs. The sliced OT approach, which assumes the ground cost is consistent with the Euclidean distance, has also been popular. This approach approximates the OT distance in higher-dimensional space using the OT distance in 1-dimensional Euclidean space.Motivated by these existing works, this paper proposes the sliced version of OPT and an efficient computational algorithm for empirical distributions with uniform weights. The contributions of this paper include a primal-dual algorithm for 1-dimensional OPT, the development of the Sliced-OPT (SOPT) distance in d-dimensional space, and the application of SOPT in point cloud registration and color adaptation problems. The proposed algorithm has a quadratic worst-case time complexity and linear or quadratic complexity in practice. The validity of the metric tree for SOPT remains a challenge, but the results show promising applications of the proposed approach.
