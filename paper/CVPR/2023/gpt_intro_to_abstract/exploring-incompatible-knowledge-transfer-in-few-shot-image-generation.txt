In recent years, deep generative models have shown great success in tasks such as image generation, editing, and data augmentation. However, most research in this area has focused on setups with large training datasets, limiting its applications in domains where data collection is difficult or expensive. To address this issue, FSIG has been proposed as a method to generate images with few reference samples from a target domain. Existing FSIG methods rely on transfer learning approaches to transfer knowledge from a source domain to learn the target generator. While these methods have been effective in preserving useful source knowledge, they fail to prevent the transfer of incompatible knowledge, which can result in unrealistic synthetic samples. In this work, we propose RICK, a lightweight filter-pruning based method to remove filters that encode incompatible knowledge during FSIG adaptation. Our proposed method effectively removes incompatible knowledge and improves the generative quality of the synthetic images.
