This paper discusses the importance of attention in understanding people's behavioral patterns and explores the use of attention in optimizing graphical designs, web page layouts, and user experience in immersive environments. It introduces a hierarchy of tasks for attention modeling, ranging from personalized attention to general saliency. The paper addresses two key challenges in saliency prediction models: the lack of variability in users' visual behaviors and the absence of a training paradigm for understanding attention composition. To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes a user-aware saliency modeling approach that incorporates visual preferences, personalized filters, and adaptive user masks. The paper also introduces a progressive learning method to learn the composition of attention from different users. The contributions of the paper include the development of a novel model for predicting attention of various users, the presentation of a progressive learning method for capturing attention variability, and extensive experiments and analyses to demonstrate the advantages of user-aware saliency modeling.
