Modern medical datasets often contain both imaging and tabular data. This multimodal data is utilized by clinicians for diagnosis and treatment, as well as in the creation of biobanks for disease research. Biobanks pool vast amounts of data from large populations, providing valuable information for machine learning models. However, implementing these models in clinical practice is challenging due to limitations in clinical workflow and the lack of sufficient data. Therefore, there is a need for unsupervised strategies that can learn from biobank data and be applied in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a contrastive framework that combines imaging and tabular data. Our framework is based on leading contrastive learning solutions and is effective for predicting cardiac health from MR images. We also introduce a novel form of supervised contrastive learning that outperforms other strategies by incorporating the label as a tabular feature. Experimentally, we find that morphometric features play a significant role in contrastive learning and demonstrate their importance using attribution methods and ablation experiments. Overall, our framework and methods have the potential to improve the use of multimodal data in healthcare applications.
