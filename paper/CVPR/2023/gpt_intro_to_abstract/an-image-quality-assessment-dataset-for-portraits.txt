The paper introduces the problem of assessing the quality of portrait images captured on smartphones. It highlights the importance of portrait photography in social media and various applications, as well as the complex exercise of capturing high-quality portraits. The paper discusses the challenges faced by smartphone manufacturers in delivering optimal visual quality while minimizing production costs. The use of non-linear processing techniques in smartphone cameras makes traditional objective quality assessment unreliable. Therefore, automatic image quality assessment (IQA) methods, particularly blind IQA (BIQA), have been developed to mimic human perception of quality. However, the subjective nature of image quality assessment makes it difficult to use BIQA methods as accurate measures. Thus, there is a need to develop a formal framework to objectively evaluate and compare subjective judgments. The paper presents a new dataset, PIQ23, consisting of portrait images captured using various smartphone devices, along with an IQA experiment conducted with image quality experts. The paper also introduces a statistical analysis method and compares multiple BIQA models to strengthen image quality prediction. Overall, the paper aims to contribute to the field of smartphone portrait photography and improve IQA methods.
