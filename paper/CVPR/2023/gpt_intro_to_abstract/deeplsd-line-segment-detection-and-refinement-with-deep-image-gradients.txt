Line segments play a crucial role in various computer vision tasks such as 3D reconstruction, localization, vanishing point estimation, and tracking. Traditional methods for extracting line segments rely on handcrafted algorithms, which can suffer from noise and lack of robustness in challenging conditions. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by leveraging the image context and handling complex line structures. However, current deep detectors are limited by the lack of sufficient training data and still lag behind handcrafted methods in accuracy on easy images. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of deep learning and handcrafted methods. We introduce a dual representation of line segments using attraction fields, which are well-suited for deep learning. We also develop an optimization procedure that refines the detected line segments based on the attraction field and vanishing points. Our contributions include a method to bootstrap current detectors and create ground truth line attraction fields, an optimization technique for refining line segments and vanishing points, and a pipeline that achieves state-of-the-art performance by combining deep learning robustness with handcrafted method accuracy.
