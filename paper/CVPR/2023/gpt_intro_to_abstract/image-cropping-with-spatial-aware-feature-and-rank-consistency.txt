The task of image cropping plays a crucial role in improving image quality and meeting aesthetic requirements in photography-related applications. Previous studies have focused on automatic image cropping, using saliency detection or hand-crafted features. However, these methods have limitations in considering the spatial relationship between crops and aesthetic elements. This paper proposes a learnable spatial-aware feature that encodes this relationship by using channel-wise max pooling and weighted feature maps. Additionally, the paper explores the use of ranking knowledge from labeled images to unlabeled images to improve cropping performance. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to image cropping that achieves state-of-the-art performance.
