The continuous growth of data volumes in AI technologies has increased the need for more powerful hardware solutions. Quantum computing has emerged as a promising direction to address this challenge by leveraging quantum mechanical effects for computations and optimization. Among the two quantum computing models, Adiabatic Quantum Computers (AQCs) have gained attention in the computer vision community due to advancements in experimental hardware realizations. AQCs provide sufficient resources to tackle combinatorial problems in computer vision that are difficult to solve on classical hardware. However, mapping computer vision problems to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form, which AQCs operate on, is a research question in the field. This paper introduces QUMF, the first quantum multi-model fitting (MMF) approach, that leverages AQCs to explain data with multiple and disjoint geometric models. QUMF demonstrates competitive results on real datasets and can also be applied to single-model fitting. The paper also proposes DEQUMF, a decomposition policy to scale QUMF to large-scale problems. The experimental evaluation, related work, and limitations are discussed, concluding with the contributions of this paper.
