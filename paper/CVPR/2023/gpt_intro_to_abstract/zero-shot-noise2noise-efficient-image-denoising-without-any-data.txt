Image denoising is a critical process in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging where fine details are vital for accurate diagnosis. Current state-of-the-art denoising techniques rely on large datasets of clean-noisy image pairs, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Additionally, these methods may suffer from a performance drop when tested on images from a different distribution. To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a dataset-free method that leverages recent advancements in image denoising. The proposed method does not require an explicit noise model and is suitable for various noise types, making it applicable even when the noise distribution or level is unknown. The approach involves convolving the noisy test image with two fixed filters and training a lightweight network to map one downsampled image to the other. Despite using a small network and not relying on training data, the proposed method achieves good denoising quality and often outperforms larger networks trained on datasets. Two key attributes of the proposed method are highlighted: reduced computational cost compared to existing dataset-free neural network-based algorithms and better generalization to different noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard baselines.
