In this paper, the authors propose a bilevel-memory framework for incremental learning, inspired by the multi-level human memory system. They introduce a Bilevel Memory model with Knowledge Projection (BMKP) that consists of a working memory and a long-term memory. The working memory is responsible for adaptively learning new knowledge, while the long-term memory stores all the learned knowledge. The authors address the issue of extracting and assimilating knowledge from the working memory into the long-term memory by proposing a knowledge projection process. They define a Parameter Knowledge Space (PKS) and a Core Knowledge Space (CKS), and utilize pattern basis in the CKS to represent the parameters. The authors also design a representation compaction regularizer to encourage the working memory to reuse previously learned knowledge, improving both memory efficiency and performance. The authors evaluate their proposed model on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets and demonstrate that BMKP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with lower memory usage.
