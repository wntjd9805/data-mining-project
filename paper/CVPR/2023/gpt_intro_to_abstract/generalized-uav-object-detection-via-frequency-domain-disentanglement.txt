Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) equipped with cameras have become increasingly popular in various applications. Among these, UAV object detection (UAV-OD) has received significant attention. However, the unpredictable operating environment and domain shift pose challenges for UAV-OD networks that have been trained on a specific dataset and need to perform well on real-world data. Existing methods for alleviating the domain shift, such as domain adaptation (DA) and domain generalization (DG), have limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improving the generalization ability of UAV-OD networks through frequency domain disentanglement. We conduct preliminary experiments to identify the spectrum bands that contribute the most to generalization. Based on these findings, we use two learnable filters to extract the domain-specific and domain-invariant spectrums and design an instance-level contrastive loss to guide the disentangling process. Our experiments on three unseen target domains demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the potential of frequency domain disentanglement for improving UAV-OD generalization.
