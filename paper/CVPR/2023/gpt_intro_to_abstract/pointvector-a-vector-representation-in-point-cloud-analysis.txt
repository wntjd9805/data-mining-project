Point cloud analysis has become a popular topic in computer science, particularly with the introduction of PointNet and PointNet++. Many point-based networks have introduced novel modules for extracting local features, such as attention-based methods, convolution-based methods, and graph-based methods. However, these methods can be complicated to design in terms of network structure. PointNeXt adapts the Set Abstraction module of PointNet++ and proposes the Inverted Residual MLP module, which achieves good results with a simple MLP network design. Building on this work, we aim to further explore the potential of the MLP structure. We introduce a vector representation of features to extend the range of feature variation and regulate the connections between local features. Unlike template-based methods, we generate vector representations for neighboring points and aggregate them. This approach introduces less bias and improves generalization capabilities. We also enhance the generation of 3D vector representations by using a vector rotation matrix with independent angles. Inspired by PointNeXt and PointNet++, we present the Vector Point Set Abstraction (VPSA) module, which obtains vector representations from input features and aggregates them using a reduction function. By combining VPSA and SA modules, we construct a PointVector model similar to PointNeXt. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, particularly in semantic segmentation tasks. We propose a novel immediate vector representation and explore the method of obtaining vector representation using a vector rotation matrix. Our PointVector model achieves high performance with fewer parameters compared to PointNeXt.
