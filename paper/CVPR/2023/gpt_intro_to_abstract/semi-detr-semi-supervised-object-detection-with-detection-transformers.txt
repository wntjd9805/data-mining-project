Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) aims to enhance the performance of fully-supervised object detectors by leveraging unlabeled data. While traditional object detectors rely on hand-crafted components, recent advancements in transformer-based detectors, such as DETR, have shown promising results in fully-supervised object detection. However, there is limited exploration on designing a feasible SSOD framework for DETR-based detectors.This paper proposes a novel SSOD framework called Semi-DETR based on the Teacher-Student architecture. The framework includes a Stage-wise Hybrid Matching module that combines one-to-many and one-to-one assignment strategies to improve training efficiency and generate high-quality pseudo labels. Additionally, a Cross-view Query Consistency module constructs cross-view object queries to learn semantically invariant characteristics. Furthermore, a Cost-based Pseudo Label Mining module dynamically mines reliable pseudo boxes for consistency learning.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Semi-DETR outperforms previous state-of-the-art SSOD methods, such as PseCo and Dense-Teacher.In conclusion, this paper contributes by proposing a DETR-based SSOD method, identifying core issues in integrating DETR-based detectors with the SSOD framework, and introducing novel modules to address training inefficiency and learn semantic feature invariance. The proposed Semi-DETR achieves significant improvements in SSOD performance.
