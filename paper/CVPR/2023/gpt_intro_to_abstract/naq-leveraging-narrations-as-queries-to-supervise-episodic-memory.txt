Human memory can be unreliable and can lead to everyday challenges such as misplacing objects or forgetting tasks. The concept of first-person or "ego-centric" perception on a wearable camera aims to alleviate this cognitive overload by providing a superhuman personal episodic memory. This memory would allow individuals to see and index their visual experiences in a meaningful and easily accessible way. The Natural Language Query (NLQ) task focuses on searching long egocentric videos to identify specific temporal windows that can answer free-form questions about past visual experiences. This functionality could greatly enhance the augmented reality experience for users wearing always-on AR glasses or assist a mobile household robot in answering queries about its visual history. The NLQ challenge has gained significant attention in the research community, with recent efforts in video-language question answering. However, the technical challenges in this domain are significant, including free-form queries, tiny temporal windows, and the noisy nature of wearable camera videos. The most successful methods in NLQ leverage visual-language embeddings and large-scale pretraining on video-text pairs from the Ego4D dataset's provided narrations. These methods have shown notable improvements in accuracy across various query types and metrics. Notably, these gains are achieved even compared to existing methods that utilize similar or more narration annotations, indicating the success of these models lies in effective modeling rather than more data. Furthermore, these methods can even benefit from video-language grounding on exocentric videos, highlighting the advantage of augmenting training with narrated egocentric videos. The proposed NaQ (Natural Language Query) model achieves state-of-the-art results on the NLQ challenge, surpassing previous challenge winners. Additionally, a thorough analysis of NaQ's strengths, weaknesses, and useful properties, such as its effectiveness on long-tail object queries and zero-shot and few-shot NLQ, is provided.
