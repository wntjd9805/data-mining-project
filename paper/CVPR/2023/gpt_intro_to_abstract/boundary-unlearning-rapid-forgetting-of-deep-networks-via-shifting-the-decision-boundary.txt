This paper addresses the issue of data privacy and the need for efficient machine un-learning techniques in the context of deep neural networks (DNNs). Specifically, the authors focus on unlearning an entire class from DNNs, which is relevant in scenarios such as face recognition. The authors propose a novel approach called Boundary Unlearning, which aims to shift the decision boundary of the forgetting class without significant computational resources or intervention in the original training pipeline. They present two methods, Boundary Shrink and Boundary Expanding, for achieving this goal. Extensive experiments are conducted on image classification and face recognition tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Boundary Unlearning, and the results show that it outperforms four state-of-the-art techniques. The code for reproducibility has been released. Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of machine un-learning and provides a practical solution for forgetting data from DNN models.
