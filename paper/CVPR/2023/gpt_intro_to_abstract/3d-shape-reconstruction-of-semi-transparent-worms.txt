This paper introduces a study on marker-less 3D shape reconstruction of the C. elegans, a small animal with a tapered cylinder shape. The authors obtained a large dataset of experimental recordings of individual worms moving in a gelatin solution using multiple cameras. They aim to reconstruct the 3D shape of the worms and find corrected camera parameters through a process similar to bundle adjustment. However, imaging the worms presents difficulties due to their small size and self-occlusion. To address these challenges, the authors propose an integrated algorithm that projects curve vertices through camera models, renders images for comparison, and scores the intersection with worm-like pixels in all views. They also introduce a novel viewpoint renderer to capture optical distortions and transparency. The proposed pipeline offers a robust method for 3D posture reconstruction of freely deforming semi-transparent objects.
