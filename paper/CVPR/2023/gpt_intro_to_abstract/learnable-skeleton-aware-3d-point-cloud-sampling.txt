With the advancement of 3D sensing technologies, acquiring and accessing 3D data has become more accessible. This has led to the availability of numerous online data repositories containing 3D models. Among different 3D shape representations, point clouds have gained popularity due to their ability to capture detailed geometry and topology information. However, point cloud sampling, which aims to find a smaller subset of points that effectively represent the shape and topology of an object, is still a challenging task. Traditional methods such as random sampling and farthest point sampling have limitations in terms of efficiency and preserving object geometry. To address this, we propose a skeleton-aware point cloud sampling approach that leverages object skeletons to preserve the underlying shape structures. We illustrate the comparison between random sampling and skeleton-aware sampling. Skeleton extraction is a non-trivial task due to the diversity of object topological structures and the time-consuming and sensitive nature of topological methods. We utilize the medial axis transform (MAT) definition of object skeletons and deep neural networks for unsupervised learning of effective skeletal representations. Using the learned object skeletons, we formulate a probabilistic point cloud sampling pipeline. This involves calculating the local feature size (LFS) for each point and using the LFS distribution as the prior sampling probability. We optimize the sampling probability for downstream tasks using joint optimization. Our proposed method preserves object geometry and topology during sampling and introduces category-agnostic skeleton learning. We evaluate the approach through experiments on three important downstream tasks: point cloud classification, retrieval, and reconstruction. The results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in preserving object information and improving performance on downstream tasks.
