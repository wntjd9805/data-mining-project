This paper addresses the challenge of varying appearances of the same landmark in different photos, caused by dynamic lighting changes. The authors propose a method for outdoor scene relighting using a combination of neural radiance fields (NeRF) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike existing methods, their approach takes into account important intrinsics such as cast shadows and the distinction between non-sky and sky regions. They propose a modified NeRF system to estimate diffuse albedo, surface normal, cast shadow, and illumination parameters, and design separate CNN modules to predict the intrinsic and lighting parameters for high-quality relighting. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in achieving visually pleasing relighting results.
