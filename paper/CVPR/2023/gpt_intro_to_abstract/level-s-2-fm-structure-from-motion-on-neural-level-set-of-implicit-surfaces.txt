This paper introduces a novel approach called Level-S2fM for Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a 3D vision problem in computer science. SfM aims to reconstruct 3D scenes and estimate camera motions from a set of uncalibrated images. Previous studies have largely focused on keypoint correspondences and theoretical findings of Multi-View Geometry. The authors propose integrating top-down information into the SfM system by using neural implicit surfaces, which can parametrize all 3D scene points as the zero-level set of a signed distance function. The authors address the problem of optimizing neural SDF from uncalibrated images by leveraging 2D matches and tracing 3D points in a holistic manner. They present experimental results on various datasets, demonstrating the superiority of their Level-S2fM approach compared to existing methods. The contributions of the paper are the introduction of Level-S2fM as the first implicit neural SfM solution and the exploration of inductive biases in 2D correspondences for neural implicit fields learning.
