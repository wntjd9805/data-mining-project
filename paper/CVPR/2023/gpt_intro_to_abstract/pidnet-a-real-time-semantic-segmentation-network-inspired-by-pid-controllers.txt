The Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller is a widely applied concept in dynamic systems and processes. Despite the development of advanced control strategies, the PID controller remains popular due to its simplicity and robustness. This concept has also been extended to other areas, such as image denoising and optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for real-time semantic segmentation tasks using the PID controller concept. Our model surpasses previous works and achieves the best trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Semantic segmentation is important for applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging diagnosis. While deep convolutional networks have dominated this field, their computational costs hinder their real-time application. Previous efficient models have reduced latency and memory usage but sacrifice accuracy. We propose PIDNet, a three-branch network architecture, to address these limitations. We provide extensive experiments and demonstrate PIDNet's superiority on various datasets. The main contributions of this paper are the connection between deep CNN and PID controller, the proposal of efficient modules, and the achievement of the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. PIDNet-S achieves 78.6% mIOU with a speed of 93.2 FPS, while PIDNet-L achieves the highest accuracy (80.6% mIOU) in real-time scenarios without acceleration tools.
