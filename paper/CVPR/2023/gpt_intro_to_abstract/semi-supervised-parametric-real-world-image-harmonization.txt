Image harmonization is a technique used to enhance visual consistency when combining foreground subjects with background images captured under different conditions. However, current learning-based image harmonization methods face limitations due to a significant domain gap between the synthetic data they are trained on and real-world composites. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-stream semi-supervised training strategy that allows training with real composites, which exhibit richer local appearance mismatches. Additionally, we introduce a parametric harmonization method that captures complex local effects using shading maps, resulting in more diverse and photorealistic harmonization results. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of quantitative results and visual comparisons on both synthetic and real composite test sets. Furthermore, our parametric model runs at an interactive rate, even on high-resolution images, offering intuitive controls for artists to customize the harmonization result post-hoc.
