Human pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications in action recognition, person re-identification, and human-object interaction. Recent methods for human pose estimation can be categorized into top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down methods use a human detector to detect individuals in an image and perform single-person pose estimation, while bottom-up methods locate the body joints of all people in the image simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on bottom-up methods and propose a novel approach to optimize the body joints over sub-regions of the predicted heatmap. We argue that using the overall L2 loss to supervise the predicted heatmap may not be the optimal choice, as it does not always lead to accurate localization of body joints across different sub-regions. To address this, we express the predicted and groundtruth heatmaps as characteristic functions and minimize the distance between these functions, allowing for simultaneous optimization of body joints in different sub-regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on evaluation benchmarks.
