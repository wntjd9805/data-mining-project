Trajectory prediction plays a vital role in various fields such as autonomous driving, drones, surveillance systems, human-robot interaction, and interactive robotics. Many research advances have been made in trajectory prediction, including temporal encoding, interaction modeling, and rasterized prediction. Stochastic trajectory prediction, which aims to model the distribution of future trajectories, has gained attention. Several deep generative models have been proposed, including generator adversarial networks, conditional variational auto-encoders, and conditional normalizing flow. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have also been applied to trajectory prediction with promising results. However, there are two critical problems in diffusion models: slow real-time inference and limited diversity in predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction model called the leapfrog diffusion model (LED) to address these issues. LED accelerates inference speed and enables adaptive and diverse predictions by using a leapfrog initializer instead of a plain Gaussian distribution. We introduce a reparameterization for the leapfrog initializer and design trainable modules to estimate mean trajectory, variance, and sample positions. We evaluate our method on four trajectory prediction datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance, reducing average prediction time by around 20 times compared to the standard diffusion model. Our contributions include the proposal of LED, a denoising-diffusion-based trajectory prediction model, the introduction of a trainable leapfrog initializer, and extensive experiments demonstrating the superiority of our approach.
