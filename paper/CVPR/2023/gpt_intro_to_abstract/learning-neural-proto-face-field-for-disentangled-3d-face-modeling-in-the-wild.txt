3D face reconstruction is a complex problem with numerous applications in computer graphics, gaming, and mobile photography. Traditional methods for 3D face reconstruction rely on strong assumptions and parametric models. More recently, deep learning techniques have been used to regress 3D face models from input images. However, these methods have limitations in terms of modeling fine details and producing photo-realistic texture. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Proto-face Field (NPF) approach for unsupervised 3D face modeling. NPF leverages uncertainty modeling and multi-image priors to disentangle identity, expression, and scene-specific details from in-the-wild photo collections. The method combines a face prototype aggregation method, expression consistency loss, and geometry and appearance regularization to achieve robust and high-quality 3D face reconstruction. Our contributions include the introduction of NPF, the integration of multi-image face priors, and the development of novel consistency losses. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing accurate and realistic 3D faces compared to existing methods.
