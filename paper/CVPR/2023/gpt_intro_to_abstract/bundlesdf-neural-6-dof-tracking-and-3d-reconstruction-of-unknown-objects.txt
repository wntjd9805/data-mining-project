This paper addresses the problems of 6-DoF pose tracking and 3D reconstruction of unknown objects in computer vision. Previous approaches to these problems have often been separate and limited in their assumptions. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a method that solves both problems jointly, allowing for greater flexibility and accuracy. The method assumes a rigid object and requires a 2D object mask in the first frame of the video. The approach involves online pose graph optimization, a neural object field for reconstruction, and a memory pool for communication between processes. The robustness of the method is demonstrated through experiments on public benchmarks, showcasing its state-of-the-art performance. The contributions of this paper include a novel method for pose tracking and reconstruction, a hybrid SDF representation for handling uncertain free space, and improved performance compared to leading methods.
