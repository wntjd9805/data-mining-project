This paper introduces Dionysus, a novel high-quality real-time 3D reconstruction framework for recovering 3D structures from 2D images. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods struggle to balance model quality and real-time response. Current approaches use coarse-to-fine models that sample a set of candidate depths or voxels and evaluate their reliability using neural networks. However, these methods often miss delicate objects and suffer from crude details. To address these issues, Dionysus proposes selecting depth candidates based on semantic estimations, ensuring consistent and efficient reconstruction. The framework distinguishes each depth candidate's reliability by assessing its semantic consistency among warped views. By leveraging semantic segmentation models, Dionysus achieves dense, adaptive, and high-quality reconstruction. Additionally, the paper introduces a depth reassignment technique to handle irregular inputs and efficiently allocate depth samples. Experimental results on popular 3D reconstruction datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.
