This paper introduces the Simple Multimodal Algorithmic Reasoning Task (SMART) and the associated SMART-101 dataset, aiming to improve the visuo-linguistic algorithmic reasoning abilities of deep neural networks. The dataset consists of 101 distinct children's puzzles that require a range of elementary mathematical skills and foundational skills in interpreting abstract images, counting, spatial reasoning, pattern matching, and occlusion reasoning. The paper proposes an end-to-end meta-learning based neural network architecture for solving the puzzles, using a pre-trained image encoder backbone and a large language model. The performance of the neural networks is evaluated under various settings, including in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization. The results indicate the need for further research into algorithmic reasoning to solve the SMART-101 puzzles. The paper also presents key contributions, including the dataset, a programmatic augmentation strategy, the neural architecture, and insights into the performance of state-of-the-art neural networks on the task.
