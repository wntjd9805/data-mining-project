Traditional object detection models operate under the assumption that all detected classes must be labeled and given during training. However, in real-world scenarios, object detection systems often encounter unknown objects that were not present in the training data. To address this problem, Open World Object Detection (OWOD) has been proposed, where the detection models should be able to identify both known and unknown categories and incrementally learn the unknown classes. Previous OWOD approaches manually selected specific regions as unknown proposals, introducing uncertainties and potentially degrading the detection performance of known categories. In this paper, we propose a novel Annealing-based Label-Transfer framework for OWOD. Our approach leverages all the known proposals to distill unknown features of meaningful semantic patterns, promoting collaborative learning of known and unknown classes. We introduce Label-Transfer Learning to disentangle meaningful unknown traits from known proposals and a Sawtooth Annealing Scheduling strategy to adjust the disentanglement degree and encourage the collaborative learning of both classes. We also propose a new evaluation metric, Equilibrium Index, to comprehensively measure known and unknown detection performance. Experimental results on a commonly-used dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving substantial gains in unknown mAP performance compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a better known detection performance.
