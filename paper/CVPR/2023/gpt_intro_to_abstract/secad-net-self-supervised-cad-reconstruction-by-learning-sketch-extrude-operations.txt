CAD reconstruction is a widely used technology in reverse engineering when the original design document or CAD model is unavailable. The advancement in 3D scanning has enabled the shift towards automatic CAD reconstruction. Previous methods involve reconstructing a polygon mesh from scanned point clouds and converting it into a boundary representation (B-rep) using mesh segmentation and primitive extraction. However, these methods have limitations in representing complex 3D shapes. Some recent methods have utilized neural networks to improve this pipeline by detecting and fitting primitives directly from raw point clouds or by parsing point cloud inputs into a constructive solid geometry (CSG) tree. However, these methods have limited representation and editability capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network framework called SECAD-Net for reconstructing high-quality and editable CAD models. Our approach focuses on learning the sketch and extrude modeling operations rather than using parametric primitives. SECAD-Net learns the position and axis of each sketch plane by decomposing the shape into multiple local regions and uses a fully connected network to learn the implicit representation of the sketch. An extrusion operator calculates the implicit expression of cylinders based on the predicted sketch and extrusion parameters. Finally, a union operation assembles all extrusion cylinders into the final CAD model. Our approach allows for flexibility and efficiency in constructing a wide range of 3D shapes. The predictions of our method are fully interpretable, allowing users to express their ideas and make variations or improvements to the design using 2D sketches or 3D cylinders intuitively. The contributions of our work include:- The presentation of SECAD-Net, a novel deep neural network for reverse engineering CAD models with self-supervision, resulting in faithful reconstructions.- The capability of SECAD-Net to learn implicit sketches and differentiable extrusions from raw 3D shapes without the need for ground truth sketch labels.- Extensive experiments that demonstrate the superiority of SECAD-Net through comprehensive comparisons. We also showcase its applications in CAD interpolation, editing, and single-view reconstruction.
