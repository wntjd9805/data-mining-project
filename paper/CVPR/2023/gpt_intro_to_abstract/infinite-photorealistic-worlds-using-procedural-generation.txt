This paper introduces Infinigen, a procedural generator of photorealistic 3D scenes of the natural world. Unlike existing sources of synthetic data, Infinigen offers a combination of properties that make it unique and valuable for computer vision tasks. It generates infinitely many distinct shapes, textures, materials, and scene compositions, providing a diverse coverage of objects and scenes in the natural world. Infinigen creates highly photorealistic 3D scenes by procedurally generating both coarse structures and fine details in geometry and texture. All geometric details in Infinigen are real, ensuring accurate geometric ground truth for 3D reconstruction tasks. Infinigen is a free and open-source tool that builds on the Blender graphics system. It can be customized to generate a large variety of task-specific ground truth and serves as a generator of 3D assets for various applications. The paper describes the construction of Infinigen and presents experimental results validating the quality of the generated synthetic data. The authors also provide an analysis of computational costs and future plans to expand and collaborate with the community to cover a wide range of visual objects and scenes.
