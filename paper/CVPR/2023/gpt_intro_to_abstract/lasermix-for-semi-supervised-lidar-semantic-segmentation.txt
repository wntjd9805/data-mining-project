LiDAR segmentation is a crucial task in autonomous driving, but annotating LiDAR point clouds is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution that leverages unlabeled data for scalable LiDAR segmentation. However, SSL frameworks designed for image and semantic segmentation tasks do not perform well on LiDAR data due to the modality gap between 2D and 3D. This paper explores the use of spatial prior for semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation and proposes LaserMix, a framework that mixes laser beams from different LiDAR scans to leverage the spatial cues in LiDAR data. The proposed framework achieves competitive results with fewer labels compared to fully supervised methods and outperforms existing semi-supervised segmentation methods on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets. LaserMix is representation-agnostic and compatible with state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation methods. The effectiveness of spatial prior in the framework is demonstrated through comprehensive empirical analysis. The key contributions of this work include a statistically grounded SSL framework, the novel LaserMix mixing technique, and improved performance in both low- and high-data regimes. This work lays a solid foundation for semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation.
