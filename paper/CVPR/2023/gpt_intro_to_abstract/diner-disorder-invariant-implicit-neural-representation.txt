This paper introduces a novel method called DINER (Deep INR with Efficient Representation) to improve the representation capacity of the INR (Implicit Neural Representation) model. INR is a signal description technique that offers advantages such as Nyquist-sampling-free scaling and interpolation. However, INR's capacity is often limited by the spectral bias, which makes it easier to represent low-frequency signal components. Previous approaches have focused on encoding more frequency bases into the network, but this results in slower performance. The proposed DINER addresses this issue by rearranging the coordinates of the input signal to modulate its frequency spectrum and enhance the representation capacity of the subsequent INR model. This is achieved by mapping the input coordinates to another index using a hash-table, which is then fed into a traditional INR backbone. The paper demonstrates that the optimization of the hash-table and network parameters guarantees the same mapped signal with more low-frequency components. Experimental results show that even a small MLP-based INR model can effectively characterize signals with arbitrary arrangement orders.The key contributions of this work are:1. DINER significantly increases the representation capacity of the existing INR model by augmenting it with a hash-table for better characterization of input signals.2. DINER provides consistent mapping and representation capacity for signals with the same histogram of attributes but different arrangement orders.3. DINER's effectiveness is validated in various tasks, including 2D image and 3D video representation, lensless imaging phase retrieval, and 3D refractive index recovery in intensity diffraction tomography, achieving significant performance improvements compared to existing methods.Overall, DINER is a promising approach that enhances the capabilities of the INR model and achieves improved performance in a range of scientific tasks.
