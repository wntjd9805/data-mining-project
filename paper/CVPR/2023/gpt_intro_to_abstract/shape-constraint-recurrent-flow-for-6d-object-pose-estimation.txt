6D object pose estimation is a crucial problem in 3D computer vision with applications in robotic manipulation and augmented reality. Existing methods rely on pose refinement using optical flow networks and PnP solvers. However, these methods suffer from weaknesses such as not considering the target's 3D shape, resulting in matching noise, and using a surrogate matching loss that is suboptimal for 6D pose estimation. To address these problems, we propose a shape-constraint recurrent matching framework that incorporates the target's shape into the matching process. We build a correlation volume based on pose-induced flow and learn the object pose based on the current flow prediction, enabling an end-to-end trainable system. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
