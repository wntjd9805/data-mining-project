The goal of this computer science paper is to address the challenges of 3D reconstruction, specifically mapping a sparse set of oriented points from a shape to a 3D implicit field. Existing approaches, including classical methods and learning-based approaches, have limitations in handling large noise, sparse inputs, and generalization to out-of-distribution shapes and sampling densities. This paper builds upon the Neural Kernel Fields (NKF) approach and proposes a new gradient-based kernel formulation that is robust to noise. Additionally, an explicit voxel hierarchy structure and compactly supported kernels are used to make the interpolation problem sparse, multi-scale, and capable of handling large inputs. The proposed method can generalize to out-of-distribution inputs, be trained on diverse datasets, reconstruct point clouds consisting of millions of points in seconds, and scale to extremely large inputs. A comparison with related works is provided, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method.
