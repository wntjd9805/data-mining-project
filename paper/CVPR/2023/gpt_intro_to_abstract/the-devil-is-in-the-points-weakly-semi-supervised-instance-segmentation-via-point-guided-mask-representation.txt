Recently proposed instance segmentation methods have achieved remarkable performance by utilizing abundant segmentation labels for training. However, pixel-level annotations required for segmentation labels are costly and time-consuming compared to other label types. As a result, weakly-supervised and semi-supervised instance segmentation approaches have gained attention to reduce annotation costs. Weakly-supervised approaches use inexpensive weak labels such as image-level labels, point labels, or bounding box labels. Semi-supervised approaches employ a small amount of pixel-level labeled data and a massive amount of unlabeled data.However, there is still a large performance gap between semi-supervised approaches and fully-supervised learning methods. Semi-supervised approaches often face the challenge of balancing false-negative and false-positive samples in pseudo labels. Addressing this challenge is crucial for stable convergence of the target network.To address this challenge, this paper proposes a Weakly Semi-Supervised Instance Segmentation (WSSIS) approach with point labels. Point labels, which contain only a one-pixel categorical instance cue, can be used as an effective source to resolve the performance bottleneck and balance the trade-off between false-negative and false-positive proposals. The proposed WSSIS approach utilizes a small amount of fully labeled data and a massive amount of point labeled data for budget-efficient and high-performance instance segmentation.The WSSIS approach filters out proposals using point labels to keep only true-positive proposals. It then exploits the mask representation of the network learned from fully labeled data to produce high-quality pseudo instance masks. The approach also utilizes an Adaptive Pyramid-Level Selection strategy to handle the lack of instance size information in point labels. Additionally, a MaskRefineNet is proposed to refine rough instance masks using image, rough mask, and point information as input sources.Extensive experiments on COCO and BDD100K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The approach achieves competitive performance with fully-supervised models even with only half of the fully labeled images and the rest point labeled images. It also outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods when using a small amount of fully labeled data.In summary, this paper establishes a new training protocol for weakly semi-supervised instance segmentation with point labels. The proposed method effectively leverages point labels for budget-efficient and high-performance instance segmentation. Furthermore, the MaskRefineNet improves the quality of pseudo instance masks, and extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed approach.
