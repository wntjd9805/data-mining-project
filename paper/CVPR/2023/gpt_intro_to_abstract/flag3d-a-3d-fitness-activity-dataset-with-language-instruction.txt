This paper introduces a new dataset called FLAG3D for fitness activity analysis. The demand for fitness activities has increased in recent years, with many people opting for workout videos rather than gym memberships. However, existing datasets have limitations in modeling complex poses and describing fine-grained activities. FLAG3D overcomes these limitations by providing highly accurate and dense 3D pose data, detailed language instructions, and diverse video resources. The dataset includes sequences of 60 complex fitness activities captured from various sources, including a MoCap system, rendering software, and smartphones. The authors evaluate various tasks, including action recognition and human mesh recovery, using FLAG3D and find that current state-of-the-art methods perform well in in-domain scenarios but struggle in out-domain scenarios. The dataset provides ground truth for challenging poses and can improve current methods' performance. The contributions of this paper are twofold: the introduction of the FLAG3D dataset and empirical studies and analyses of its potential applications and future research directions in fitness activity understanding.
