The rapid growth of visual data has created a strong demand for digital image processing. One common technique used in image processing is image resampling, which involves generating new pixels from existing pixels according to geometric transformation rules. This technique has various applications, including photo editing, optical distortion compensation, online content streaming, and visual special effects production.Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown impressive progress in image resampling, but traditional interpolation methods like bicubic interpolation are often preferred due to their simplicity, efficiency, and support for arbitrary transformations. However, there is a lack of an efficient and continuous solution that combines the advantages of DNN-based methods and interpolation methods.To fill this research gap, we propose a novel method called Learning Resampling Function (LeRF). LeRF assigns parameterized continuous resampling functions to image pixels, which are learned from data. A neural network is trained to predict the hyper-parameters that determine the orientations of these resampling functions for each pixel in an input image. The output image is obtained by interpolating the input image with these locally adapted resampling functions. LeRF combines the structural priors learned by DNNs with the locally continuous assumption of interpolation methods. We also present an efficient implementation of LeRF using look-up tables (LUTs) to accelerate inference.We evaluate the performance and generalization ability of LeRF in various image resampling tasks, including arbitrary-scale upsampling, homographic transformation, and general warping. Comparative experiments demonstrate that LeRF outperforms popular interpolation methods significantly in upsampling, highlighting its superiority in terms of performance and efficiency. Our contributions in this paper include the proposal of LeRF, the efficient implementation using LUTs, and the demonstration of its effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments.
