Predictive models are crucial in robotics for solving inverse problems like planning and control. Physics-based models built on first principles have shown impressive performance in various domains. However, these models rely on complete prior knowledge of the environment, limiting their use in complex manipulation problems. As a result, there is an increasing interest in learning dynamics models directly from raw visual observations. However, working with visual data can be challenging due to its high dimensionality. Prior methods have proposed learning dynamics models over latent vectors, but this approach fails to consider the relational structure within the environment. Another strategy is to build more structured visual representations of the environment, such as particles, keypoints, and object meshes. One recent approach combines compositional neural implicit representations with graph neural networks for dynamic modeling of multi-object interactions. However, this approach only considers objects of uniform color in well-lit scenarios and does not explicitly model light transport. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs) and graph neural networks for dynamics modeling and manipulation of multi-object scenes. The OSFs explicitly model light transport and learn to approximate the cumulative radiance transfer, enabling relighting and inverse estimation of scenes involving multiple objects and changes in lighting conditions. Our method, combined with inverse parameter estimation and a graph-based neural dynamics model, improves object manipulation tasks in settings with varying lighting conditions and previously unseen object configurations. We demonstrate that our method outperforms prior methods in harsh lighting conditions and produces higher-fidelity long-term predictions. Our contributions include the use of neural scattering functions for inverse parameter estimation, modeling of scene compositionality for long-term predictions, and successful manipulation of multi-object scenes in extreme lighting conditions.
