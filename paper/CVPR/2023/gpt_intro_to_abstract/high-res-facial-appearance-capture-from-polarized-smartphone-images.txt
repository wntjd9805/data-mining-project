This paper discusses the development of virtual and mixed reality devices and the growing interest in creating digital human assets and realistic renderings of human faces. The democratization of commodity hardware has the potential to revolutionize asset creation in various applications, but the challenging problem of rendering human faces realistically from different perspectives and lighting conditions remains. Traditionally, expensive and carefully calibrated light stage capture setups have been used, but we aim to simplify this process to allow individuals to reconstruct their own faces while minimizing quality degradation. The problem of disentangling face geometry and material is highly complex, typically requiring multiple cameras and light sources with meticulous calibration. We propose a capture setup using a smartphone and inexpensive polarization foils to capture two sequences of the face, allowing for the reconstruction of high-resolution textures and face geometry. Our method produces visually impressive results, editable textures, and face geometry, making key contributions to the field.
