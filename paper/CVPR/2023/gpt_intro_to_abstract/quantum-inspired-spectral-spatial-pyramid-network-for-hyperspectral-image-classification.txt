Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are three-order tensors that capture detailed spectral and spatial information of land covers. HSI classification aims to identify land-cover categories for each pixel based on the rich spatial and spectral features. However, imbalanced samples in different categories pose a challenge for HSI classification. Traditional learning methods, such as support vector machine and K-nearest neighbors, and advanced traditional learning models, like extended morphological profile and extended multiattribute profile, have been used but fail to achieve satisfactory results. Deep learning models, especially those based on convolutional neural networks, have shown promise in simultaneously extracting features and performing classification. However, existing deep learning models for HSI classification separate the aggregation of spatial and spectral information into different modules, resulting in redundancy and inefficient exploration of their correlation. In contrast to traditional computers, quantum computers use quantum theory to process data, and quantum computation has been proven to outperform classical computation for certain problems. Quantum machine learning (QML) incorporates quantum computation into classical machine learning models to enhance their performance. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired spectral-spatial network (QSSN) for HSI feature extraction and a quantum-inspired spectral-spatial pyramid network (QSSPN) for HSI classification. The QSSN combines spatial and spectral information in the same operation, using a quantum-inspired state representation and a phase-prediction module to dynamically modulate the spatial and spectral correlations. The QSSPN consists of cascaded QSSN blocks in a pyramid structure, gradually extracting robust and expressive features for classification. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the first quantum-inspired method for HSI feature extraction and classification, the development of the QSSN and QSSPN frameworks, which aggregate spatial and spectral information simultaneously, and the demonstration that the QSSPN achieves the highest classification accuracy with low model complexity. The rest of the paper discusses related work, presents the detailed framework of the QSSN and QSSPN, provides experimental results and analysis, and concludes with a summary of the findings.
