The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the risks posed by forged or manipulated images, such as generating fake news and falsifying evidence. It emphasizes the importance of detecting image forgery in order to preserve trust and social equity. The paper introduces the concept of image forgery localization (IFL), which involves modeling the inconsistency between forged and authentic regions in an image. The authors highlight the challenges caused by post-processing techniques that aim to couple the features of forged and authentic regions, making accurate localization difficult. Previous methods using deep learning techniques have shown promise but have not effectively decoupled these features. Therefore, the paper proposes a novel method called Edge-aware Regional Message Passing Controller (ERMPC) for Image Forgery Localization. ERMPC utilizes a dynamic graph and control of message passing between forged and authentic regions to achieve effective disentanglement of their features. The paper also introduces an edge reconstruction module to obtain edge information between these regions. Overall, the paper outlines the contributions of the proposed framework and highlights its superiority over existing methods through extensive experiments on various benchmarks.
