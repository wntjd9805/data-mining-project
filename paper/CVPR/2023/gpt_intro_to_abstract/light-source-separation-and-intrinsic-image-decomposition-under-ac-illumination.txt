This paper explores the use of flickers caused by alternating current (AC) illumination in artificial light sources for intrinsic image decomposition (IID). The authors propose a method that assumes a scene illuminated by multiple AC light sources and recovers the intrinsic properties of the scene and the light sources from an image sequence captured by a high-speed camera. The method utilizes blind light source separation (LSS) via matrix factorization, followed by IID assuming the dichromatic reflection model. The authors reveal and resolve ambiguities in both LSS and IID, considering factors such as diffuse reflectance, specular highlights, and colors of the light sources. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in recovering intrinsic properties and its potential application in auto white balancing. The contributions of this study include addressing the novel problem of IID under AC illumination, providing a physics-based approach to resolving ambiguities, and confirming the method's ability to recover key properties of the scene and light sources.
