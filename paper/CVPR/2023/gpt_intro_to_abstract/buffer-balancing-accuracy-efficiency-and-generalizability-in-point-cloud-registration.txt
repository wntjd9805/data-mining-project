Point cloud registration is crucial in various computer science applications such as LiDAR SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and robotic navigation. The challenge lies in achieving a balance between efficiency, accuracy, and generalization, given the uneven data quality and domain gaps across different sensors. Existing registration techniques can be categorized into correspondences-based and correspondences-free methods. However, these methods have limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. This paper proposes a new registration framework, called BUFFER, which combines point-wise and patch-wise methods to achieve the best balance between accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability. BUFFER utilizes a novel fully convolutional architecture to predict point-wise saliencies and orientations, and a lightweight patch-based feature learner to extract efficient and general local features. It also introduces a new correspondence search mechanism to increase the inlier rate of correspondences. Experimental results show that BUFFER achieves superior performance in terms of registration recall and success rate, while being significantly faster than existing patch-wise methods. The contributions of this paper are the proposal of a new registration framework, the introduction of an equivariant fully convolutional architecture, and the introduction of a new correspondence search strategy to enhance the inlier ratio of initial correspondences.
