Computing dense correspondences between 3D shapes is a classical problem in Geometry Processing, Computer Vision, and related fields. The functional map (fmap) pipeline has become a popular tool for addressing this problem, using small matrices to encode correspondences as linear transformations across functional spaces. However, existing deep functional map pipelines lack interpretability and clear geometric content in their learned features. In contrast, other deep matching paradigms focus on optimizing and using geometric features directly for matching. In this work, we aim to demonstrate that features in deep functional map networks can have geometric significance and be used for matching via nearest neighbor search. We introduce the notion of feature completeness and show that under certain conditions, pointwise maps extracted from functional maps or via nearest neighbor search yield the same result. We propose modifications to the deep functional map pipeline to ensure compliance with these conditions, leading to significant improvements in accuracy. We also propose a modification to extrinsic feature extractors that were previously unsuccessful for deep functional maps, improving overall accuracy and bridging the gap between intrinsic and extrinsic surface-based learning. Our contributions include theoretical analysis, modifications to the deep functional map framework, and improvements to extrinsic feature extractors, enhancing the robustness and performance of deep fmap methods.
