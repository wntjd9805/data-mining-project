Determining the relative position and orientation of cameras is a widely studied problem in computer vision, with applications in SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. Traditional methods focus on 3D reconstruction using perspective cameras and intricate lens distortion models. However, an alternative approach called radial cameras has emerged, where the camera poses can be recovered without estimating the intrinsic calibration parameters. This approach assumes radially symmetric cameras and utilizes geometric constraints based on the angle of projection. In this paper, we explore the multi-view geometry of radial cameras and propose solutions for metric reconstruction with unknown radial distortion. Our contributions include formulating a 13-point calibrated minimal problem for four radial cameras, identifying internal constraints on the radial quadrifocal tensor, and designing stable and efficient solvers based on Homotopy Continuation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solvers in simulated and real experiments, providing a missing piece for efficient radial camera 3D reconstruction pipelines.
