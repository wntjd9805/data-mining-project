This paper introduces the problem of 3D human pose estimation and its significance in various computer vision applications. The existing two-stage pipeline for monocular pose estimation is discussed, highlighting the limitations and ambiguity of the second stage. Progress has been made in aggregating temporal cues using different convolutional and perceptron-based approaches. The emerging Transformer structure is also mentioned, showcasing its potential in modeling spatio-temporal correlation. However, existing Transformer-based methods suffer from computational complexity issues. To address this, the authors propose a novel attention mechanism called Spatio-Temporal Criss-cross attention (STC) that models spatial and temporal information in parallel. STC employs a two-pathway approach, where joint features are divided into two partitions and Multi-head Self-Attention is applied to each partition separately. The space pathway calculates affinity between joints in each frame, while the time pathway explores joint trajectories across frames. The learned contexts from both pathways are then combined using Multi-Layer Perceptrons. By doing so, the receptive field encompasses both spatial and temporal aspects, and the computational cost is significantly reduced compared to fully spatio-temporal attention. The authors present STCFormer, a new architecture for 3D human pose estimation, by stacking multiple STC blocks and incorporating Structure-enhanced Positional Embedding (SPE). SPE addresses the relevance of joints within the same body part by using part-aware embedding and capturing dynamic structure through spatio-temporal convolution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of STCFormer compared to state-of-the-art techniques. The main contributions of this work are identified as the introduction of the STC attention mechanism, the development of the STCFormer architecture, and the utilization of SPE for improved pose estimation performance.
