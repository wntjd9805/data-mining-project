Reactive grasping, a technique where robots can receive tools from humans and complete tasks in dynamic environments, is in high demand in industries such as factories. Previous research has focused on planning temporally smooth grasps, but few have considered semantic consistency. This paper introduces target-referenced reactive grasping, which aims to achieve smooth and consistent grasping in cluttered scenes. Unlike previous works that track objects' 6D pose, this work proposes a two-stage policy to track grasps without prior knowledge of the objects. Grasp poses and corresponding features are viewed as geometric descriptors, and matching is performed to estimate correspondences between grasps in different frames. A memory-augmented coarse-to-fine module is used to refine grasp tracking. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the method in both benchmarks and real robot scenarios, with success rates of 81.25% for single-object scenes and 81.67% for multi-object scenes.
