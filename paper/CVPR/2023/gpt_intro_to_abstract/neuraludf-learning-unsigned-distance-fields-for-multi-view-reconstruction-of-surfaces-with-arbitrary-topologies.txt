Reconstructing high-quality surfaces from multi-view images is a challenging problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Neural implicit fields, such as NeRF, have shown promise in representing complex geometry. However, existing NeRF-based methods struggle to accurately reconstruct scene geometry due to difficulties in extracting high-quality surfaces from the volume density representation. This paper introduces the use of Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) as a unified representation for both closed and open surfaces in volume rendering. The authors address the challenges of occlusion-awareness and non-differentiability at the zero-level sets in learning neural UDF fields. They propose a density function that effectively tackles these challenges and enables robust learning of surfaces with arbitrary topologies. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enables high-quality reconstruction of non-closed shapes with complex topologies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in surface reconstruction. The contributions of this paper include the incorporation of UDF into volume rendering, the introduction of an effective density function for robust optimization of distance fields, and achieving superior results for reconstructing high-quality surfaces with various topologies using UDF in volume rendering.
