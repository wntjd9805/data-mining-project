This paper introduces the concept of domain adaptation in the context of 3D-GANs for photo-realistic portrait face generation. The authors propose a domain adaptation framework that fine-tunes a pre-trained 3D-GAN using a 2D-GAN trained on a target domain. They identify the challenges of training 3D-GANs on artistically stylized datasets with arbitrary exaggerations of geometry and texture. To address these challenges, the authors propose an optimization-based method to align camera parameter distributions between domains and introduce texture, depth, and geometry regularizations to ensure high visual quality. They also redesign the discriminator training and propose a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) 3D deformation module to accommodate large geometric deformations. The proposed framework enables the training of 3D-GANs on complex and challenging artistic data. The authors also explore the use of their approach for 3D artistic avatar generation and editing, and present a new inversion method for coupled 3D-GANs. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in generating high-quality personalized stylized avatars from a single image.
