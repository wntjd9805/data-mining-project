Deep learning-based object re-ID systems heavily rely on labeled training data to achieve high accuracy. However, manually labeling large-scale training data is expensive and collecting data that contributes to high test accuracy is challenging. To address this, we propose a search and pruning (SnP) solution for constructing an efficient training set in object re-ID. Our method significantly reduces the size of the training set while maintaining re-ID accuracy. We demonstrate that the searched training set outperforms existing individual training sets and is superior to random or greedy sampling methods. Additionally, we discuss how dataset biases affect model performance and the role of our method in bridging the re-ID domain gap. Our results show that SnP leads to the best performance on the target compared to other methods, making it suitable for deploying re-ID systems in unknown test environments.
