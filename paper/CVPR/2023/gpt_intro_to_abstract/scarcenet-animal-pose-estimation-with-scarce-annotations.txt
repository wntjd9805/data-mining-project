The ability to understand animal behavior is crucial for various applications in farming, ecology, and surveillance. Animal pose estimation, which involves accurately determining the positions of animals' body parts, is a key step in understanding their behavior. However, the lack of labeled animal pose data poses a challenge for developing accurate pose estimation models. Existing approaches have tried to overcome this problem by using human pose data or synthetic animal images, but they suffer from domain gaps and limitations in pose, appearance, and background variations.In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning approach called ScarceNet for accurate animal pose estimation with limited labeled data. We use a technique called pseudo labeling, where artificial labels generated from a pretrained model are used together with labeled data to train the model. To address the issue of noisy pseudo labels, we incorporate the small-loss trick, which selects reliable pseudo labels based on their loss value. However, instead of discarding or adding regularization to high-loss samples, we identify reusable samples through an agreement check, ensuring that the model predictions for these samples are smooth and far from the decision boundary.Additionally, we introduce a student-teacher network and enforce a consistency constraint to further leverage the unlabeled data. We also modify the state-of-the-art human pose estimation network HRNet to adapt it to our pseudo label-based learning framework. We evaluate our approach on the AP-10K dataset, a challenging dataset with images from over 50 animal species. Our approach outperforms existing semi-supervised learning methods, especially when the labeled data is limited. We also test our approach on the TigDog dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to synthetic data-based approaches even with a minuscule amount of labeled data.In summary, our contributions include proposing a pseudo label-based training scheme for animal pose estimation, introducing the multi-branch HRNet to mitigate the negative effects of noisy joints, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on various animal pose benchmarks in different settings.
