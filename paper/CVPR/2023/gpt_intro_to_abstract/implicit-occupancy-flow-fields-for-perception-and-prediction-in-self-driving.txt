In this study, we aim to address the limitations of traditional autonomy systems for self-driving vehicles by proposing an object-free implicit approach called IMPLICITO. Our approach predicts both occupancy probability and flow over time directly from raw sensor data and high-definition (HD) maps. We introduce a novel architecture that incorporates global attention mechanisms using deformable convolutions and cross attention to focus on a compact set of distant regions per query. This allows for efficient evaluation of a large collection of spatio-temporal query points, focusing on areas of interest where potential interactions with the self-driving vehicle may occur. Extensive experiments on urban and highway scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms both object-based and object-free explicit methods in predicting occupancy and motion.
