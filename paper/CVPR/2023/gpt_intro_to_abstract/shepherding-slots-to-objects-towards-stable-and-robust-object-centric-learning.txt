Object-centric learning (OCL) aims to acquire object-wise representations by decomposing an image into a set of vectors corresponding to each distinct object. This enables machines to perceive the visual world in a manner similar to humans and facilitates tasks such as visual reasoning and object localization. Mainstream OCL approaches use autoencoding-based compositional generative models, with Slot Attention being the most prominent technique. Recently, OCL has been extended to multi-view images and videos, which allow models to learn spatial geometry or temporal dynamics of objects. However, obtaining data-driven inductive biases for single-view images is challenging, leading to unstable training results. This instability issue, referred to as the bleeding issue, results in inconsistent learning of object-centric representation. To address this problem, we propose a novel OCL framework called SLASH. SLASH consists of two modules, Attention Refining Kernel (ARK) and Intermediate Point Predictor and Encoder (IPPE), which guide slots to focus on objects without being distracted by the background. ARK is a learnable low-pass filter that reduces noise in the attention map, while IPPE provides positional cues to slots. We train IPPE using weak semi-supervision, where only a small subset of the dataset includes weak annotations. We validate our method on multiple datasets and demonstrate its stability and robustness in preventing the bleeding issue. Our contributions include proposing SLASH, introducing ARK and IPPE modules, and empirically proving the effectiveness of SLASH in achieving stable and robust OCL.
