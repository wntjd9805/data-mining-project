X-ray imagery security inspection plays a crucial role in detecting prohibited items in baggage or suitcase images at stations and airports. Deep learning methods, particularly computer vision and artificial intelligence algorithms, have shown promise in improving the performance of automated detection models. However, the availability of annotated X-ray security images is limited due to the difficulties in collecting them. Existing public datasets lack a large number of prohibited items and do not meet the requirements for training. Traditional offline enhancement strategies, such as rotation and re-scaling, are insufficient for improving the diversity and complexity of inter-occlusion between prohibited items in X-ray security images. Therefore, there is a need to synthesize realistic X-ray security images to enrich the diversity of prohibited items in pose, scale, and position.Some researchers have attempted to directly generate prohibited X-ray security images using deep synthesis models. However, these methods do not accurately represent the complexity of real-world X-ray security images. In this paper, we propose a color X-ray security image fusion model that superimposes prohibited items onto baggage or suitcase images. This model allows us to automatically synthesize prohibited X-ray security images and obtain annotations without the need for collecting annotated security images for training. We introduce new loss functions based on the imaging principle of X-ray and threat image projection (TIP), which optimize the comprehensive luminance-saturation fusion between the foreground item and background image.We also propose a Region-Wise Style-Controlled Fusion module to control the appearance of fused images by learning shifting and scaling modulation parameters. This module can adaptively modulate the local region of interest where prohibited items overlap with baggage images. Furthermore, an Edge-Attention module is developed to inhibit irrelevant information and enhance texture information, improving the sharpness of generated images. Both the Region-Wise Style-Controlled Fusion and Edge-Attention modules are universal and plug-and-play, making them applicable to other image fusion or synthesis models for generating high-quality images. The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our fusion model over other methods in the field of X-ray security image fusion and detection. Our synthetic images are proven to be effective in supplementing the training of prohibited item detection models in downstream tasks. Overall, our work contributes to the advancement of generating realistic X-ray security images for improved detection accuracy.
