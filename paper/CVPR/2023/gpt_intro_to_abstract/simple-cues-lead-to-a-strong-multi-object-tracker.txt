Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves finding the trajectories of multiple moving objects in a video. The traditional approach to MOT is tracking-by-detection, which consists of frame-wise object detection and data association to link the detections and form trajectories. Data association is often performed using cues such as appearance and motion.Recently, trackers based on Transformers have emerged, which learn all necessary cues from data through self- and cross-attention. While this approach eliminates the need for handcrafted cues, the training strategies are complex and require a large amount of data. In many cases, MOT datasets are insufficient, and pre-training on detection datasets is necessary.In this paper, we question whether we should solely rely on learning-based approaches for MOT or consider leveraging prior knowledge of appearance and motion cues. We argue that there are key observations that have been overlooked by the community. By properly understanding and implementing these cues, we can develop a simple Hungarian tracker with appearance and motion cues that outperforms state-of-the-art trackers, without the need for training on MOT data.Our first observation is that state-of-the-art re-identification (reID) networks, which are commonly used for appearance matching, are not sufficient for MOT scenarios. We identify two problems causing weak performance: reID models need to account for different challenges at different time horizons, and reID performance tends to be inconsistent across MOT sequences due to varying image statistics. To address these problems, we propose on-the-fly domain adaptation and different policies for active and inactive tracks.Furthermore, we conduct an extensive analysis under different conditions to determine when reID is not enough and when a motion model is necessary. We combine reID with a simple linear motion model using a weighted sum to give each cue more weight when needed.Our proposed Good Old Hungarian Simple Tracker (GHOST) generalizes to four different datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance without being trained on any tracking dataset. In summary, this paper makes the following contributions: (1) key design choices that enhance the performance of reID models for MOT, (2) an analysis of situations where appearance is insufficient and motion cues are required, and (3) the development of GHOST, a simple yet effective tracker that combines appearance and motion cues.By highlighting the importance of domain-specific knowledge and the impact it can have, we aim to inspire future work in integrating such observations into more sophisticated models to further advance the state of the art in MOT.
