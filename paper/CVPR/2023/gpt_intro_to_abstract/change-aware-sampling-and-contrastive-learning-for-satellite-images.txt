Satellites collect a vast amount of visual data that can be used to address global issues such as climate change. However, labeled data is required to train models effectively, and labeling satellite images is expensive and challenging due to the unique expertise needed. In this paper, we explore the use of self-supervised learning techniques to learn feature representations from unlabeled satellite images, reducing the reliance on labeled data. We discuss the limitations of applying standard self-supervised learning techniques to satellite imagery and propose leveraging the spatio-temporal structure of these images for better self-supervised learning. We highlight the availability of multiple temporally-spaced images for the same location and the spatial rarity of permanent change as important aspects of the structure of satellite images. We introduce a novel loss function, called Change-aware Contrastive Loss (CaCo), that considers both short-term variations and long-term changes in feature representations. Additionally, we present an improved geographical sampling strategy that enhances the usefulness of the dataset for learning general representations. Our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in various downstream tasks, including landcover classification, semantic segmentation, and change detection. In summary, this paper contributes a new self-supervised learning loss, a robust estimation approach for detecting significant change, and an improved geographical sampling strategy for satellite imagery representation learning.
