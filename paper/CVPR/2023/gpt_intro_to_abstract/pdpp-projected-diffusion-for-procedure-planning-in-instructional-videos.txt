Instructional videos are a valuable source of knowledge, but teaching AI agents to understand and learn from them is a significant challenge. Procedure planning in instructional videos involves generating action plans to achieve desired goals, and previous approaches have relied on complex models and heavy supervision. In this paper, we propose a new approach that treats procedure planning as a distribution fitting problem and solves it with a sampling process. Our model directly models the joint distribution of the entire action sequence in instructional videos, simplifying the training process and reducing the number of learning objectives. We also introduce a novel projected diffusion model (PDPP) to address the uncertainty inherent in procedure planning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three instructional video datasets and can even perform well with minimal supervision. Overall, this work presents a promising approach to improving AI understanding and learning from instructional videos.
