This paper introduces a data-driven approach for learning distortion-aware local segmentations that are optimal for local parameterization on 3D meshes. Unlike traditional heuristics-based methods, this approach uses a novel differentiable parameterization layer and self-supervised training to predict surface patches and corresponding UV maps with low distortion. The proposed system, called DA Wand, incorporates soft segmentation probabilities into the parameterization layer using a weighted version of the LSCM method. By harmonizing the competing objectives of reducing UV map distortion and maximizing segmentation area, this approach achieves improved optimization results. A novel near-developable segmentation dataset is used to initialize the weights of the segmentation network, and the network is trained end-to-end on unlabelled natural shapes. DA Wand allows users to interactively select a triangle on a mesh and obtain a large, meaningful region with low distortion for UV parameterization. The neural network is capable of extending segmentations using global information, unlike existing heuristic methods. The efficiency and effectiveness of DA Wand are demonstrated through an interactive application, showing its superiority over alternative techniques.
