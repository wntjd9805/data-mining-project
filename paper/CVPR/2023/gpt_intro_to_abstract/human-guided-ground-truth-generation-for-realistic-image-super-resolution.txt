This paper introduces the concept of image super-resolution (ISR) and the advancements achieved through deep learning techniques. The current ISR models are trained on a large number of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs. However, the generation of LR-HR image pairs is critical for the real-world performance of ISR models. Most existing methods use HR images as ground truths (GTs) and synthesize LR images through bicubic downsampling or other methods. Unfortunately, these methods fail to generalize to real-world images with complex degradation processes. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a human-guided GT data generation strategy to train more perceptually realistic ISR models. Multiple image enhancement models are trained to improve the perceptual quality of HR images, and human subjects are introduced to annotate the enhanced HR images based on their visual quality. This human-guided multiple-GT image dataset allows the generation of positive and negative LR-GT training pairs, enabling the training of Real-ISR models. The effectiveness and advantages of this strategy are demonstrated through extensive experiments, showing that Real-ISR models produce more realistic details with fewer artifacts compared to models trained on current datasets.
