The paper introduces the concept of region-controlled text-to-image generation (T2I), which aims to generate high-fidelity images based on input text queries that describe specific image content. The authors highlight the limitations of traditional text-only queries in terms of controllability and propose a new approach that combines open-ended text descriptions with spatial positions. This new approach, called ReCo (Region-Controlled T2I), extends pre-trained T2I models to understand coordinate inputs using position tokens. By fine-tuning the model with these extended input queries, users can provide precise descriptions for arbitrary image regions, resulting in more accurate and desired image generation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of ReCo through extensive experiments and evaluations, showing improved region control accuracy and image generation quality compared to traditional T2I models. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of T2I generation by introducing a novel approach that enhances region control and improves the generation of challenging scenes.
