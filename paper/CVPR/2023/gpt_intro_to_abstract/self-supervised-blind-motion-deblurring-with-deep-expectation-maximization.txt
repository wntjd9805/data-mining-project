This paper addresses the problem of removing uniform and non-uniform motion blur caused by camera shake from an image. It introduces a dataset-free deep learning method that combines DNN-based re-parameterization and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike existing methods, which are limited to uniform blur, this approach can handle both uniform and non-uniform motion blur. It utilizes the space-variant overlap-add (SVOLA) formulation to model motion blur of static scenes and incorporates prior knowledge of the physics of motion blur. The proposed method achieves superior performance in recovering images affected by motion blur compared to existing solutions. The main contributions of this paper include the development of the first dataset-free deep learning method for removing general motion blur from images and the combination of DNN-based re-parameterization and the EM algorithm, bridging the gap between classical non-learning algorithms and deep learning. This approach has potential applications in other image recovery tasks.
