The paper discusses the problem of limited generalization power in computer vision applications due to a single scene-generic detector. It proposes the use of scene-specific detectors to improve detection performance and customize the detector for each scene. The paper introduces a self-supervised method to adapt a pre-trained detector to each scene by generating augmented training data based on detections made by the pre-trained model. Multiple detectors are used in a cross-teaching manner, and two additional techniques, location-aware object mixup and background-augmented input, are proposed to boost detection performance. The main contribution of the paper is a novel framework that utilizes self-supervision, location-aware object mixup, and background modeling, along with a large-scale dataset for the development of scene-adaptive object detection.
