In this paper, we address the problem of multi-view clustering, where data is collected from diverse sources in various domains and described by multiple feature sets. Each view contains partial and complementary information, which together agree on a consensus latent representation. We classify existing multi-view clustering methods into four categories based on their mechanisms: co-training, multi-kernel learning, multi-task multi-view clustering, and graph-based methods. While these methods have shown empirical success, they still have limitations in considering the topological structure of data and the correlation between views. To overcome these limitations, we propose a collaborative model that leverages topological structure learning and sample-level graph fusion. Experimental results on various multi-view datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
