Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, which involves localizing and recognizing objects in images. With the advancement of deep neural networks (DNN), the performance of object detectors has significantly improved. In recent years, there has been a trend to remove hand-crafted components and achieve end-to-end detection. One such component is the design of training samples, particularly the use of anchor boxes. While anchor-based detectors have been widely used, they are sensitive to the shape and size of the boxes.Other hand-crafted components include non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove duplicated predictions and the one-to-many (o2m) label assignment, which assigns multiple positive samples to each ground truth object during training. Both NMS and o2m label assignment can have drawbacks and add additional costs to the detection process.The DETR model, based on the transformer architecture, has shown competitive end-to-end detection performance. This has led to the introduction of the one-to-one (o2o) label assignment in fully convolutional network (FCN) based dense detectors for lightweight end-to-end detection. However, o2o can impede training efficiency, particularly in dense detectors with a large number of anchors. Additionally, semantically similar anchors can be mislabeled as positive and negative anchors, decreasing the discrimination of feature representation.To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient FCN-based dense detector that is NMS-free yet end-to-end trainable. The key idea is to assign dynamic soft classification labels to ambiguous anchors that are semantically similar to positive samples. These ambiguous anchors are labeled as partially positive and partially negative, with the degrees of positive and negative labels adaptively adjusted during training. The proposed method, named one-to-few (o2f) label assignment, aims to strike a balance between representation learning and removing duplicated predictions.The o2f label assignment is instantiated into the dense detector FCOS, and experiments on COCO and CrowHuman datasets demonstrate that it achieves comparable or even better performance than detectors with NMS. This approach offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate object detection in computer vision tasks.
