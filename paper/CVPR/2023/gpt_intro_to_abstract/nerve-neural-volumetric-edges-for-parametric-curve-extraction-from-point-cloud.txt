This paper introduces the concept of NerVE, a neural volumetric edge representation for extracting structured features from noisy and unstructured point clouds. The paper highlights the limitations of existing methods in accurately detecting edge points and accurately locating endpoints. The authors propose predicting structured edges in the form of piece-wise linear (PWL) curves, which simplifies the extraction process and eliminates the need for curve topology estimation. The paper presents the NerVE framework, which represents 3D structured edges using a regular grid of volumetric cubes. The advantages of using NerVE include simplified curve extraction, compatibility with PWL curve representation, robustness in detecting curves, and the ability to use 3D convolutional networks for inference. The paper also describes a post-processing procedure for correcting potential topology errors in the resulting curves. The proposed method is evaluated on a large-scale dataset of CAD models and outperforms existing methods in extracting complete and accurate edges and parametric curves. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of NerVE, a pipeline for parametric curve extraction, and the achievement of a new state-of-the-art in the task of parametric curve extraction from point clouds.
