In recent years, there has been significant attention on 3D object detection from point clouds, due to its wide range of applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Current state-of-the-art 3D detectors still rely on dense predictions with post-processing techniques to obtain final sparse detections. However, this indirect pipeline requires many hand-crafted components and involves considerable effort for tuning, preventing dense detectors from being optimized end-to-end. On the other hand, recent advancements in 2D detectors based on DETR (DEtection TRansformer) show that transformers with direct sparse predictions can simplify the detection pipeline and improve performance. Despite efforts to apply direct sparse predictions to 3D object detection, sparse detectors still lag behind state-of-the-art dense detectors. This is because images and point clouds have different characteristics, with images being dense and ordered, while point clouds are sparse and irregular. To achieve direct sparse predictions, DETR-based detectors adopt a set of object queries and use the Hungarian Matching algorithm to assign ground truths to these queries. However, to ensure high recall rates, these detectors often use more queries than the actual number of objects in a scene. This approach leads to densely overlapped false positives, particularly in scenes with small and densely populated objects. The existing Hungarian Matching only assigns ground truths to their best matched queries, while ignoring all other unmatched queries near the ground truth. This lack of effective suppression for unmatched queries results in duplicated false positives. In this paper, we propose a Query Contrast strategy to address this limitation and achieve accurate predictions with reduced false positives. Our strategy involves constructing positive and negative GT-query pairs and using contrastive learning to supervise both matched and unmatched queries. We integrate this Query Contrast mechanism into our baseline Voxel-DETR to create a new sparse 3D detector called ConQueR. Our detector significantly improves detection performance and sparsity of predictions, surpassing the state-of-the-art on the challenging Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). The contributions of this paper include introducing the Query Contrast strategy to effectively eliminate densely overlapped false positives, proposing multi-positive contrastive training to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Query Contrast mechanism, and closing the gap between sparse and dense 3D detectors with the ConQueR detector.
