Decomposing a video into meaningful layers is a challenging problem in computer science. Previous approaches, using 2D modeling and homography warping, have limitations when it comes to camera motions with parallax. In this paper, we propose a new method that leverages recent advancements in object grouping and monocular video depth estimation to handle camera parallax and improve the accuracy of layer decomposition. We also introduce regularization terms based on multi-view consistency and smoothness priors to resolve the ill-posed decomposition problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by accurately separating an input video into background and object layers, even in the presence of complex object and camera motion.
