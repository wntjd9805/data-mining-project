This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently storing and transferring high-resolution (HR) images on the cloud. While storing low-resolution (LR) counterparts on mobile devices can save storage space, downloading the full-resolution image from the cloud can be problematic when internet connection is unreliable. Real-time image rescaling is proposed as a solution to improve user experience. Existing rescaling methods have limitations, such as loss of details and sub-optimal performance. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose the HyperThumbnail framework, which embeds HR images into low-bitrate JPEG thumbnails and efficiently reconstructs HR images in real time using an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture. The framework also incorporates rate-distortion optimization to improve image quality and compression efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to existing methods in terms of image quality, reconstruction speed, and file size.
