The introduction of the computer science paper discusses the importance of 3D traffic scene understanding in autonomous driving systems. It highlights the advantages of representing objects with detailed 3D shapes compared to simple bounding boxes. The paper mentions the use of specific devices like LiDAR and stereo vision for acquiring precise 3D information, but also notes the limitations of scalability and cost. The study of monocular vision for 3D perception is also discussed, noting that it is a challenging problem due to the loss of depth information. Previous research in image-based 3D object detection and reconstruction using geometric constraints is mentioned, but the need for leveraging relative context among objects and global scene context is emphasized. The paper introduces a novel algorithm called BAAM that utilizes bi-contextual attention and attention-guided modeling for 3D pose and shape estimation. The algorithm extracts various 2D primitive features and constructs object features to embed internal object structures. Shape priors are introduced to represent vehicle shapes in detail. The proposed BAAM algorithm reconstructs objects' 3D shapes using attention-guided modeling and estimates objects' poses using bi-contextual attention. A 3D non-maximum suppression algorithm is also developed to remove spurious objects. Extensive experiments on datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, outperforming existing methods in pose and shape estimation. The main contributions of the work include the attention-guided modeling, bi-contextual attention module, novel 3D non-maximum suppression algorithm, and the achievement of state-of-the-art performance.
