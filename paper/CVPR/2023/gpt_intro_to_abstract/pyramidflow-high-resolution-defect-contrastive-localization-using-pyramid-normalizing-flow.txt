Automated machine vision inspection has become an increasingly important aspect of quality control in industrial manufacturing processes. While manual inspection has been relied upon for a long time, it is challenging to detect defects in large-scale images and tiny anomalies with human visual perception alone. Supervised deep learning methods have shown great success in this domain by utilizing annotated datasets to learn discriminative features. However, these approaches face challenges such as insufficient negative samples, high demand for labels, and absence of prior knowledge, which limit their effectiveness in identifying unseen defects. To overcome these limitations, unsupervised methods have been explored for defect detection. Reconstruction-based methods take reconstructed images as templates and apply explicit contrast in image space to achieve high-resolution localization. However, reconstructing complex details using decoders is difficult. Anomaly-based methods, on the other hand, utilize texture-aware pre-trained models and achieve high image-level performance but at the cost of pixel-level visual performance. Convolutional normalizing flows have emerged as a promising solution by modeling the probability distribution from pre-trained features.In this paper, we propose a Pyramid Normalizing Flow (Pyramid-Flow) for anomaly localization. Pyramid-Flow introduces the concept of templates from image space into latent space using normalizing flow, enabling high-resolution anomaly localization through contrast enhancement. The proposed method includes the multi-scale Pyramid Coupling Block, which incorporates invertible pyramids and volume normalization, to construct a volume-preserving PyramidFlow. To the best of our knowledge, PyramidFlow is the first UNet-like fully normalizing flow specifically designed for anomaly localization. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. The proposal of a latent template-based defect contrastive localization paradigm that reduces intra-class variance and avoids ill-posedness associated with reconstruction-based methods.2. The development of PyramidFlow, which includes invertible pyramids, pyramid coupling blocks, and volume normalization for multi-scale fusing and mapping, leading to high-resolution defect localization with improved generalization.3. Comprehensive experiments that demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to comparable algorithms that do not use external priors, achieving state-of-the-art performance in complex scenarios.
