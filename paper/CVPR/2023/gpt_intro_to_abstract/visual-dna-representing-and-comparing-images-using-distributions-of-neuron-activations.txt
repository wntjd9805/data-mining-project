Being able to compare datasets and understand their differences is crucial for various applications in computer science. This includes tasks such as selecting the best labeled dataset for training a model in a new application domain, determining the quality of synthesized images, and mitigating dataset biases. However, current methods for dataset comparison are limited, with coarse or insufficient metadata available. In addition, there is a lack of automated methods to measure dataset similarities, making it challenging to make informed decisions.To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Distributions of Neuron Activations (DNAs) for representing datasets. DNAs are created by passing images through a pre-trained frozen feature extraction model and fitting distributions to the observed neuron activations. This representation captures multi-granular feature information and allows for customized comparisons by controlling attributes of interest. Importantly, DNAs can be computed without the need for high-dimensional feature spaces, specific processing algorithms, model training, or manual labeling.We demonstrate the effectiveness of DNAs in various tasks, including comparing images to images, images to datasets, and datasets to datasets. Additionally, we show how DNAs can be utilized for attribute-based comparisons, synthetic image quality assessment, and predicting cross-dataset generalization. Our approach offers a practical and efficient solution for dataset comparison and has the potential to greatly enhance various computer science applications.
