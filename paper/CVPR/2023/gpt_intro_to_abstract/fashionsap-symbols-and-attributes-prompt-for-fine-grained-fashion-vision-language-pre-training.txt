Abstract: This paper introduces a vision-language pre-training (VLP) method for the fashion domain, focusing on learning fine-grained attributes of fashion items. General VLP models are not effective in capturing the detailed attributes of fashion items, which are important for retrieval and recommendation services in the online retail market. To address this, we propose a method that incorporates fashion categories as a global concept layer during pre-training. We also define nine fashion symbols corresponding to human body parts to unify the categories of fashion items. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four popular fashion tasks, providing new baselines for further research. The contributions of this work are an effective pre-training model for learning fashion knowledge, a fashion concept layer, and an attributes prompt method for explicitly learning fine-grained fashion characteristics.
