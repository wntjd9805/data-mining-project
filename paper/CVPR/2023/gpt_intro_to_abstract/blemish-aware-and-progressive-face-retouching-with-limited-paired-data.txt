With the increasing demand for facial image beautification in social media, there is a need for facial skin retouching methods that can remove blemishes while preserving the stable characteristics associated with face identity. Conventional methods based on blind smoothing may remove relevant facial characteristics and professional face retouching can be expensive and requires specialized expertise, hindering large-scale data collection for model training. This paper proposes a two-stage progressive face retouching model called Blemish-aware Progressive Face Retouching (BPFRe) that combines the strengths of encoder-decoder and generator architectures. The first stage performs coarse retouching using an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections for better content reconstruction. The second stage modifies the generator architecture of StyleGAN to operate on multi-scale intermediate features and render images with finer details. Two blemish-aware attention modules are incorporated to refine the information transfer between components and enable progressive retouching. Unpaired training data is leveraged to optimize the discriminator and guide the generator in synthesizing realistic details. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and wild data are performed to evaluate the proposed model. The contributions of this work include the integration of encoder-decoder and generator architectures, the incorporation of blemish-aware attention modules, and the use of unpaired training data to reduce dependence on paired data.
