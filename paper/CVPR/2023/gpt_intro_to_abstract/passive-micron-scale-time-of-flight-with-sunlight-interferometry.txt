This paper introduces a completely passive micron-scale 3D sensing technique that utilizes sunlight as the only light source. Existing contactless imaging techniques for micron-scale 3D sensing require active illumination, making them impractical for outdoor use or power-constrained applications. Passive 3D sensing techniques achieve resolutions of only hundreds of micrometers. The proposed technique overcomes these limitations by using interferometry and capturing full-frame time-of-flight measurements at axial resolutions of 5 micrometers. The technique takes advantage of the spatial incoherence of sunlight to enable robust 3D sensing in the presence of severe indirect illumination effects. An experimental prototype is built and operated outdoors under adverse conditions to demonstrate the capabilities of the technique. The results show the possibility of performing passive depth scanning with pixel-level lateral resolution and micrometer axial resolution for challenging objects. The paper also discusses the potential impact of interferometry in outdoor applications such as field inspection, field robotics, and field medicine, highlighting the benefits of passive operation in terms of cost, power consumption, and portability.
