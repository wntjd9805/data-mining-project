Abstract:Preserving cultural heritage, especially traditional wooden buildings, is a crucial task that involves managing architectural drawings, photos, and 3D scan data. However, many archived drawings, which hold significant value, have degraded over time, making it challenging to interpret information. In this paper, we propose a restoration method using a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to restore aged hand-drawn architectural drawings. The method consists of two stages: training a VQ-VAE to learn latent space representations of clean drawings and then mapping latent space variables of noisy drawings to those of clean drawings using a degradation generator. The proposed method is applied to restore archived drawings of traditional wooden buildings, and its performance is compared to other restoration methods. The results show significant improvement in restoration performance, especially for actual aged drawings, and the proposed degradation generator produces more authentic degraded drawings. The novelty of our method lies in its effectiveness, improved performance, and the development of a realistic degradation generator for data augmentation.
