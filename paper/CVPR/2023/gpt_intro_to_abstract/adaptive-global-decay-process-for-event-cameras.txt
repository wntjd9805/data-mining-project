This abstract introduces the concept of event cameras, which are data-driven sensors that capture visual data asynchronously and in response to pixel-wise brightness changes. These cameras offer advantages such as high temporal resolution, low latency, low power consumption, and high dynamic range. However, their unique sensing paradigm poses challenges in fully exploiting their capabilities. The paper focuses on event processing strategies and the decay of event relevance over time. It discusses three existing decay strategies and their limitations. The paper proposes a novel decay process that adapts to the global scene dynamics, introduces negligible latency, and consistently generates sharp edge-like frames. The working principle of event cameras is also explained, highlighting the asynchronous stream of temporal contrast events they produce. These events represent spatio-temporal brightness changes and are generated based on a threshold and the change in log-brightness. The paper emphasizes the challenges in decoding the different contributions encoded in each event and suggests that a global decay process can indirectly capture these dynamics.
