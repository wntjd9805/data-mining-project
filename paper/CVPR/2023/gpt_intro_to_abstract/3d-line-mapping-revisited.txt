This paper introduces a robust pipeline for mapping 3D lines, which offers stronger geometric clues about scene layout compared to traditional point mapping methods. The pipeline utilizes structural priors such as coincidence and parallelism to improve the reconstruction of line segments and their associations with 3D points and vanishing points. While line mapping methods face challenges such as inconsistent endpoints, line fragmentation, and weaker descriptor-based matching, the proposed pipeline addresses these challenges and achieves more complete and accurate line maps. The framework is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing point-based structure-from-motion frameworks. The authors evaluate the performance of the pipeline on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. The paper also showcases the usefulness of robust line maps in tasks like visual localization and bundle adjustment in structure-from-motion.
