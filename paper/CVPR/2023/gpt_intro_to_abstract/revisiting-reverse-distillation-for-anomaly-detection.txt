Detecting anomalies in computer vision is essential for various applications, but the cost of collecting abnormal samples can be high. Unsupervised anomaly detection using abnormal-free samples can help reduce this cost. Previous approaches, such as generative adversarial models and pre-trained CNN backbones, have limitations in terms of computational expense and performance. Another approach involving knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student network, but there are limitations in the similarity of network architectures. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a reverse distillation approach called RD++ that achieves high accuracy and fast inference. RD++ incorporates self-supervised optimal transport for feature compactness and simulates pseudo-abnormal samples with simplex noise for anomalous signal suppression. The proposed approach is tested on various datasets and shows state-of-the-art performance in detection and localization, with real-time capability that is at least twice as fast as comparable methods.
