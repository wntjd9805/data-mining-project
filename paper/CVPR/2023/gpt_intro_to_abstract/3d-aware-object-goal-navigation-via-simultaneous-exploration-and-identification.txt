The paper introduces the concept of object goal navigation (ObjectNav), which involves finding a specific object in an unknown scene. Existing methods for ObjectNav use either end-to-end reinforcement learning or modular-based approaches. While end-to-end methods achieve competitive performance, they are not sample-efficient and struggle with generalization. Therefore, the paper focuses on modular-based methods, which consist of semantic scene mapping, goal policy, and local path planning modules. However, existing modular-based methods mainly use 2D maps or scene graphs, which are limited in leveraging 3D spatial information. To address this limitation, the paper proposes a 3D-aware ObjectNav framework that utilizes a 3D semantic scene map. This 3D representation offers more accurate and consistent semantic predictions. However, leveraging 3D scene representation presents challenges in terms of computational cost and high-dimensional observations. To overcome these challenges, the paper introduces an online semantic point fusion module for 3D semantic scene mapping and two parallel policy networks for exploration and object identification. The framework also incorporates a local path planning module. By factoring the navigation policy into exploration and identification sub-policies, the learning process is simplified. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better performance than existing modular-based navigation strategies, with higher efficiency and success rates at reduced computational cost. The main contributions of the paper include the development of a 3D-aware framework for ObjectNav, an online point-based construction and fusion algorithm for floor-level 3D scene representation, and a simultaneous two-policy mechanism to improve sample efficiency in 3D-aware ObjectNav policy learning.
