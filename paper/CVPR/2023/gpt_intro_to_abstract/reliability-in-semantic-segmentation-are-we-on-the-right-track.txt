Deep neural networks, despite their impressive performance on various tasks, often suffer from overconfidence and tend to predict with high confidence even when they are wrong. This problem is exacerbated under domain shifts, where models tend to underperform. While these vulnerabilities affect deep models in general, they have been primarily studied in the context of classification models and have received less attention in the domain of semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, with applications in autonomous driving and medical imaging, where domain shifts are common. Therefore, addressing the issues of brittle performance and overconfidence under domain shifts is crucial for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence systems. In this study, we aim to evaluate the robustness and uncertainty estimation of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models to determine whether advancements are being made in these areas. We assess these models in terms of in-domain vs. out-of-domain prediction quality, calibration, misclassification detection, and out-of-domain detection. Unlike previous studies that focused on synthetic corruptions as domain shifts, we consider natural, realistic domain shifts captured in different conditions. Task-specific studies are important because architectures and learning algorithms designed for specific tasks may exhibit different behaviors. Our analysis reveals that while there have been remarkable improvements in the robustness of segmentation models under domain shifts, their calibration remains poor. Furthermore, content-dependent calibration strategies show promise in improving reliability out of domain. We also observe that recent models perform differently in terms of misclassification detection and out-of-domain detection in comparison to the ResNet baseline, and a small ResNet-18 backbone performs best in out-of-domain detection. Overall, our study provides insights into the progress and areas of improvement in robustness and uncertainty estimation for a wide range of segmentation models, offering valuable guidance to practitioners and researchers in the field.
