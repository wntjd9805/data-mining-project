Object-goal visual navigation requires an agent to consecutively move towards a specific object category without prior knowledge of the environment. This involves representing visual observations, estimating navigation states, and predicting actions. Existing approaches focus on extracting informative visual representations but often result in highly-correlated navigation states, leading to inefficient navigation policies. To address this issue, we propose the History-inspired Navigation Learning (HiNL) framework. It consists of a History-aware State Estimation (HaSE) module and a History-based State Regularization (HbSR). HaSE analyzes correlations among historical navigation states and eliminates the influence of dominant states on current state estimation, enabling the agent to dynamically react to visual observations. HbSR enforces low correlations between each state and its preceding states, preventing the emergence of highly correlated states. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HiNL in artificial environments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in success rate and path length. Our contributions include the HiNL framework, the HaSE module, and the HbSR constraint for effective navigation state estimation.
