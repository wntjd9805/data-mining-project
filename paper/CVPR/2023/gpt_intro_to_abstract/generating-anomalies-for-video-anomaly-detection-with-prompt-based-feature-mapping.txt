Abstract:Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a crucial role in public security by identifying abnormal scenarios in surveillance videos. However, detecting rare and unconstrained abnormal events in real-life surveillance is challenging. Most existing VAD approaches learn the distribution of normal events during training and detect out-of-distribution events during testing. However, these approaches struggle to detect unseen anomalies due to the strong generalization ability of deep networks and the similarity between normal and abnormal events. To overcome this limitation, some methods generate pseudo anomalies to simulate the distribution of abnormal behaviors. However, there is still a gap between pseudo and natural anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called prompt-based feature mapping framework (PFMF) to address the limitations of existing methods. The PFMF utilizes a prompt-guided mapping network to generate unbounded anomalies through a divergent mapping process, thus narrowing the anomaly gap. Additionally, we introduce a mapping adaptation branch to handle scene-specific anomalies and attributes, reducing inconsistency caused by scene-specific factors. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on three public VAD datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
