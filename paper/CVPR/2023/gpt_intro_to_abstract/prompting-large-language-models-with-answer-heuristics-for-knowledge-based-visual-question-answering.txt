Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in visual question answering (VQA), where machines answer questions about images. However, current methods still struggle with reasoning abilities, particularly when external knowledge is required. In this paper, we focus on the task of knowledge-based VQA, where external knowledge is necessary to answer questions. We explore the use of explicit knowledge bases (KBs) and pretrained language models, such as GPT-3, as implicit knowledge engines for knowledge acquisition. We discuss the limitations of existing approaches and propose a new framework called Prophet, which prompts GPT-3 with answer heuristics to enhance its capacity for knowledge-based VQA. Prophet introduces two types of answer heuristics, namely answer candidates and answer-aware examples, to overcome the limitations of existing methods. We show that Prophet outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on challenging datasets and is reproducible with a single GPU and an affordable number of GPT-3 invocations.
