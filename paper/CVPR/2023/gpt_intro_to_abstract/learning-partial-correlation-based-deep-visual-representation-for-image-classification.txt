Learning effective visual representation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. In recent years, the use of covariance matrix based pooling methods has gained attention due to its ability to exploit second-order correlation information. However, covariance matrix only measures pairwise correlation and ignores the influence of other variables. To address this limitation, we propose the integration of sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) into convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification. This integration enables us to capture the partial correlation between feature components by regressing out the effects of other variables. Estimating the inverse covariance matrix from CNN feature maps is a challenging task due to the small spatial size and high number of channels. To solve this problem, we introduce a fast end-to-end training method called iterative sparse inverse covariance estimation (iSICE) that efficiently integrates SICE into CNN. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be easily implemented with existing deep learning libraries. Our contributions include the development of a novel layer for CNN that utilizes SICE, the minimal change required in network architecture, and the proposal of a modulating network to achieve optimal learning rate and sparsity penalty. Experimental results on multiple image classification datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed iSICE method.
