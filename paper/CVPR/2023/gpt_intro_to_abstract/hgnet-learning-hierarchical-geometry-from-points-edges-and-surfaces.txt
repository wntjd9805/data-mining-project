Abstract:The field of 3D point cloud analysis has rapidly developed in recent years due to the increasing popularity of 3D acquisition technologies. Point cloud analysis has a wide range of applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. However, analyzing 3D point cloud data is challenging because it lacks the structured nature of 2D RGB image data. Previous efforts have focused on interpreting the geometry information in unstructured point clouds using various representations. This work proposes a hierarchical approach to comprehensively characterize point clouds by parsing them into constituent local geometry structures. A bottom-up local hierarchical topology is constructed, consisting of points, edges, surfaces, and super-surfaces. This hierarchical structure enhances the learning of multi-granular geometry features in a top-down manner. To facilitate this, the Hierarchical Geometry Network (HGNet) is introduced, which incorporates a Transformer structure to unify refined surface-level, edge-level, and point-level geometry features with contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGNet outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in various 3D vision tasks, achieving the best overall accuracy in the ScanObjectNN benchmark and improved performance in part and semantic segmentation tasks on the PartNet and S3DIS datasets.
