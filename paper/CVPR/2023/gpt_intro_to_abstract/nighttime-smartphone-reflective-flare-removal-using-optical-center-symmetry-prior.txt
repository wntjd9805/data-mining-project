Lens flare artifacts can occur in photographs when strong light enters the camera's field of view, causing scattering and reflection within the lenses. Reflective flares appear as groups of bright spots or a "ghosting effect" in the captured images. Traditional methods for removing these flares rely on feature detection techniques, but struggle to effectively detect blobs on complex backgrounds and are ineffective for certain types of reflective flares. Existing datasets for reflective flare removal also lack diversity and are insufficient for generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel optical center symmetry prior, which suggests that the main spot of the reflective flare and the light source are always symmetrical around the lens's optical center. Leveraging this prior, we develop a new dataset called BracketFlare that includes various types of light sources and diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. In order to generate the dataset, we use continuous bracketing to capture the light source's pattern and synthesize reflective flares based on the characteristics of flares and the light source's patterns. Furthermore, we design an end-to-end reflective flare removal pipeline that incorporates the optical center symmetry prior in training data generation and network structures. We conduct extensive experiments on our dataset, training two CNN-based networks and two Transformer-based networks. The results show that our proposed dataset and pipeline effectively remove reflective flares and generalize well to different night scenes. The contributions of this work include the introduction of the optical center symmetry prior, the creation of the BracketFlare dataset, and the development of an end-to-end pipeline for reflective flare removal.
