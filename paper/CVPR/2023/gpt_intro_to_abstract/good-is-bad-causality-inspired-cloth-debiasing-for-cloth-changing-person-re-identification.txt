Short-term person Re-Identification (ReID) aims to match individuals in limited time and space conditions, assuming consistent clothing. However, current ReID methods are susceptible to deception when pedestrians alter their clothing. This motivates the exploration of Cloth-Changing person ReID (CC-ReID), which is critical for tracking disguised criminal suspects. Clothing plays a dual role in person identification, either confusing identity perception or clearly distinguishing different IDs. Traditional ReID methods rely on clothing as a helpful characteristic, but the entangled representation of clothing and ID leads to biased classification. Deep learning attempts to model discriminative clues for person identification, but non-ID areas such as clothing often correlate highly with ID. Conventional ReID methods focus on image regions with distinct discrimination characteristics, leading to biased classification. To address this issue, we propose a Causal Auto-Intervention Model (AIM) for CC-ReID, which captures clothing bias and ID clues separately and eliminates the influence of clothing on ID representation learning. AIM utilizes a dual-branch model to simulate the causal intervention process and gradually removes clothing bias without damaging semantic integrity. We introduce two learning objectives to encourage clothing mitigation and demonstrate the impact of clothing bias on the ReID model. Experimental results on two CC-ReID datasets show that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the significance of causal inference in CC-ReID. Our contributions include the introduction of causality-based intervention in CC-ReID, the proposal of a dual-branch model for simulating causal intervention, and comprehensive demonstrations of the effects of clothing bias and the effectiveness of AIM in CC-ReID.
