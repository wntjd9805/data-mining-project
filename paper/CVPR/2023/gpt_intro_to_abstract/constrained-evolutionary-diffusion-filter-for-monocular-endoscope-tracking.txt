Camera tracking plays a crucial role in various computer vision applications, including augmented reality, 3-D reconstruction, and robotics. While there have been significant advancements in 3-D tracking, the focus of this paper is on tracking using endoscopic cameras. Unlike conventional cameras, endoscopic cameras are handheld devices used for inspecting hard-to-reach areas in tubular or hollow structures. Surgical endoscopes, in particular, are used for examining cavities in the body. However, these cameras only provide 2-D video images without depth information, limiting their ability to localize targets of interest. In order to address this limitation, surgical 3-D tracking methods have been developed to accurately localize surgical tools and reduce harm in endoscopic or robotic surgery. Stochastic filtering is a commonly used approach for 3-D tracking, but it has limitations in terms of exploring the search space and converging to the optimal solution. This paper proposes a new filtering strategy, called constrained evolutionary diffusion filtering (CEDF), to address the particle degeneracy-impoverishment problem and effectively balance exploration and exploitation. The paper also addresses challenges in current surgical 3-D tracking methods, including image uncertainty, inaccurate measurements, and tissue deformation. The contributions of this work include the introduction of new spatial state constraints for optimization problems and the development of a hybrid bronchoscope 3-D tracking framework that integrates data from multiple sources. Overall, this paper presents a new approach for 3-D tracking in surgical endoscopy that improves optimization performance and addresses current challenges in the field.
