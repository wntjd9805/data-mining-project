Image blurring in photographs can be caused by camera shake, object motion, and defocus. This can be formulated as a convolution process where the blurry image, y, is obtained by convolving the clear image, x, with the blur kernel, k, and adding Gaussian noise, n. Image deblurring techniques have been developed to restore the clear image from the blurry one. These techniques can be classified into two categories: blind deblurring methods, where the blur kernel is unknown and needs to be estimated, and non-blind deblurring methods, where the blur kernel is known or computed externally. Blind deblurring methods involve estimating the blur kernel and then recovering the clear image using the estimated kernel. Recently, transformer-based and unfolding networks have also been introduced for direct mapping from blurry image to deblurred image without using the kernel. Non-blind deblurring methods estimate the clear image solely from the blurry image with a known blur kernel. However, these methods often introduce artifacts and have poor performance when there is uncertainty in the kernel acquisition process. To address this, semi-blind methods have been proposed, which incorporate priors for the kernel error. These priors can be hand-crafted or data-driven. Hand-crafted priors perform well but struggle with complex distributions of the kernel error, while data-driven priors are sensitive to out-of-distribution blurs and images. In this paper, we introduce a dataset-free deep prior called deep residual prior (DRP) for the kernel-induced error. DRP leverages the representation ability of deep neural networks and combines it with sparse prior knowledge to form a semi-blind deblurring model. Our contributions include the design of the dataset-free DRP, the development of an unsupervised semi-blind deblurring model that combines deep and hand-crafted priors, and extensive experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially against kernel errors.
