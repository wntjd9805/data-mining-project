This paper introduces a method called Paprika, which aims to learn a novel video representation for procedure understanding tasks in instructional videos. The existing methods for video representation learning lack the ability to capture procedural knowledge, limiting their effectiveness for fine-grained procedure understanding tasks. Paprika addresses this limitation by leveraging a Procedural Knowledge Graph (PKG) that encodes structural information about tasks and steps. The PKG is constructed by combining text and step information from a procedural knowledge database and visual and step information from unlabeled instructional video datasets. Paprika is trained on multiple pre-training objectives using the PKG to obtain training labels. The proposed method is evaluated on COIN and CrossTask datasets, demonstrating superior performance in downstream procedure understanding tasks such as task recognition, step recognition, and step forecasting. The results show significant improvements in accuracy compared to the state of the art.
