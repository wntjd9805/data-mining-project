This paper introduces a novel framework for performing cross-guided optimization between radiance fields and single-image super-resolution (SISR) in the task of high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS). The goal is to improve the performance of HRNVS by incorporating high-frequency details from SISR and maintaining multi-view consistency in the synthesized images. The proposed framework involves train-view synthesis during the radiance fields optimization process, generating voxel-based uncertainty fields to identify reliable regions in the synthesized images, and using an SR update module for multi-view image super-resolution. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of HRNVS and multi-view super-resolution. The contributions of this paper include the proposed framework, voxel-based uncertainty fields, and the SR update module.
