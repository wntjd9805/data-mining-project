This paper introduces the concept of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and their use in generating photo-realistic images from new viewpoints. It highlights the success of NeRF and the numerous approaches proposed to improve its performance. One limitation of NeRF is the need for precise camera settings during training, which is difficult to achieve in practice. Additionally, NeRF's simplified scene representation may result in artifacts and poor generalization to unseen views. To address these limitations, various techniques have been proposed, such as joint optimization of camera parameters and radiance fields and the use of physical-aware models. However, there is a lack of research on removing NeRF-style degradations. The paper proposes the development of a practical NeRF-agnostic restorer to enhance synthesized views and presents a degradation simulator for NeRF-style artifacts. A dataset consisting of a variety of NeRF-style degradations is constructed, and existing image restoration frameworks are evaluated. The paper also introduces a degradation-driven inter-viewpoint mixer that aligns image contents and proposes a fast view selection technique to improve efficiency. The contributions of the paper include the development of a universal enhancer for NeRF models, a NeRF rendering degradation simulator, an inter-viewpoint mixer, and a training time acceleration technique. Overall, the paper aims to improve the quality and performance of NeRF rendering frames.
