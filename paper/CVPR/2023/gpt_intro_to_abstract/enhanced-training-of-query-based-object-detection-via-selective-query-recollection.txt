Object detection has been a well-studied area in computer vision, but existing methods rely on dense priors and hand-crafted processing steps. Recent research has focused on query-based object detection, which represents objects using learnable query embeddings. However, the decoding process in these methods often leads to mistakes in later stages, degrading true-positives and increasing false-positives. We propose a training strategy called Query Recollection (QR) that addresses these limitations by cumulatively collecting intermediate queries and feeding them to downstream stages. We also introduce Selective Query Recollection (SQR), which selectively forwards queries from prior stages to mitigate cascading errors. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SQR in improving the performance of query-based object detectors.
