Abstract:This paper proposes a novel method called attention-based point cloud edge sampling (APES) for selecting representative subsets of points from point clouds. The method combines neural network-based learning and mathematical statistics-based direct point selecting. Inspired by the success of detecting primary edges in 2D image processing, the APES method focuses on salient outline points (edge points) for sampling point cloud subsets. The method uses the attention mechanism to compute correlation maps and selects edge points based on their properties reflected in these maps. Two variants of APES are proposed: local-based APES, which uses neighbor-to-point attention, and global-based APES, which uses point-to-point attention. The proposed method directly selects sampled points and preserves their point index meaning for easy visualization. Additionally, the method can downsample the input point cloud to any desired size. Experimental results on common point cloud benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sampling method.
