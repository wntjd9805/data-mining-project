In this paper, we address the issue of poor visual quality in images caused by adverse weather conditions. These conditions, such as rain, haze, and snow, negatively affect the performance of outdoor vision systems. While various restoration methods have been proposed, they are often specific to certain weather scenarios and require multiple sets of parameters, leading to computational and storage burdens. We propose a unified deep model that learns both weather-general and weather-specific features to remove weather-related artifacts under multiple weather conditions. Our model is trained in two stages, first learning the general features and then expanding the specific parameters for each weather type. We also introduce a new real-world benchmark dataset with multiple weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.
