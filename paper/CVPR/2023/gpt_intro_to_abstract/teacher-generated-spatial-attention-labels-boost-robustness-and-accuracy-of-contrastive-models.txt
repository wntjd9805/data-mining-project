Deep learning models have made significant progress in various vision tasks, but they often fall short compared to humans. One reason is that deep learning models tend to learn "short-cuts" and give significance to physically meaningless patterns. Human vision, on the other hand, is more robust and generalizable, as humans tend to focus on specific regions in a visual scene. This raises the question of whether guiding machine vision models with human spatial attention could be beneficial.Previous research has shown that human spatial attention can benefit computer vision models in supervised tasks. However, it remains unclear if weak supervision in the form of human spatial attention can also benefit self-supervised models trained end-to-end. To test this hypothesis, a large volume of human spatial attention labels is required, which is an expensive and tedious process.In this paper, the authors propose a method to obtain spatial attention labels for large-scale image datasets using machine pseudo-labeling. They train a teacher model on limited ground truth human spatial attention labels and use this model to generate pseudo-labels for the ImageNet benchmark. These generated spatial attention maps are then utilized in contrastive models. The authors find that this approach leads to representations that are highly predictive of human spatial attention.Experimental results show that the learned representations outperform other methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, precision, and recall on various downstream tasks such as classification and image retrieval. Interestingly, the gains from using teacher models to provide pseudo labels are greater than using limited ground truth human labels directly, and the gains are even larger for contrastive models compared to supervised models.Overall, the contributions of this work include the creation of a dataset with spatial attention maps for the ImageNet benchmark, the use of spatial attention labels as an additional prediction target in contrastive models, and the demonstration of improved performance in downstream tasks. These findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating human spatial attention in machine vision models.
