Introducing Local Editing NeRF (LENeRF), a novel framework for 3D content editing that addresses the limitations of existing methods. Current tools for 3D editing often have complex interfaces, making them difficult for novice users and time-consuming for professionals. LENeRF focuses on important aspects such as photorealism, multi-view consistency, usability, diversity, and locality. One notable advantage of LENeRF is its text-only editing, which makes it more user-friendly and applicable to any domain. Additionally, LENeRF achieves real-time editing without the need for test-time optimization. This approach exhibits robust performance in local 3D editing by allowing independent manipulation of features in the 3D space. LENeRF comprises three modules: Latent Residual Mapper (LRM), Attention Field Network (AFN), and Deformation Network (DN). LRM generates a latent code for producing target feature fields, AFN generates 3D masks to indicate the region of interest, and DN distorts the source feature fields for synthesis. LENeRF is trained with CLIP guidance and additional training with CLIP-generated pseudo labels. The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of LENeRF as a localized, photo-realistic 3D editing framework with a text-based interface, the incorporation of a 3D distillation of CLIP knowledge for generating 3D masks, and diverse qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating the effectiveness of LENeRF in various editing applications.
