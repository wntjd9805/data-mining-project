This paper introduces a new formulation of visual reasoning for identifying scene dynamics by focusing on order-aware change recognition. The existing visual reasoning studies primarily focus on scenes in fixed periods of time, neglecting the temporal orders of changes. However, identifying temporal order is crucial in understanding how scene dynamics occur in time and has various practical applications. This study proposes the use of a visual transformation graph to represent change contents and their chronological orders. A dataset, named order-aware visual transformation (OVT), is created to evaluate the performance of existing methods in order-aware change recognition. The proposed method, visual transformation graph generator (VTGen), achieves state-of-the-art performance in the OVT dataset and outperforms existing methods. However, there is still a performance gap between the best-performing model and humans. The contributions of this paper include proposing the OVT task and dataset, evaluating existing methods, and introducing the VTGen method. The goal of this research is to contribute to achieving human-level visual reasoning in scene dynamics.
