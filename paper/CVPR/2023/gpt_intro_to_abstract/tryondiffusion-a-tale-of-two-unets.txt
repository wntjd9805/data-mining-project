Virtual apparel try-on is a technology that aims to visually simulate how a garment would look on a person using their image and an image of the garment. While this technology has the potential to greatly enhance the online shopping experience, most existing try-on methods only work effectively when there is minimal variation in body pose and shape. A major challenge in virtual try-on is how to warp a garment to fit a target body shape without distorting its patterns and texture. When there is significant variation in pose or body shape, the garment needs to be warped in a way that creates or flattens wrinkles according to the new shape or occlusions. This paper addresses the open problem of non-rigid garment warping in virtual try-on and proposes a solution to overcome these challenges.
