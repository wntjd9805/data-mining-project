Image registration is an important task in medical image analysis, as it helps estimate spatial correspondences between pairs of images. It has various applications, such as estimating organ motion in radiation therapy, capturing disease progression, and allowing for localized analyses in a common coordinate system. Over the years, numerous registration algorithms have been proposed in the field of medical imaging and computer vision, focusing on different transformation models, similarity measures, and solution strategies. While traditional methods rely on numerical optimization, recent approaches use neural networks to predict transformations based on large populations of image pairs. However, these learning-based methods still require parameter tuning, and the choice of network architecture remains an important consideration. In the field of medical image registration specifically, smooth and diffeomorphic transformations are desired. While optical flow estimation has seen significant improvements, a simple-to-use learning-based registration approach that can adapt to different data types is yet to be achieved. Nonparametric registration approaches require a balance between image similarity and regularization of transformations, making it challenging to find suitable regularizers. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the GradICON (Gradient Inverse CONsistency) regularizer, which penalizes the Jacobian of the inverse consistency condition. This approach improves convergence, eliminates the need for careful scheduling of the inverse consistency penalty, generates spatially regular transformation maps, and enhances registration accuracy. The proposed method is evaluated on three large medical datasets and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.
