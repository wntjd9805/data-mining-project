This paper introduces a novel method for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) that aims to learn semantic segmentation with weak labels. The existing literature in the field employs Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to localize the regions of each class, but CAMs often focus on discriminative regions and lack precision at the boundaries. In this paper, the authors propose a new approach inspired by the idea that perfect semantic segmentation results in mutually independent segments that cannot infer information about each other. They formulate the problem as an adversarial learning of a classifier and a reconstructor, where the reconstructor reconstructs one image segment from the other segments. The quality of reconstruction serves as a measure of inferability. The authors train the classifier to generate CAMs that reduce inferability and improve the precision of segmentation. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets. The contribution of this paper includes formulating the problem of WSSS as minimizing inferability, proposing a novel WSSS framework based on adversarial learning, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
