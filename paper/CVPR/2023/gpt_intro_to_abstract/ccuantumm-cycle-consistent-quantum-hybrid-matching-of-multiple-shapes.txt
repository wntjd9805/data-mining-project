The introduction of the paper discusses the growing interest in using quantum computers for computer vision applications. Specifically, the paper focuses on quantum annealing (QA) methods that solve NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBOs). While formulating a problem as a QUBO has limitations, QA is expected to solve QUBOs at faster speeds compared to classical hardware. The paper highlights the problem of shape matching and the challenges of matching multiple shapes. Previous quantum-hybrid methods like Q-Match have shown promise in pairwise shape matching, but the question remains on how to design a multi-shape matching algorithm with similar benefits. The computational complexity of pairwise matching increases quadratically with the number of shapes, making it unsuitable for large N. The paper introduces CCuantuMM, a new method that outperforms similar variants and is competitive with classical shape methods. The experiments demonstrate the potential of quantum hardware in computer vision.
