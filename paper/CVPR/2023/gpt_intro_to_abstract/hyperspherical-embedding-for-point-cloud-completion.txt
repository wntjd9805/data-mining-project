The continual improvement of 3D sensors has led to an increased accessibility of point clouds, resulting in the development of algorithms for their analysis. Deep learning techniques have greatly enhanced the performance of point cloud analysis algorithms by effectively learning representations from large 3D datasets. These algorithms have found numerous applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and 3D modeling. However, real-world point clouds are often incomplete and sparse due to various factors such as occlusions, low resolution, and limited sensor views. Therefore, it is crucial to have an algorithm capable of predicting complete shapes of objects from partial observations.Various methods have been proposed to address the challenge of point cloud completion, with most existing methods utilizing encoder-decoder structures. These methods involve the encoder taking a partial point cloud as input and generating an embedding vector, which is then used by the decoder to predict a complete point cloud. The high-dimensional embedding space is designed to have sufficient capacity to contain all necessary information for downstream tasks. However, it has been observed that the learned high-dimensional embeddings tend to have a sparse distribution, leading to poor generalizability of models as unseen features in testing may not be captured by the learned representation.Real-world applications often require predictions from multiple different tasks. Instead of training each task individually, a more efficient approach is to train all relevant tasks jointly by sharing networks between them. However, existing point cloud completion methods lack the analysis of integrating point cloud completion with other tasks. It has been shown that training existing point cloud completion methods with other semantic tasks leads to inferior performance compared to individual training.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hyperspherical module that outputs hyperspherical embeddings for point cloud completion. The module can be integrated into existing encoder-decoder structures. It transforms and constrains the output embedding onto the surface of a hypersphere by normalizing the embedding's magnitude to unit, thereby preserving only directional information for later use. The effects of hyperspherical embeddings are theoretically investigated, demonstrating improved performance in point cloud completion models through more stable training and learning of compact embedding distributions. The proposed hyperspherical embedding also helps reconcile the learning conflicts between point cloud completion and other semantic tasks in multi-task learning. Experimental results on public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper's main contributions include the introduction of the hyperspherical module, theoretical analysis of hyperspherical embeddings, and the exploration of training point cloud completion with other tasks and reconciliation of conflicts through the hyperspherical embedding.
