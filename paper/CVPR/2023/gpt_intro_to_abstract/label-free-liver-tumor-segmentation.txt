Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized medical image segmentation, but training AI models often requires a large number of annotations, which is costly and time-consuming. To address this issue, researchers have started generating synthetic tumors as a cost-effective alternative. However, existing methods struggle to create realistic synthetic tumors that resemble real tumors, leading to poor performance of AI models trained on synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to synthesize realistic liver tumors in abdominal CT scans. Our approach incorporates clinical knowledge to generate tumors with accurate location, texture, and shape. Medical professionals have difficulty distinguishing our synthetic tumors from real tumors. Moreover, AI models trained on our synthetic tumors achieve similar segmentation performance as those trained on real tumors. This breakthrough suggests that synthetic tumors have the potential to replace real tumors in training AI models for tumor segmentation tasks. Our strategy offers several advantages, including the ability to generate tumors with desired characteristics, eliminate the need for manual annotation in the training stage, and improve the performance of AI models compared to existing methods. This work could lead to a paradigm shift in tumor segmentation training, moving towards label-free AI development. Our ultimate goal is to train AI models for tumor segmentation without any manual annotation, and this study represents a significant step towards that goal. Additionally, our strategy can be extended to CT scans with healthy livers and data from different hospitals, providing a comprehensive test-bed for evaluating AI models. Overall, our synthesis strategy has the potential to facilitate the early detection of liver cancer and enable the detection of small tumors.
