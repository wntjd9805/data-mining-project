Abstract
Classifying incomplete multi-view data is inevitable since arbitrary view missing widely exists in real-world applica-tions. Although great progress has been achieved, existing incomplete multi-view methods are still difficult to obtain a trustworthy prediction due to the relatively high uncertainty nature of missing views. First, the missing view is of high uncertainty, and thus it is not reasonable to provide a single deterministic imputation. Second, the quality of the imputed data itself is of high uncertainty. To explore and exploit the uncertainty, we propose an Uncertainty-induced Incomplete
Multi-View Data Classification (UIMC) model to classify the incomplete multi-view data under a stable and reliable framework. We construct a distribution and sample multiple times to characterize the uncertainty of missing views, and adaptively utilize them according to the sampling quality.
Accordingly, the proposed method realizes more perceivable imputation and controllable fusion. Specifically, we model each missing data with a distribution conditioning on the available views and thus introducing uncertainty. Then an evidence-based fusion strategy is employed to guarantee the trustworthy integration of the imputed views. Extensive ex-periments are conducted on multiple benchmark data sets and our method establishes a state-of-the-art performance in terms of both performance and trustworthiness. 1.

Introduction
Learning from multiple complementary views has the potential to yield more generalizable models. Benefiting from the power of deep learning, multi-view learning has further exhibited remarkable benefits against the single-view paradigm in clustering [1–3], classification [4, 5] and rep-resentation learning [6, 7]. However, real-world data are usually incomplete. For instance, in the medical field, pa-tients with same condition may choose different medical examinations producing incomplete/unaligned multi-view

For the task of incomplete multi-view classification (IMVC), there have been plenty of studies which could be roughly categorized into two main lines. The methods [8, 9] only use available views without imputation to conduct clas-sification. While the other line [10–13] reconstructs miss-ing data based on deep learning methods such as autoen-coder [14, 15] or generative adversarial network (GAN) [16], and then utilizes the imputed complete data for classification.
Although significant progress has been achieved by exist-ing IMVC methods, there are still limitations: (1) Methods that simply neglect missing views are usually ineffective especially under high missing rate due to the limitation in exploring the correlation among views; (2) Methods that impute missing data based on deep learning methods are short in interpretability and the deterministic imputation way fails to characterize the uncertainty of missing resulting in unstable classification; (3) Few IMVC methods can handle multi-view data with complex missing patterns especially for the data with more than two views, which makes these methods inflexible.
In view of above limitations, we propose a simple yet effective, stable and flexible incomplete multi-view classi-fication model. First, the proposed model characterizes the uncertainty of each missing view by imputing a distribution instead of a deterministic value. The necessity of charac-terizing the uncertainty for missing data on single view has been well recognized in recent works [17, 18]. Second, we conduct sampling multiple times from the above distribution and each one is combined with the observed views to form multiple completed multi-view samples. The quality of the sampled data is of high uncertainty, and thus we adaptively integrate them according to their quality on the single view and multi-view fusion. For single view, the uncertainty of the low-quality sampled data tends to be large and should not affect the learning of other views. Therefore, we con-struct an evidence-based classifier for each view to obtain the
opinion including subjective probabilities and uncertainty masses. While for multi-view fusion, the opinions from mul-tiple views are integrated based on DS rule, which ensures the trustworthy utilization of arbitrary-quality views. The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
• We propose an exploration-and-exploitation strategy for classifying incomplete multi-view data by characteriz-ing the uncertainty of missing data, which promotes both effectiveness and trustworthiness in utilizing im-puted data. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
UIMC is the first work asserting uncertainty in incom-plete multi-view classification.
• To fully exploit the high-quality imputed data and re-duce the affect of the low-quality imputed views, we propose to weight the imputed data from two aspects, avoiding the negative effect on single view and multi-view fusion. The uncertainty-aware training and fusion significantly ensure the effectiveness and reliability of integrating uncertain imputed data.
• We conduct experiments on classification for data with multiple types of features or modalities, and evaluate the results with diverse metrics, which validates that the proposed UIMC outperforms existing methods in the above tasks and is trustworthy with reliable uncertainty. 2.
