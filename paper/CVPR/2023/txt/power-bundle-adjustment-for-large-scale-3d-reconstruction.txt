Abstract
We introduce Power Bundle Adjustment as an expansion type algorithm for solving large-scale bundle adjustment problems. It is based on the power series expansion of the inverse Schur complement and constitutes a new family of solvers that we call inverse expansion methods. We theo-retically justify the use of power series and we prove the convergence of our approach. Using the real-world BAL dataset we show that the proposed solver challenges the state-of-the-art iterative methods and significantly acceler-ates the solution of the normal equation, even for reaching a very high accuracy. This easy-to-implement solver can also complement a recently presented distributed bundle adjust-ment framework. We demonstrate that employing the pro-posed Power Bundle Adjustment as a sub-problem solver significantly improves speed and accuracy of the distributed optimization. 1.

Introduction
Bundle adjustment (BA) is a classical computer vision problem that forms the core component of many 3D recon-struction and Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms. It refers to the joint estimation of camera parameters and 3D landmark positions by minimization of a non-linear repro-jection error. The recent emergence of large-scale internet photo collections [1] raises the need for BA methods that are scalable with respect to both runtime and memory. And building accurate city-scale maps for applications such as augmented reality or autonomous driving brings current BA approaches to their limits.
As the solution of the normal equation is the most time consuming step of BA, the Schur complement trick is usu-ally employed to form the reduced camera system (RCS).
This linear system involves only the pose parameters and is significantly smaller. Its size can be reduced even more by using a QR factorization, deriving only a matrix square root of the RCS, and then solving an algebraically equivalent 1Technical University of Munich 2Munich Center for Machine Learning 3University of Oxford (a) Ladybug-1197 (b) Venice-1102

√ problem [4]. Both the RCS and its square root formulation are commonly solved by iterative methods such as the pop-ular preconditioned conjugate gradients algorithm for large-scale problems or by direct methods such as Cholesky fac-torization for small-scale problems.
In the following, we will challenge these two families of solvers by relying on an iterative approximation of the inverse Schur complement. In particular, our contributions
are as follows:
• We introduce Power Bundle Adjustment (PoBA) for ef-ficient large-scale BA. This new family of techniques that we call inverse expansion methods challenges the state-of-the-art methods which are built on iterative and direct solvers.
• We link the bundle adjustment problem to the theory of power series and we provide theoretical proofs that justify this expansion and establish the convergence of our solver.
• We perform extensive evaluation of the proposed ap-proach on the BAL dataset and compare to several state-of-the-art solvers. We highlight the benefits of PoBA in terms of speed, accuracy, and memory-consumption. Figure 1 shows reconstructions for two out of the 97 evaluated BAL problems.
• We incorporate our solver into a recently proposed distributed BA framework and show a significant im-provement in terms of speed and accuracy.
• We release our solver as open source to facili-tate further research: https://github.com/ simonwebertum/poba 2.
