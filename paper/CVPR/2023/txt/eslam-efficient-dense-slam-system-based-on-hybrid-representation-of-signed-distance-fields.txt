Abstract
We present ESLAM, an efficient implicit neural represen-tation method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). ESLAM reads RGB-D frames with unknown cam-era poses in a sequential manner and incrementally recon-structs the scene representation while estimating the cur-rent camera position in the scene. We incorporate the latest advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into a SLAM system, resulting in an efficient and accurate dense visual
SLAM method. Our scene representation consists of multi-scale axis-aligned perpendicular feature planes and shal-low decoders that, for each point in the continuous space, decode the interpolated features into Truncated Signed Dis-tance Field (TSDF) and RGB values. Our extensive exper-iments on three standard datasets, Replica, ScanNet, and
TUM RGB-D show that ESLAM improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and camera localization of state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM methods by more than 50%, while it runs up to ×10 faster and does not require any pre-training.

Introduction
Dense visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a fundamental challenge in 3D computer vi-sion with several applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual/augmented reality. It is defined as con-structing a 3D map of an unknown environment while si-multaneously approximating the camera pose.
While traditional SLAM systems [16, 41, 45, 55, 76, 77] mostly focus on localization accuracy, recent learning-based dense visual SLAM methods [2, 11, 25, 35, 60, 64, 65, 67, 81, 86] provide meaningful global 3D maps and show reasonable but limited reconstruction accuracy.
Following the advent of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [37] and the demonstration of their capacity to rea-son about the geometry of a large-scale scene [8, 13, 20, 22, 26, 75, 78] and reconstruct 3D surfaces [1, 29, 47, 48, 62, 71, 72, 82, 85], novel NeRF-based dense SLAM methods have been developed. In particular, iMAP [59] and NICE-SLAM [87] utilize neural implicit networks to achieve a consistent geometry representation.
IMAP [59] represents the geometry with a single huge
MLP, similar to NeRF [37], and optimizes the camera poses during the rendering process. NICE-SLAM [87] im-proves iMAP by storing the representation locally on voxel grids to prevent the forgetting problem. Despite promis-ing reconstruction quality, these methods are computation-ally demanding for real-time applications, and their ability to capture geometry details is limited. In addition, NICE-SLAM [87] uses frozen pre-trained MLPs, which limits its generalizability to novel scenes. We take NICE-SLAM [87] as a baseline and provide the following contributions:
• We leverage implicit Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) [1] to represent geometry, which converges noticeably faster than the common rendering-based representations like volume density [59] or occu-pancy [87] and results in higher quality reconstruction.
• Instead of storing features on voxel grids, we propose employing multi-scale axis-aligned feature planes [6]
which leads to reducing the memory footprint growth rate w.r.t. scene side-length from cubic to quadratic.
• We benchmark our method on three challenging datasets, Replica [57], ScanNet [12], and TUM RGB-D [58], to demonstrate the performance of our method in comparison to existing ones and provide an exten-sive ablation study to validate our design choices.
Thanks to the inherent smoothness of representing the scene with feature planes, our method produces higher-quality smooth surfaces without employing explicit smoothness loss functions like [70].
Concurrent with our work, the followings also propose
Radiance Fields-based SLAM systems: iDF-SLAM [38] also uses TSDF, but it is substantially slower and less ac-curate than NICE-SLAM [87]. Orbeez-SLAM [10] op-erates in real-time at the cost of poor 3D reconstruction.
Compromising accuracy and quality, MeSLAM [27] intro-duces a memory-efficient SLAM. MonoNeuralFusion [88] proposes an incremental 3D reconstruction model, assum-ing that ground truth camera postures are available. Lastly,
NeRF-SLAM [54] presents a monocular SLAM system with hierarchical volumetric Neural Radiance Fields opti-mized using an uncertainty-based depth loss. 2.
