Abstract
The archaeological dating of bronze dings has played a critical role in the study of ancient Chinese history. Current archaeology depends on trained experts to carry out bronze dating, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. For such dating, in this study, we propose a learning-based ap-proach to integrate advanced deep learning techniques and archaeological knowledge. To achieve this, we first collect a large-scale image dataset of bronze dings, which contains richer attribute information than other existing fine-grained datasets. Second, we introduce a multihead classifier and a knowledge-guided relation graph to mine the relationship between attributes and the ding era. Third, we conduct comparison experiments with various existing methods, the results of which show that our dating method achieves a state-of-the-art performance. We hope that our data and applied networks will enrich fine-grained classification re-search relevant to other interdisciplinary areas of expertise.
The dataset and source code used are included in our sup-plementary materials, and will be open after submission owing to the anonymity policy. Source codes and data are available at: https://github.com/zhourixin/bronze-Ding 1.

Introduction
Dings are cauldrons used for cooking, storage, and rit-ual offerings to gods or ancestors in ancient China, and they are the most important species used in Chinese ritual bronzes [35]. The archaeological dating of dings has con-tributed to the study of ancient Chinese history. Although the excavated bronzes are massive, dating such artifacts de-pends on the long-term training and accumulation of ex-pertise in archaeological typology [58]. In addition, some

artifacts are easy to identify to a precise age and others are difficult to identify.
For the object, we focus on a ding, the features of which are similar and complicated in different eras, as shown in the columns of Figure 1. We therefore consider this dat-ing task as a fine-grained classification problem. Simulta-neously, research into fine-grained classification is close to that of other areas of expertise because it often requires ex-pensive specialized data and knowledge areas, such as birds (zoology) [51, 52] and flowers (botany) [43].
Data features and domain knowledge, particularly in ar-chaeology, vary in different fields. In addition to the com-mon traits of the existing fine-grained datasets, our data are more challenging. First, our data are unbalanced and dif-ficult to mitigate through their collection because they are determined based on an unearthed state. Second, there are more similarities between bronze dings of adjacent eras, leading to the possibility of misclassifying them into fine granularity adjacent eras beyond a coarse granularity.
In other words, compared to other fine-grained classification data, our data have a larger intra-class difference and a smaller inter-class difference between adjacent eras. Third, the attributes and eras are intertwined and the relations are more complex. Each period of bronze dings has multiple shapes and characteristics, and each shape and characteris-tic correspond to multiple periods of bronze dings, leading to the impracticality of making simple judgments regarding the period based on the shape and characteristic. Existing fine-grained classification methods therefore struggle when applying our data.
To address these issues, we make the following contribu-tions in this study:
• We collect an image dataset of 3690 bronze dings with rich annotations made by bronze experts, including the era (4 course-grained dynasties and 11 fine-grained periods), attributes (29 shapes and 96 characteristics with bounding boxes), literature, location of excava-tion, and the museum where they are displayed.
• We build an end-to-end multihead network to solve this multi-granularity task. The two heads combine coarse- and fine-grained features in a bidirectional manner with a gradient truncated addition to improve the performance at both granularities. The outputs of other two heads, the shape and characteristic nodes, are added to a knowledge-guided relation graph to embed the domain knowledge into our network,
• We propose exploiting these rich attributes following archaeological knowledge by employing the focal-type probability classification loss and indicate the ineffec-tiveness of simply concatenating external information.
• We achieve the best performance in terms of the dating accuracy, outperforming other state-of-the-art (SOTA) fine-grained classification methods. 2.
