Abstract
Test-time adaptation methods have been gaining atten-tion recently as a practical solution for addressing source-to-target domain gaps by gradually updating the model without requiring labels on the target data. In this paper, we propose a method of test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation called TTA-COPE. We design a pose ensemble approach with a self-training loss using pose-aware confidence. Unlike previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods for category-level object pose estima-tion, our approach processes the test data in a sequential, online manner, and it does not require access to the source domain at runtime. Extensive experimental results demon-strate that the proposed pose ensemble and the self-training loss improve category-level object pose performance dur-ing test time under both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. 1.

Introduction
Object pose estimation is a crucial problem in com-puter vision and robotics. Advanced methods that fo-cus on diverse variations of object 6D pose estimation have been introduced, such as known 3D objects (instance-level) [28, 38], category-level [18, 36, 43], few-shot [52], and zero-shot pose estimation [13, 47]. These techniques are useful for downstream applications requiring an on-line operation, such as robotic manipulation [6, 25, 48] and augmented reality [23, 24, 32]. Our paper focuses on the category-level object pose estimation problem since it is more broadly applicable than the instance-level problem.
Many works on category-level object pose estimation [2, 3, 17, 18, 36, 43, 44] have been proposed recently. These approaches estimate multiple classes of object pose more efficiently in a single network compared to the instance-level object pose estimation methods [27, 38, 41, 49–51], which depend on known 3D shape knowledge and the size of the objects. Notably, Wang et al. [43] introduced a novel representation called Normalized Object Coordinate
Space (NOCS) to align various object instances within each
Figure 1. We propose a Test-Time Adaptation for Category-level
Object Pose Estimation framework (TTA-COPE) that automati-cally improves the network in an online manner without labeled target data. As new image frames are processed, our method fine-tunes the network using the unlabeled data and simultaneously ap-plies the network to perform pose estimation via inference. This approach successfully handles domain shifts compared with no adaptation, as seen here. category in a canonical 3D space. The strengths of the
NOCS representation have led to its adoption by follow-up work [3, 17, 36].
In order to obtain accurate category-level object pose methods in unseen real-world scenarios, it is desirable to fine-tune the models in the new environment with labeled target data. The model that is not fine-tuned on the tar-get domain distribution will almost certainly exhibit lower performance than the fine-tuned model [37]. However, an-notating 6D poses of objects in the target environment is an expensive process [1, 39, 43, 45] that we seek to avoid.
Table 1. Comparison with prior unsupervised works for category-level object pose estimation. Our unsupervised method trains models without 2D or 3D labels of target data, similar to
Self-DPDN [16]. Unlike previous methods, our proposed ap-proach updates the model online without offline batch processing.
Moreover, we do not use the source data during test time (source-free) because it is impractical to train on a large amount of source data every iteration. There also may be privacy or legal constraints to access source data [21].

Compared to annotating in 2D space, labeling in 3D space requires specific knowledge about geometry [7] from the annotator and is much more laborious, time-consuming, and error-prone due to the complex nature of SE(3) space.
Therefore, it is usually challenging to annotate real-world data with 3D annotations for fine-tuning.
In order to solve the aforementioned problem of anno-tating object pose data in the real world, several recent methods [5, 15, 16] propose unsupervised domain adapta-tion (UDA) that aims to train the network without utilizing the ground truth of target pose labels. Although they show promising results using UDA techniques, these approaches still do not meet some of the requirements for online ap-plications. For example, when a robot encounters a new environment, it is desirable to adapt the scene online man-ner while estimating object poses rather than waiting for enough data to be collected in the novel scene to train the model offline.
This problem definition of online fine-tuning is more practical for real applications, where we desire to update the model instantly when new data becomes available for fast domain adaptation. This setting is known as test-time adaptation (TTA) [42]. For TTA, the requirements are as follows: 1) labeled source data should not be accessed at test time, 2) adaptation should be online (rather than of-fline batch processing), and 3) the method should be fully unsupervised, without using 2D or 3D target labels during online fine-tuning. Since we do not have access to labeled source data (source-free) at test time this problem is more challenging than existing unsupervised category-level ob-ject pose methods [5,15,16,29]. Table 1 summarizes the dif-ference between our problem definition and existing meth-ods, showing that test-time adaptation for category-level ob-ject pose estimation remains an open problem.
In this paper, we propose Test-time Adaptation for
Category-level Object Pose Estimation (TTA-COPE) to handle domain shifts without any target domain annota-tions (see Fig. 1). Prior works on general test-time adapta-tion [42, 46] propose self-training to minimize entropy loss.
TENT [42] has shown improvement in 2D classification and segmentation tasks. We show, however, that simply extend-ing TENT for the category-level object pose estimation is not effective. Another self-training strategy is the teacher-student framework [35] with pseudo labels. However, since pseudo labels are created without any noise filtering, naive pseudo labels may be unreliable and cause convergence to a suboptimal model.
To tackle this problem, we design a novel pose ensemble method to perform test-time adaptation for category-level object pose estimation by extending the pose-aware filter-ing of UDA-COPE [15]. The proposed method uses an en-semble of teacher-student predictions based on pose-aware confidence, which is used both for generating pseudo labels and inference. Also, the pose ensemble helps to train mod-els with additional self-training loss to reduce the domain shift for category-level pose estimation by using pose-aware confidence. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed pose ensemble and self-training loss with extensive stud-ies in both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. We show that our TTA-COPE framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to strong TTA baselines.
In summary, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
• We propose Test-Time Adaptation for Category-level
Object Pose Estimation (TTA-COPE), which handles domain shifts without labeling target data and without accessing source data during test time.
• We introduce a pose ensemble with self-training loss that utilizes the teacher-student predictions to generate robust pseudo labels and estimates accurate poses for inference.
• We evaluate our framework with experimental com-parisons against strong test-time baselines and state-of-the-art methods under both semi-supervised and un-supervised settings. 2.
