Abstract
Utilizing infrastructure and vehicle-side information to track and forecast the behaviors of surrounding traf-fic participants can significantly improve decision-making and safety in autonomous driving. However, the lack of real-world sequential datasets limits research in this area. To address this issue, we introduce V2X-Seq, the first large-scale sequential V2X dataset, which includes data frames, trajectories, vector maps, and traffic lights captured from natural scenery. V2X-Seq comprises two parts: the sequential perception dataset, which includes more than 15,000 frames captured from 95 scenarios, and the trajectory forecasting dataset, which contains about 80,000 infrastructure-view scenarios, 80,000 vehicle-view scenarios, and 50,000 cooperative-view scenarios cap-tured from 28 intersections’ areas, covering 672 hours of data. Based on V2X-Seq, we introduce three new tasks for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative (VIC) autonomous driv-ing: VIC3D Tracking, Online-VIC Forecasting, and Offline-VIC Forecasting. We also provide benchmarks for the intro-duced tasks. Find data, code, and more up-to-date informa-tion at https://github.com/AIR-THU/DAIR-V2X-Seq. 1.

Introduction
Although single-vehicle autonomous driving has made significant advancements in recent years, it still faces sig-nificant safety challenges due to its limited perceptual field and inability to accurately forecast the behaviors of traffic participants. These challenges hinder autonomous vehicles from making well-informed decisions and driving safer. A promising solution to address these challenges is to leverage infrastructure information via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)

The abscissa represents the number of sequences. communication, which has been shown to significantly ex-pand perception range and enhance autonomous driving safety [1, 38]. However, current research primarily focuses on utilizing infrastructure data to improve the perception ability of autonomous driving, particularly in the context of frame-by-frame 3D detection. To enable well-informed decision-making for autonomous vehicles, it is critical to also incorporate infrastructure data to track and predict the behavior of surrounding traffic participants.
To accelerate the research on cooperative sequential per-ception and forecasting, we release a large-scale sequential
V2X dataset, V2X-Seq. All elements of this dataset were captured and generated from real-world scenarios. Com-pared with DAIR-V2X [38], which focuses on 3D object detection tasks, V2X-Seq is specifically designed for track-ing and trajectory forecasting tasks. The V2X-Seq dataset is divided into two parts: the sequential perception dataset

V2X view includes multi-vehicle cooperative view and vehicle-infrastructure cooperative view. V2X-Seq is the first large-scale sequential V2X dataset and focuses on vehicle-infrastructure cooperative view. All data elements, including the traffic light signals, are captured and generated from the real world.

The sequential per-ception dataset comprises 15,000 frames captured from 95 scenarios, which include infrastructure images, infrastruc-ture point clouds, vehicle-side images, vehicle-side point clouds, 3D detection/tracking annotations, and vector maps.
The trajectory forecasting dataset comprises 210,000 sce-narios, including 50,000 cooperative-view scenarios, that were mined from 672 hours of data collected from 28 in-tersection areas. To our knowledge, V2X-Seq is the first sequential V2X dataset that includes such a large-scale sce-narios, making it an ideal resource for developing and test-ing cooperative perception and forecasting algorithms.
Based on the V2X-Seq dataset, we introduce three novel tasks for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative perception and forecasting. The first task is VIC3D Tracking, which aims to cooperatively locate, identify, and track 3D objects us-ing sequential sensor inputs from both the vehicle and in-frastructure. The second task is Online-VIC trajectory fore-casting, which focuses on accurately predicting future be-havior of target agents by utilizing past infrastructure tra-jectories, ego-vehicle trajectories, real-time traffic lights, and vector maps. The third task is Offline-VIC trajectory forecasting, which involves extracting relevant knowledge from previously collected infrastructure data to facilitate vehicle-side forecasting. These proposed tasks are accom-panied by rich benchmarks. Additionally, we propose an intermediate-level framework, FF-Tracking, to effectively solve the VIC3D Tracking task.
The main contributions are organized as follows:
• We release the V2X-Seq dataset, which constitutes the first large-scale sequential V2X dataset. All data are cap-tured and generated from the real world.
• Based on the V2X-Seq dataset, we introduce three tasks for the vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving community. To enable a fair evaluation of these tasks, we have carefully designed a set of benchmarks.
• We propose a middle fusion method, named FF-Tracking, for solving VIC3D Tracking and our proposed method can efficiently overcome the latency challenge. 2.
