Introduction
Reflection is a fundamental physical phenomenon of light that serves as a key creator of our rich visual world.
Models of light reflection lie at the heart of visual infor-mation processing both for synthesis and analysis. In com-puter vision, reflectance models play an essential role in 3D reconstruction, inverse rendering, and material estimation.
The goal is to invert light reflection to deduce its physical in-gredients, such as the surface geometry, from images. Nat-urally, devising simple yet accurate models that are faithful to the underlying physics becomes vital. Analytical mod-els provide a sound basis for solving these inverse problems as parameter estimation and physically-based models lend semantic interpretations of the results.
Physically-based analytical reflectance models have been studied extensively. Parametric representations of the
Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are of particular importance, as they enable pixel-wise esti-mation of its parameters. Most models widely adopted in computer vision are built on two representative mod-els corresponding to the two distinct reflection components, namely body reflection and surface reflection. Body reflec-tion refers to the light that transmits into the subsurface and is eventually emitted from the surface. It is also called dif-fuse reflection as it is comparatively scattered in directions.
The Lambertian reflectance model [17] which models it as uniform distribution in the angular domain dominates com-puter vision applications due to its simple linear form.
Surface reflection is the light that immediately reflects off the surface. It is also referred to as specular reflection as it primarily concentrates around the perfect mirror reflec-tion direction of incident light. Torrance and Sparrow [29] introduced the idea of modeling the microgeometry within a single pixel that causes this angular spread of surface reflec-tion with oriented mirror microfacets. Then on, many mod-els have built on this key idea of oriented microfacets [5,30].
Oren and Nayar [22] applied the idea to body reflection by assuming Lambertian instead of mirror microfacets.
A linear combination of these diffuse and specular re-flection models, most often Lambertian or Oren-Nayar plus
Torrance-Sparrow, have been widely used in vision appli-cations. There are, however, three problems that funda-mentally limit the accuracy of such a reflection represen-tation. The first is that the two reflection components are modeled on inconsistent microgeometry. Lambertian and other body reflection models assume a single Lambertian microfacet or an oriented distribution of Lambertian micro-facets [22], while specular reflection models assume mirror microfacets [29]. This is physically implausible and also hinders physical interpretation of the parameter estimates.
The second is that past diffuse reflection models do not account for light transport inside the microgeometry. The
Oren-Nayar model ignores discrepancies in incident and exitant microfacets. This can be fine for mesoscopic and macroscopic geometry (i.e., Bidirectional Texture Func-tion) as demonstrated in their work [22], but leads to signif-icant inaccuracy for microgeometry (i.e., regular imaging conditions). Incident light to one microfacet will likely exit from a different microfacet whose effect cannot be ignored for accurate body reflection representation.
The third is that estimation of the parameter values (i.e., reflectometry) of such linear combinations of diffuse and specular reflection models is inherently unstable. Specular reflection is usually either sparse (e.g., a shiny surface with a narrow highlight) or weak (e.g., a rough surface with a broad specular lobe). This makes estimation of specular parameter values while disentangling diffuse and specular components challenging. Most works thus require multiple images captured from different imaging conditions.
In this paper, we derive a novel analytical reflectance model that is physically accurate and generalizes to vari-ous real-world surfaces. Our key idea is to build up from the very atomic behavior of light reflection, namely Fresnel reflection. We model surface microgeometry with a col-lection of oriented mirror facets, both for body and surface reflections. We carefully derive the Fresnel reflection and transmission for each microfacet as well as the light trans-port between them in the subsurface. By modeling the full
Fresnel behavior of light for an analytically oriented distri-bution of mirror microfacets, we arrive at a generalized re-flection model that subsumes past representative models as special cases. This physically-grounded modeling allows us to describe the polarimetric behavior of reflected light by a rough surface, in addition to its radiometric behavior.
As a result, our novel reflectance model, which we refer to as Fresnel Microfacet BRDF model (FMBRDF), unifies not only body and surface reflections but also light reflection in

Table 1. Our Fresnel Microfacet BRDF model is, to our knowl-edge, the first physically-based reflection model that accurately expresses microfacet surface reflection (MSR), microfacet body reflection (MBR), Fresnel transmission (FT), microscopic light transport (MLT), and polarization (Pol.) in a single model. radiometry and polarization in a single model.
We experimentally validate our FMBRDF model by evaluating its accuracy with a wide range of measured
BRDFs and images of real surfaces. The results show that
FMBRDF can accurately model both the intensity and po-larization, particularly in comparison with past representa-tive models. We also show that FMBRDF can be estimated from a single polarimetric image. In the supplemental ma-terial, we demonstrate the use of FMBRDF for joint esti-mation of reflectance and geometry from multiple images taken under different light source directions.
To the best of our knowledge, FMBRDF is the first re-flectance model to seamlessly unify body and surface reflec-tions with the same microgeometry and also describe both its radiometric and polarimetric light reflections in a single model. We believe FMBRDF will provide an invaluable ba-sis for accurate radiometric and polarimetric image analysis and serve as a backbone for a wide range of computer vision applications.
