Abstract
Although deep neural networks have achieved astonish-ing performance in many vision tasks, existing learning-based methods are far inferior to the physical model-based solutions in extreme low-light sensor noise modeling. To tap the potential of learning-based sensor noise modeling, we investigate the noise formation in a typical imaging process and propose a novel physics-guided ISO-dependent sensor noise modeling approach. Specifically, we build a normal-izing flow-based framework to represent the complex noise characteristics of CMOS camera sensors. Each compo-nent of the noise model is dedicated to a particular kind of noise under the guidance of physical models. Moreover, we take into consideration of the ISO dependence in the noise model, which is not completely considered by the ex-isting learning-based methods. For training the proposed noise model, a new dataset is further collected with paired noisy-clean images, as well as flat-field and bias frames covering a wide range of ISO settings. Compared to exist-ing methods, the proposed noise model is equipped with a flexible structure and accurate modeling capabilities, which is beneficial for better denoising performance in extreme low-light scenes. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/happycaoyue/LLD. 1.

Introduction
In recent years, learning-based image denoising methods have achieved tremendous success with pairwise training samples [22, 32]. However, it is still challenging to recover high-quality results in extreme low-light scenarios, mainly due to limited data [9, 31]. Considering the difficulty of collecting enormous pairwise training data, noise model-ing [25, 31, 33] becomes an alternative solution by simu-lating noises that match the extreme low-light distribution.
The noises in extreme low-light scenarios contain severe striping artifacts and color bias, and the damage to image quality is inconsistent across different ISO settings and lo-cations. To model such complicated noises, physics-based methods [9, 29, 31, 33] build cumbersome statistical mod-els according to the physical process from photons (i.e., the light) to digital signals (i.e., the rawRGB image). Neverthe-less, the noise parameter calibration relies on a large num-ber of flat-field and bias frames, which is also laborious and expensive. For example, PMN [9] requires 400 bias frames at each ISO setting to calibrate the noise parameters.
For circumventing the tedious parameter calibration pro-cess, learning-based methods [1, 5, 25] directly learn the mapping from clean images to their noisy counterparts. Yet the performance is still far inferior to the physics-based statistical methods [31, 33]. To boost the performance of learning-based sensor noise modeling, we delve into such inferiority and attribute the major cause to the inconsistency between the noise models and the imaging process. For example, NoiseFlow [1] utilizes the distribution matching ability of normalizing flow but is unable to model strip-ing artifacts and color bias. Starlight [25] leverages vari-ous noise sources like heteroscedastic Gaussian noise, row noise, and fixed-pattern noise. However, it mixes the noises with the clean image and delivers them into a GAN model.
In other words, the noises are entangled with each other, which increases the difficulty of describing the noise distri-butions. Moreover, these methods [1,5,25] either ignore the
ISO dependency of the noise or are based on the assumption of a small range of ISO settings, further limiting the perfor-mance of learning-based noise modeling methods.
As a remedy, we propose a refined noise model to tap the potential of learning-based sensor noise modeling. As shown in Tab. 1, the proposed noise model covers the most common kind of noises in the imaging process, in-cluding shot noise Nshot, dark current fixed-pattern noise

Complete tion noise Nq. Among them, NF P , NBLE, and NDCSN jointly model the dark current noise NDC. Besides, the ISO dependence is also better considered compared to existing methods. The noise model is implemented in the normal-izing flow framework, and each component corresponds to a specific type of noise. Such configuration leverages the explicit distribution modeling ability of normalizing flow models, and the network architecture is also flexible enough to align accurately with our proposed noise model.
Apart from the inconsistency between existing noise models and the imaging process, another key factor imped-ing accurate noise modeling is the dataset. For obtaining the reference clean images, the SIDD dataset [2] overlays multiple noisy images, which leaves the black level error noise [9, 29, 31] and fixed-pattern noise [4, 21, 23] unable to remove. Another commonly used dataset SID [6] adopts the same ISO setting for pairwise long and short exposure im-ages, which results in the long exposure reference images still containing noises such as fixed-pattern noise. There-fore, for better training the proposed noise model, we have also collected a low-light image denoising (LLD) dataset, which contains pairs of noisy (short exposure, high ISO) and clean (long exposure, low ISO) images. Furthermore, we also provide flat-field and bias frames at various ISO settings in the LLD dataset, hoping it can facilitate the un-derstanding of real noise and image denoising research.
With the LLD dataset, we train the proposed noise model in a two-stage manner. Specifically, the noises are divided into two groups, i.e., the fixed-pattern noise and the ran-dom noise. Then the noise model is first trained to describe the random noise and then fitted to the fixed-pattern noise.
Thanks to the flexible structure and accurate modeling ca-pabilities, the proposed noise model can better capture the characteristics of real noise. The image denoising methods can also benefit from our noise model and achieve superior performance in extreme low-light scenes.
To sum up, the main contributions of this work include:
• We investigate the noise formation process in ex-treme low-light scenarios and propose a novel physics-guided noise model. The ISO dependence is taken into consideration in the proposed method.
• We collect a dataset for extreme low-light image de-noising. The dataset contains pairwise noisy-clean im-ages captured by two cameras (i.e., Sony A7S2 and
Nikon D850). We also provide flat-field and bias frames covering a wide range of ISO settings.
• While the learning-based nature eliminates the labor-intensive parameter hand-calibration process, our pro-posed method can achieve superior noise modeling ac-curacy and boost the image denoising performance. 2.
