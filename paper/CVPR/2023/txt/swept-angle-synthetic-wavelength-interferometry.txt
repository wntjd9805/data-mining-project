Abstract
We present a new imaging technique, swept-angle syn-thetic wavelength interferometry, for full-ﬁeld micron-scale 3D sensing. As in conventional synthetic wavelength interfer-ometry, our technique uses light consisting of two narrowly-separated optical wavelengths, resulting in per-pixel inter-ferometric measurements whose phase encodes scene depth.
Our technique additionally uses a new type of light source that, by emulating spatially-incoherent illumination, makes interferometric measurements insensitive to aberrations and (sub)surface scattering, effects that corrupt phase measure-ments. The resulting technique combines the robustness to such corruptions of scanning interferometric setups, with the speed of full-ﬁeld interferometric setups. Overall, our technique can recover full-frame depth at a lateral and ax-ial resolution of 5 µm, at frame rates of 5 Hz, even under strong ambient light. We build an experimental prototype, and use it to demonstrate these capabilities by scanning a variety of objects, including objects representative of ap-plications in inspection and fabrication, and objects that contain challenging light scattering effects. 1.

Introduction
Depth sensing is among the core problems of computer vision and computational imaging, with widespread appli-cations in medicine, industry, and robotics. An array of techniques is available for acquiring depth maps of three-dimensional (3D) scenes at different scales. In particular, micrometer-resolution depth sensing, our focus in this pa-per, is important in biomedical imaging because biological features are often micron-scale, industrial fabrication and inspection of critical parts that must conform to their speciﬁ-cations (Figure 1), and robotics to handle ﬁne objects.
Active illumination depth sensing techniques such as li-dar, structured light, and correlation time-of-ﬂight (ToF) cannot provide micrometer axial resolution. Instead, we focus on interferometric techniques that can achieve such resolutions. The operational principles and characteristics of interferometric techniques vary, depending on the type of active illumination and optical conﬁgurations they use.
The choice of illumination spectrum leads to techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), which uses broadband illumination, and phase-shifting interferometry (PSI), which uses monochromatic illumination. We consider

We show depth reconstructions for two scenes representative of these applications: millimeter-scale dents on an aircraft fuselage section, and a 3D-printed coin. synthetic wavelength interferometry (SWI), which operates between these two extremes: By using illumination con-sisting of two narrowly-separated optical wavelengths, SWI provides a controllable trade-off between the large unam-biguous depth range of OCT, and the large axial resolution of
PSI. SWI can achieve micrometer resolution at depth ranges in the order of hundreds of micrometers.
The choice of optical conﬁguration results in full-ﬁeld versus scanning implementations, which offer different trade-offs. Full-ﬁeld implementations acquire entire 2D depth maps, offering simultaneously fast operation and pixel-level lateral resolutions. However, full-ﬁeld implementations are very sensitive to effects that corrupt depth estimation, such as imperfections in free-space optics (e.g., lens aberrations) and indirect illumination (e.g., subsurface scattering). By contrast, scanning implementations use beam steering to se-quentially scan points in a scene and produce a 2D depth map. Scanning implementations offer robustness to depth corruption effects, through the use of ﬁber optics to reduce aberrations, and co-axial illumination and sensing to elimi-nate most indirect illumination. However, scanning makes acquiring depth maps with pixel-level lateral resolution and megapixel sizes impractically slow.
We develop a 3D sensing technique, swept-angle syn-thetic wavelength interferometry, that combines the com-plementary advantages of full-ﬁeld and scanning implemen-tations. We draw inspiration from previous work showing

The recovered depth shows ﬁne details such as the gaps between the wings reconstructed with high lateral and axial resolution. that the use of spatially-incoherent illumination in full-ﬁeld interferometry mitigates aberration and indirect illumination effects. We design a light source that emulates spatial inco-herence, by scanning within exposure a dichromatic point source at the focal plane of the illumination lens, effectively sweeping the illumination angle—hence swept-angle. We combine this light source with full-ﬁeld SWI, resulting in a 3D sensing technique with the following performance charac-teristics: 5 Hz full-frame 2 Mpixel acquisition; 5 µm lateral and axial resolution; range and resolution tunability; and robustness to aberrations, ambient illumination, and indi-rect illumination. We build an experimental prototype, and use it to demonstrate these capabilities, as in Figure 2. We provide setup details, reconstruction code, and data in the supplement and project website.1
Potential impact. Swept-angle SWI is relevant for critical applications, including industrial fabrication and inspection.
In industrial fabrication, swept-angle SWI can be used to pro-vide feedback during additive and subtractive manufacturing processes [67]. In industrial inspection, swept-angle SWI can be used to examine newly-fabricated or used in-place critical parts and ensure they comply with operational speci-ﬁcations. Swept-angle SWI, uniquely among 3D scanning techniques, offers a combination of features that are critical for both applications: First, high acquisition speed, which is necessary to avoid slowing down the manufacturing process, and to perform inspection efﬁciently. Second, micrometer lateral and axial resolution, which is necessary to detect crit-ical defects. Third, robustness to aberrations and indirect illumination, which is necessary because of the materials used for fabrication, which often have strong subsurface scat-tering. Figure 1 showcases results representative of these applications: We scan a fuselage section from a Boeing air-craft, to detect critical defects such as scratches and bumps from collisions, at axial and lateral scales of a couple dozen micrometers. We also scan a coin pattern 3D-printed by a commercial material printer on a translucent material. 2.
