Abstract
This study investigates unsupervised anomaly action recognition, which identifies video-level abnormal-human-behavior events in an unsupervised manner without abnor-mal samples, and simultaneously addresses three limita-tions in the conventional skeleton-based approaches: target domain-dependent DNN training, robustness against skele-ton errors, and a lack of normal samples. We present a unified, user prompt-guided zero-shot learning framework using a target domain-independent skeleton feature extrac-tor, which is pretrained on a large-scale action recogni-tion dataset. Particularly, during the training phase us-ing normal samples, the method models the distribution of skeleton features of the normal actions while freezing the weights of the DNNs and estimates the anomaly score us-ing this distribution in the inference phase. Additionally, to increase robustness against skeleton errors, we introduce a DNN architecture inspired by a point cloud deep learn-ing paradigm, which sparsely propagates the features be-tween joints. Furthermore, to prevent the unobserved nor-mal actions from being misidentified as abnormal actions, we incorporate a similarity score between the user prompt embeddings and skeleton features aligned in the common space into the anomaly score, which indirectly supplements normal actions. On two publicly available datasets, we con-duct experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to abovementioned limitations. 1.

Introduction
Anomaly action recognition, the task that detects whether the person(s) in the video is/are behaving abnor-mally [7,14,16,20,22,32,39,43], becomes an essential piece of technology for averting accidents and crimes [7,33]. The previous work can be classified into two methods that lever-age appearance information from the videos [7, 14, 39, 43] or only their human skeletons [16, 20, 22, 32]. With the

Figure 1. Modeling the distribution of skeleton features per video for identifying violent action samples as abnormal while only walking samples are observed as normal samples in the training phase. The decision boundary (black dotted line), which is learned from only normal samples, is shifted by the proposed prompt-guided anomaly score in the direction of embedding the prompt violence input by the user (red line). Handshake samples un-observed during the training are out-of-distribution but normal and are incorrectly recognized as abnormal without such prompt due to a lack of normal samples. However, by adding this prompt, hand-shake samples can be correctly identified as normal while walking samples are recognized as normal. help of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), the earlier methods identify abnormal actions by analyzing appearance features from videos. On the other hand, the latter methods use only low-information skeleton sequences extracted by applying multi-person pose estimation approaches [3, 10, 30] (simply referred to as pose detectors) to the videos and thus are rel-atively robust to changes in the appearances of the person and background [40].
Furthermore, the previous methods identify the abnor-mal actions for each frame [16, 22, 39, 43] or each video clip [7, 14, 20, 32]. They also follow supervised [7, 14, 32] or unsupervised [16, 20, 22, 39, 43] manners depending on whether annotations are given. Because the annotation cost is lower, the proposed method makes use of the skeleton-based approach, which recognizes abnormal actions at the video level in an unsupervised manner.
This study uses two assumptions; the users can define the
categories of abnormal actions1 (e.g., violence in Fig. 1), and the observed training samples consist of normal actions.
Additionally, unobserved training actions are referred to as out-of-distribution (OoD) (e.g., “handshake” and “pushing” in Fig. 1). The OoD actions include unobserved normal actions (e.g., only “handshake” in Fig. 1) when a sufficient variety of normal samples is not observed in the training phase.
This study focuses on limitations in the previous stud-ies [20, 22] to improve the scalability, such as expanding to different applications and enhancing the performance, as described below.
Target domain-dependent DNN training. The previous methods require time for training the DNNs with expensive computational resources for each scene when the applica-tions are initialized, or the domain shift between the training and inference phases occurs, such as changes in distribution over time. As a result, there are limitations on the applica-tions, and use restrictions are put in place.
Lack of normal samples. In the real-world scenario, a vari-ety of normal actions cannot be obtained to train the DNNs.
In such cases, most actions are regarded as abnormal, that is, normal but OoD actions are misidentified abnormal. Conse-quently, it is preferred that users be able to define the target abnormal and/or normal actions to be recognized, as shown in Fig. 1.
Robustness against skeleton errors. The majority of tra-ditional skeleton-based methods [16, 20, 22, 42] presup-pose that DNNs, like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), propagates the features densely between joints. Thus, the anomaly recognition accuracy degrades if joint detection er-rors (False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs)) oc-cur in the pose detection or if the multi-person pose tracking fails as a result of environmental noises, such as illumina-tion fluctuations.
To simultaneously overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel, prompt-guided zero-shot2 framework for recognizing abnormal actions using a pretrained deep fea-ture extractor with human skeleton sequences input. The method does not require observation of abnormal actions or their ground-truth labels to train DNNs. In particular, to ad-dress the first training limitation, we model the distribution of normal samples during the training3 phase by utilizing
DNNs with skeleton feature representations that have been pretrained on a sizable action recognition dataset, such as 1It is obvious that the normal actions can be defined as the opposite of the abnormal actions while we focus on the definition of the abnormal actions to simplify the explanation. 2We consider that normal samples do not directly contribute to rep-resentation learning, and thus follow a definition of zero-shot learning by
Xian et al. [41], which directly obtains representations of unknown classes. 3Training refers to learning normal and/or abnormal samples and is distinguished from pre-training on a dataset for action recognition, which does not learn such samples.
Kinetics-400 [4]. The weights of the skeleton feature ex-tractor are frozen during the training phase, and thus their features are relatively independent to the targeted domain.
To address the second normal-sample limitation, we re-duce the misdetections that the normal action is identified as abnormal by utilizing the text prompts regarding the ab-normal actions provided by the users to indirectly supple-ment the information of the normal actions. We integrate a similarity score between the skeleton features and the text embeddings extracted from a text encoder into the anomaly score. By implementing a contrastive learning scheme be-tween skeleton features and text embeddings, it can be ac-complished in the context of vision and language, which has been actively studied in recent years.
Inspired by a point cloud deep learning paradigm, we introduce a more straightforward DNN that sparsely prop-agates the features between joints as such a feature ex-tractor, improving the robustness against such skeleton er-rors in the third limitation mentioned above. This archi-tecture eliminates the constraints on input skeletons such as the input joint size and order, which are dependent on the dataset/domain. It allows us to divert the pretrained fea-ture extractor frozen across different domains/datasets with-out any fine-/hyperparameter-tuning and to simultaneously model both the distribution of normal samples and the joint-skeleton text embedding space over the domains/datasets.
In summary, the main contributions of this work are listed as follows: (1) We demonstrate experimentally that
DNN training with normal samples can be eliminated via the skeleton feature representations pretrained using a large-scale action recognition dataset. (2) We show that the zero-shot learning paradigm, which handles the skeleton features and text embeddings in the common space, can be efficient for modeling the distributions of the normal and abnormal actions. It is supported by a brand new unified framework that incorporates user guided text embeddings into the com-putation of the anomaly score. (3) We demonstrate experi-mentally that the permutation-invariant architecture, which sparsely propagates the features between joints, works as the skeleton feature extractor that models the normal sam-ples and the joint-skeleton text embedding space over do-mains and enhances robustness against skeleton errors. 2.
