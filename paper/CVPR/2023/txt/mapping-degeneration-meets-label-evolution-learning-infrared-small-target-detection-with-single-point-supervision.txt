Abstract
Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect infrared small targets in a fully supervised manner has gained remarkable research interests in recent years, but is highly labor expensive since a large number of per-pixel annotations are required. To handle this problem, in this paper, we make the ﬁrst attempt to achieve infrared small target detection with point-level supervision. Interestingly, during the training phase supervised by point labels, we discover that CNNs ﬁrst learn to segment a cluster of pixels near the targets, and then gradually converge to predict groundtruth point labels. Motivated by this
“mapping degeneration” phenomenon, we propose a label evolution framework named label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) to progressively expand the point label by leveraging the intermediate predictions of
CNNs.
In this way, the network predictions can ﬁnally approximate the updated pseudo labels, and a pixel-level target mask can be obtained to train CNNs in an end-to-end manner. We conduct extensive experiments with insightful visualizations to validate the effectiveness of our method.
Experimental results show that CNNs equipped with LESPS can well recover the target masks from corresponding point labels, and can achieve over 70% and 95% of their fully supervised performance in terms of pixel-level intersection over union (IoU ) and object-level probability of detection (Pd), respectively.

Introduction
Infrared small target detection has been a longstanding,  fundamental  yet  challenging  task  in  infrared  search  and  tracking systems, and has various important applications in  civil and military fields [49,57], including traffic monitoring

[24, 54], maritime rescue [52, 53] and military surveillance
[7, 47]. Due to the rapid response and robustness to fast-moving scenes, single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection methods have always attracted much more attention, and numerous methods have been proposed.
Early methods, local contrast-based [3, 16] and low rank-based [11, 43] methods, require complex handcrafted features with carefully tuned hyper-parameters. Recently, compact deep learning has been introduced in solving the problem of SIRST detection
[24, 45, 54]. However, there are only a few attempts, and its potential remains locked, unlike the extensive explorations of deep learning for natural images. This is mainly due to potential reasons, including lack of large-scale, accurately annotated datasets and high stake application scenarios.
Infrared small targets are usually of very small size, weak, shapeless and textureless, and are easily submerged in diverse complex background clutters. As a result, directly adopting existing popular generic object detectors like RCNN series [13, 14, 19, 39], YOLO series [25, 37, 38] and SSD [29] to SIRST detection cannot produce satisfactory performance. Realizing this, researchers have been focusing on developing deep networks tailored for
infrared small targets by adequately utilizing the domain knowledge. However, most existing deep methods for
SIRST detection [8, 24, 54] are fully supervised, which usually requires a large dataset with accurate target mask annotations for training. Clearly, this is costly [5, 26].
Therefore, a natural question arises: Can we develop a new framework for SIRST detection with single point supervision? In fact, to substantially reduce the annotation cost for object detection tasks, weakly supervised object detection methods with point supervision [4, 5, 26, 56] have been studied in the ﬁeld of computer vision. Although these weakly supervised methods achieve promising results, they are not designed for the problem of SIRST detection, (i.e., only foreground and the class-agnostic labels and background) of infrared small targets hinder their applications [42, 58]. Therefore, in this work, we intend to conduct the ﬁrst study of weakly supervised SIRST detection with single-point supervision.
A key motivation of this work comes from an interesting observation during the training of SIRST detection networks. That is, with single point labels serving as supervision, CNNs always tend to segment a cluster of pixels near the targets with low conﬁdence at the early stage, and then gradually learn to predict groundtruth (GT) point labels with high conﬁdence, as shown in Fig. 1.
It reveals the fact that region-to-region mapping is the intermediate result of the ﬁnal region-to-point mapping1.
We attribute this “mapping degeneration” phenomenon to the special imaging mechanism of infrared system [24, 54], the local contrast prior of infrared small targets [3, 8], and the easy-to-hard learning property of CNNs [44], in which the ﬁrst two factors result in extended mapping regions beyond the point labels, and the last factor contributes to the degeneration process.
Based on the aforementioned discussion, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the problem of weakly supervised SIRST detection, dubbed label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS). Speciﬁcally, LESPS leverages the intermediate network predictions in the training phase to update the current labels, which serve as supervision until the next label update. Through iterative label update and network training, the network predictions can ﬁnally approximate the updated pseudo mask labels, and the network can be simultaneously trained to achieve pixel-level SIRST detection in an end-to-end2 manner.
