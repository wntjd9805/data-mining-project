Abstract
Skeleton-based human action recognition is becoming increasingly important in a variety of fields. Most exist-ing works train a CNN or GCN based backbone to extract spatial-temporal features, and use temporal average/max pooling to aggregate the information. However, these pool-ing methods fail to capture high-order dynamics informa-tion. To address the problem, we propose a plug-and-play module called Koopman pooling, which is a param-eterized high-order pooling technique based on Koopman theory. The Koopman operator linearizes a non-linear dy-namics system, thus providing a way to represent the com-plex system through the dynamics matrix, which can be used for classification. We also propose an eigenvalue nor-malization method to encourage the learned dynamics to be non-decaying and stable. Besides, we also show that our Koopman pooling framework can be easily extended to one-shot action recognition when combined with Dynamic
Mode Decomposition. The proposed method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, 120 and NW-UCLA. Our experiments clearly demonstrate that
Koopman pooling significantly improves the performance under both full-dataset and one-shot settings. 1.

Introduction
Skeleton-based human action recognition is a crucial task in many applications, ranging from video surveillance to autonomous driving and human-robot interaction. With the prevalence of deep learning, the rising of LSTM, CNN and GCN has significantly improved the performance of ac-tion recognition. Most existing methods [9,13,28,46,70,73] use a CNN or GCN based backbone to extract complex spatial-temporal features, and use temporal average/max pooling to aggregate the information. However, vanilla tem-poral average/max pooling contains only first-order infor-mation and abandons higher-order statistical information.

Koopman Pooling
Figure 1. Most existing works use temporal average pooling to aggregate the information along the temporal dimension (left), and only first-order information is considered. Our proposed Koopman pooling (right) instead focuses on the true latent dynamics of the sequence in linear Koopman space, and learns a set of class-wise
Koopman dynamics matrices to represent the dynamics of each class. The classification is achieved by dynamics matching.
To this end, recent works focus on second-order pool-ing to capture second-order information of the feature se-quences. Specifically, bilinear and covariance pooling is widely used to extract second-order statistical information from the feature sequence. Early works [14] use sim-ple bilinear pooling to model the interaction of features and aggregate temporal information.
In recent years, re-searchers proposed to use covariance pooling [22] to cap-ture second-order statistical information, as covariance ma-trix can model the interaction between features while main-taining good geometrical structure [31]. However, the skeleton sequence as well as the extracted feature sequence has complex underlying dynamics in nature. Existing meth-ods such as covariance pooling only exploit the feature in-teraction between frames or channels, but they fail to dis-cover the true dynamics of the sequence. Instead, we aim
to directly focus on the temporal dynamics of the sequence and conduct sequence recognition based on class-specific dynamics.
A critical motivating idea of this work is the applica-tion of Koopman theory [26]. The original Koopman the-ory aims to re-formulate a non-linear dynamical system to be a linear one. To this end, a Koopman operator is required to lift the original features into some possibly infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, wherein the evolution of the dynamics becomes linear. Such a treatment is fa-vored in numerous applications, including time-series anal-ysis, since an arsenal of spectral-analysis tools can facilitate the in-depth investigation of the model (such as the tempo-ral stability property). In practice, identifying the optimal
Koopman operator of a specific dynamic system remains a challenge. Besides conventional dynamic mode decompo-sition (DMD) [6], recent years also witnessed the utilization of black-box neural network for learning the Koopman op-erator in differentiable fashion [1, 23, 38, 42, 61].
To our best knowledge, the proposed Koopman pooling in this paper is the first work to leverage the power of Koop-man theory to formulate a new high-order pooling method.
Unlike existing methods like covariance pooling which use covariance matrix to model the temporal correlation of fea-tures implicitly, we instead view the temporal evolution of feature vectors as a dynamical system, and use the dynam-ics itself to model the temporal correlation explicitly. As shown in figure 1, the original trajectories are mapped to a new embedding space where the temporal evolution is lin-ear. The transition matrix of this linear system can therefore be viewed as the signature of this sequence, which contains rich high-order information. For the classification task, our model learns the class-wise Koopman matrices which represent class-specific dynamics, and conducts dynamics matching to obtain the classification score. Based on our observation of the learned dynamics, this paper highlight the critical importance of the stability of learned dynamics when tackling recognition tasks, and propose an eigenvalue normalization technique to push the learned linear dynam-ics to be stable and non-decaying. We also combine Koop-man pooling and dynamic mode decomposition(DMD) to formulate a new framework for one-shot action recognition, which uses dynamics to match the sequence instead of the common practice of computing distance in the embedding space or conducting metric learning.
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 skeleton-based action recognition datasets, namely NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA. The results demonstrate that Koop-man pooling significantly improves the performance under both full-dataset and one-shot settings.
To be summarized, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• We proposed Koopman pooling, which is the first work in the literature to design a plug-and-play high-order pooling method based on Koopman theory that allows eigenvalue manipulation and one-shot recognition.
• We emphasize the critical importance of learning a sta-ble and non-decaying system for recognition tasks and accordingly design an eigenvalue normalization tech-nique based on control theory.
• Our comprehensive experiments based on various backbones [9, 28, 68] on the commonly used bench-mark datasets NTU RGB+D 60/120 and NW-UCLA shows Koopman pooling significantly improves the performance under both full-dataset and one-shot set-ting. 2.
