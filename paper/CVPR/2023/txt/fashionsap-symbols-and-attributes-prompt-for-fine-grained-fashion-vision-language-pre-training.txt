Abstract
Fashion vision-language pre-training models have shown efﬁcacy for a wide range of downstream tasks.
However, general vision-language pre-training models pay less attention to ﬁne-grained domain features, while these features are important in distinguishing the speciﬁc do-main tasks from general tasks. We propose a method for
ﬁne-grained fashion vision-language pre-training based on fashion Symbols and Attributes Prompt (FashionSAP) to model ﬁne-grained multi-modalities fashion attributes and characteristics. Firstly, we propose the fashion symbols, a novel abstract fashion concept layer, to represent differ-ent fashion items and to generalize various kinds of ﬁne-grained fashion features, making modelling ﬁne-grained attributes more effective. Secondly, the attributes prompt method is proposed to make the model learn speciﬁc at-tributes of fashion items explicitly. We design proper prompt templates according to the format of fashion data. Compre-hensive experiments are conducted on two public fashion benchmarks, i.e., FashionGen and FashionIQ, and Fash-ionSAP gets SOTA performances for four popular fashion tasks. The ablation study also shows the proposed abstract fashion symbols, and the attribute prompt method enables the model to acquire ﬁne-grained semantics in the fashion domain effectively. The obvious performance gains from
FashionSAP provide a new baseline for future fashion task research.1 1.

Introduction
Vision-Language pre-training (VLP) attracts wide atten-tion [10, 16–18, 43] as a foundation for general multi-modal tasks. VLP methods aim at learning multimodal knowledge

The captions of the general domain only describe object-level (underlined words) image content, while fashion do-main captions emphasise attribute-level semantics. from large-scale text and image pairs data containing com-mon objects in daily life. For example, MSCOCO [19], a public vision-language benchmark, is introduced with com-mon object labels. The fashion domain is an important application of VLP methods, where the online retail mar-ket needs retrieval and recommendation services. To sat-isfy such requirements, the VLP model needs to learn high-quality representations containing ﬁne-grained attributes from the fashion data.
Many works have adapted general VLP models to fash-ion tasks directly. However, the general pre-training mod-els are not effective for learning fashion knowledge to de-scribe fashion items comprehensively, as the fashion de-scriptions are usually associated with ﬁne-grained attribute-level features. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the description text of a fashion item (right) refers to ﬁne-grained attributes like long sleeves, while such features are ignored by the de-Fashion Symbols

More-over, the public fashion producers from fashion platforms attach great importance to some deﬁnite attributes (e.g., season, gender) of fashion data and especially provide the fashion attributes annotations. However, these high-quality attributes are highly neglected by existing fashion VLP models. It is important for fashion VLP models to focus on these ﬁne-grained attributes and learn fashion-speciﬁc knowledge.
Fashion attributes describe not only item details but also the overall item features. The category for fashion items is an essential attribute highlighted by many benchmark datasets [31, 42, 50]. We notice that categories have a deep correlation to ﬁne-grained attributes, although they describe the general information of a fashion item. For example, the length is an important attribute for both pants and jeans, while it is rarely mentioned in the description of a pair of shoes. However, most existing fashion VLP methods ne-glect the importance of the relationship between similar cat-egories.
In this paper, we explore the usage of category attributes as a global concept layer during pre-training. Ac-cording to the human description of a fashion product, we believe categories declare the basic understanding of a fash-ion product. Therefore, we attach the fashion category to the beginning of captions to guide the representation learn-ing. Since the fashion products are designed for the decora-tion of people, we summarize nine fashion symbols corre-sponding to human body parts, as shown in Tab. 1, to unify all the categories of fashion items.
We propose a method for the fashion domain to learn
ﬁne-grained semantics. This method is able to capture the similarity of ﬁne-grained features based on fashion sym-bols and learn explicit ﬁne-grained fashion attributes by the prompt. Our method gets the SOTA performance for four popular fashion tasks on the two public datasets, and the ob-vious performance gains provide new baselines for further research. Our main contributions are summarized below:
• An effective ﬁne-grained vision-language pre-training model is proposed to learn the attribute-level fashion knowledge.
• An abstract fashion concept layer is proposed, and 9 fashion symbols are summarized to represent vari-ous fashion concepts according to their similarities on body parts and product functions.
• The attributes prompt method enables the cross-modalities pre-training model to explicitly learn ﬁne-grained fashion characteristics. 2.
