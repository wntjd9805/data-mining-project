Abstract
Open world object detection (OWOD) has attracted ex-tensive attention due to its practicability in the real world.

Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective Annealing-based Label-Transfer framework, which sufficiently explores the known proposals to allevi-ate the uncertainties. Specifically, a Label-Transfer Learn-ing paradigm is introduced to decouple the known and un-known features, while a Sawtooth Annealing Scheduling strategy is further employed to rebuild the decision bound-aries of the known and unknown classes, thus promoting both known and unknown recognition. Moreover, previ-ous OWOD works neglected the trade-off of known and un-known performance, and we thus introduce a metric called
Equilibrium Index to comprehensively evaluate the effec-tiveness of the OWOD models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OWOD work without manual unknown selec-tion. Extensive experiments conducted on the common-used benchmark validate that our model achieves superior detec-tion performance (200% unknown mAP improvement with the even higher known detection performance) compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

In contrast, we view object detection as an object-level feature entanglement and explore unknown information from all the known proposals. classes must be labeled and given during training. However, an object detection system is highly likely to encounter un-known objects that do not appear in the training phase. To address the above problem, Open World Object Detection (OWOD) has been pioneeringly proposed in [17], where the detection models should identify both known (annotated) and unknown (unannotated) categories and incrementally learn the unknown classes once their annotations are given.
As shown in Figure 1, to accomplish unknown identi-fication, previous OWOD works manually designed com-plex unknown-discover strategies to select specific regions from the background as unknown proposals, which will introduce uncertainties in the open world learning. For example, ORE [17] adopted an auto-labelling strategy in
RPN, which selected top-k background region proposals sorted by their objectness scores as unknown objects. OW-DETR [10] further designed an attention-driven pseudo-labeling for selecting query boxes with high attention scores but not matched with known class boxes. Although these works [10, 17, 39, 42, 45] achieved promising performance and improved the unknown recall, these unknown-discover strategies are much likely to choose parts of the known pro-posals or the authentic background regions, introducing too many uncertainties. These low-quality unknown proposals do not necessarily contain meaningful semantic patterns to accomplish the unknown recognition, and may also degrade the detection performance of known categories.
Different from previous works, we claim that the learn-ing of object detection could be seen as an object-level feature-entanglement process through the local-connected convolution computation. That is to say, the features of each region inside the image could be propagated and closely entangled with each other, and thus a known proposal en-compasses not only its own class-specific traits but also the propagated context information with potential unknown features. Empirical evidence also supports this point that even a closed world detection model is capable of extract-ing unknown features without unknown-discovery strate-gies, which will be further illustrated in Section 3.2.
Therefore, in this paper, to alleviate the uncertainties of manually selecting unknown proposals, we proposed a simple yet effective Annealing-based Label-Transfer frame-work for the open world object detection task. Our model sufficiently utilizes all the known proposals to distill un-known features of meaningful semantic patterns and pro-motes the collaborative learning of known and unknown classes. It follows a Label-Transfer Learning with a Saw-tooth Annealing Scheduling.
Specifically, the Label-Transfer Learning disentangles the meaningful unknown features from all known propos-als to accomplish unknown recognition, effectively reduc-ing the uncertainties. Since it is non-trivial to directly de-couple the features within a known proposal, the known la-bel is transferred to the unknown class and thus decoupled into two classes, to guide the model decouple the learning of unknown and known traits. This strategy is intuitive and easy to implement, without complex and excessive compu-tations in the forward process. Since most images simul-taneously contain known and unknown objects, it could ef-fectively distill the unknown traits of meaningful semantic patterns from the known proposals. Hence, it subtly avoids selecting unknown proposals and alleviates uncertainties.
Moreover, the Sawtooth Annealing Scheduling strategy meticulously adjusts the disentanglement degree to encour-age the collaborative learning of both known and unknown classes. In our Label-Transfer Learning, since we cannot access the unknown supervision, it is hard to tell its entan-glement extent and thus nontrivial to determine disentan-glement level. If the disentanglement level is too small, we cannot well sufficiently mine the unknown traits. In con-trast, if we over-disentangle the features, the informative known semantic will be dramatically destroyed and may adversely affect unknown identification either. Thus, it is critical to determine the suitable disentanglement level, to appropriately guide the unknown identification while main-taining the known detection performance. The concept “an-nealing” is borrowed from material science, where atoms within a solid material will redistribute under certain tem-perature control and reach an equilibrium state. Through our Sawtooth Annealing Scheduling strategy, the decision boundaries will be rebuilt with the consideration of both known and unknown classes, thus harmoniously promoting both the known and unknown learning to reach equilibrium.
The proposed Annealing-based Label-Transfer OWOD model is the first OWOD work without manually select-ing unknown proposals, and achieves state-of-the-art per-formance. In addition, unlike previous models only report-ing the unknown recall performance, we further present the unknown mAP performance and introduce a novel eval-uation metric Equilibrium Index (EI) to comprehensively measure the unknown and known detection performance.
In summary, our contributions are:
• We view object detection as an object-level feature entanglement and propose an Annealing-based Label-Transfer Learning, which is the first OWOD work without manually selecting unknown proposals.
• We introduce Label-Transfer Learning to disentangle the meaningful unknown traits from all known propos-als, alleviating the uncertainties.
• We design a Sawtooth Annealing Scheduling strategy to adjust the disentanglement degree, ensuring the col-laborative learning of known and unknown classes.
• A new OWOD evaluation metric Equilibrium Index is proposed to comprehensively evaluate known and un-known detection performance.
• Extensive experiments conducted on the commonly-used dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we report a substantial increase in unknown mAP performance (200% gains compared to previous state-of-the-arts with an even better known detection performance). 2.
