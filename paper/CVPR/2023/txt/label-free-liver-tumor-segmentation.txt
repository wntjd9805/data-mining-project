Abstract
We demonstrate that AI models can accurately segment liver tumors without the need for manual annotation by us-ing synthetic tumors in CT scans. Our synthetic tumors have two intriguing advantages: (I) realistic in shape and texture, which even medical professionals can confuse with real tumors; (II) effective for training AI models, which can perform liver tumor segmentation similarly to the model trained on real tumors—this result is exciting because no existing work, using synthetic tumors only, has thus far reached a similar or even close performance to real tumors.
This result also implies that manual efforts for annotating tumors voxel by voxel (which took years to create) can be significantly reduced in the future. Moreover, our synthetic tumors can automatically generate many examples of small (or even tiny) synthetic tumors and have the potential to im-prove the success rate of detecting small liver tumors, which is critical for detecting the early stages of cancer. In addi-tion to enriching the training data, our synthesizing strategy also enables us to rigorously assess the AI robustness. 1.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated medical image segmentation [21,26,73–75], but training an AI model (e.g.,
U-Net [48]) often requires a large number of annotations.
Annotating medical images is not only expensive and time-consuming, but also requires extensive medical expertise, and sometimes needs the assistance of radiology reports and biopsy results to achieve annotation accuracy [12, 52, 59, 69–71]. Due to its high annotation cost, only roughly 200
CT scans with annotated liver tumors are publicly available (provided by LiTS [5]) for training and testing models.

To minimize annotation expenses, generating synthetic tumors is an emerging research topic. Early attempts in-clude, but only limited to, synthesizing COVID-19 infec-tions [41,63], lung nodules [19] abdominal tumors [27], dia-betic lesions [57], and brain tumors [60]. However, the syn-thetic tumors in those studies appear very different from the real tumors; due to this, AI models trained using synthetic tumors perform significantly worse than those trained us-ing real tumors. What makes synthesizing tumors so hard?
There are several important factors: shape, intensity, size, location, and texture. In this paper, we handcraft a strat-egy to synthesize liver tumors in abdominal CT scans. Our key novelties include (i) location without collision with ves-sels, (ii) texture with scaled-up Gaussian noise, and (iii) shape generated from distorted ellipsoids. These three as-pects are proposed according to the clinical knowledge of liver tumors (detailed in §3.2). The resulting synthetic tu-mors are realistic—even medical professionals usually con-fuse them with real tumors in the visual examination (Fig-ure 1; Table 2). In addition, the model trained on our syn-thetic tumors achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 59.81% for segmenting real liver tumors, whereas AI trained on real tumors obtains a DSC of 57.63% (Figure 2), showing that synthetic tumors have the potential to be used as an alternative to real tumors in training AI models.
These results are exciting because using synthetic tu-mors only, no previous work has thus far reached a sim-ilar (or even close) performance to the model trained on real tumors [24]. Moreover, our synthesizing strategy can exhaustively generate tumors with desired locations, sizes, shapes, textures, and intensities, which are not limited to a fixed finite-size training set (the well-known limitation of the conventional training paradigm [65]). For example, it is hard to collect sufficient training examples with small tu-mors. It is because early-stage tumors may not cause symp-toms, which can delay detection, and these tumors are rela-Figure 1. [Better viewed in color and zoomed in for details] Can you tell which liver tumors are real and which are fake? The answers are provided in Appendix. We have recruited two medical professionals with at least six years of experience to distinguish fake tumors, generated by our method, from the real ones (namely, Visual Turing Test). Our synthetic tumors have passed the Visual Turing Test on both two medical professionals (<50% fake tumors were picked out). More importantly, using our label-free synthetic tumors, AI models can segment real tumors with performance similar to the AI models trained on real tumors with expensive, detailed, per-voxel annotation. tively small and exhibit subtle abnormal textures that make it difficult for radiologists to manually delineate the tumor boundaries. In contrast, our synthesis strategy can generate a large number of examples featuring small tumors. The key contribution of ours is a synthetic tumor generator, which offers five advantages as summarized below.
These results have the potential to stimulate a shift in the tumor segmentation training paradigm, as illustrated in Fig-ure 2, from label-intensive to label-free AI development for tumor segmentation. Our ultimate goal is to train AI models for tumor segmentation without using manual annotation— this study makes a significant step towards it. 1. The synthesis strategy embeds medical knowledge into an executable program, enabling the generation of re-alistic tumors through the collaboration of radiologists and computer scientists (§5.1; Table 2; Figure 3). 2. The entire training stage requires no annotation cost, and the resulting model significantly outperforms pre-vious unsupervised anomaly segmentation approaches and tumor synthesis strategies (§5.2; Table 3). 3. The AI model trained on synthetic tumors can achieve similar performance to AI models trained on real tu-mors with per-voxel annotation in real tumors segmen-tation, and can be generalized to CT scans with healthy liver and scans from other hospitals (§5.3; Figure 4). 4. The synthesis strategy can generate a variety of tumors for model training, including those at small, medium, and large scales, and therefore have the potential to de-tect small tumors and facilitate the early detection of liver cancer (§5.4; Figure 5). 5. The synthesis strategy allows for straightforward ma-nipulation of parameters such as tumor location, size, texture, shape, and intensity, providing a comprehen-sive test-bed for evaluating AI models under out-of-distribution scenarios (§5.5; Figure 6). 2.
