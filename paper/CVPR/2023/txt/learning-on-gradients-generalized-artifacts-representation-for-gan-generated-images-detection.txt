Abstract
Recently, there has been a significant advancement in image generation technology, known as GAN. It can easily generate realistic fake images, leading to an increased risk of abuse. However, most image detectors suffer from sharp performance drops in unseen domains. The key of fake im-age detection is to develop a generalized representation to describe the artifacts produced by generation models. In this work, we introduce a novel detection framework, named
Learning on Gradients (LGrad), designed for identifying
GAN-generated images, with the aim of constructing a gen-eralized detector with cross-model and cross-data. Specif-ically, a pretrained CNN model is employed as a trans-formation model to convert images into gradients. Sub-sequently, we leverage these gradients to present the gen-eralized artifacts, which are fed into the classifier to as-certain the authenticity of the images. In our framework, we turn the data-dependent problem into a transformation-model-dependent problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize gradients as the representa-tion of artifacts in GAN-generated images. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of gradients as generalized artifact representations. Our de-tector achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a remarkable gain of 11.4%. The code is released at https:

Introduction
Over the past years, remarkable progress has been made in deep generative models, i.e. generative adversarial net-works (GAN) [14], its variations [3, 21–23, 36], and VAE
[25]. The generated media is highly realistic and indistin-*Corresponding author

Although it has the po-tential for many novel applications [8], it also brings new risks due to the abuse of fake information. The misuse of DeepFakes has been confirmed that some people swap the faces of women onto pornographic videos [8]. In addi-tion, some individuals, even non-experts, can malevolently manipulate or create fake images or videos for political or economic purposes, leading to serious social problems [17].
Thus, it is extremely necessary to develop forgery detection techniques to help people determine the credibility of the
media [17, 40].
Various detectors [11–13,16,18,19,30,42,45] have been developed to detect GAN-generated images. Some stud-ies [16, 30, 45] focus on human face images, while oth-ers [11,18,19,42] handle various categories of images. They mainly depend on local regions artifacts [4, 44], blending boundary [26], global textures [30], and frequency-level ar-tifacts [13, 18, 19, 45]. However, those methods heavily rely on the training settings, resulting in failure detection of images from unseen categories or GAN models. The test images in the actual scene are always from unknown sources [17], rendering it challenging to develop gener-alized detectors. There are some works [19, 42] exploit-ing pre-processing, data augmentation, and reducing the ef-fects of frequency-level artifacts to develop a robust detec-tor. Nevertheless, there still needs to be a more generalized representation of the clue produced by generation models, which is critical for robust fake image detection.
To tackle this problem, we propose a novel and simple detection framework, referred to as Learning on Gradients (LGrad). A new generalized feature, Gradients, is devel-oped to serve as a representation of the artifacts produced by GAN models. We believe that the gradients of a trained
CNN model can highlight the important pixels in the tar-get task, thereby serving as a valuable cue for detecting fake images. As shown in Figure 1, we adopt a pre-trained discriminator of ProGAN [21] to extract gradients of im-ages produced by Celeba-HQ [21], ProGAN [21], Style-GAN [22], StyleGAN2 [23]. In these gradients, the content of images is filtered out, and only the discriminative pixels that are relevant to the pre-trained model’s target task are re-tained. Therefore, the gradients are more dependent on the pre-trained model rather than on training sources, thereby enhancing the detector’s performance with unseen data. In our framework, a pretrained model, called transformation model, is employed to convert images to gradients. These gradients serve as the generalized artifacts and are fed into the classifier to obtain a robust detector. Since the transfor-mation model is indeterminate in our framework, targeted anti-detection cannot be effectively launched.
To validate the performance of our LGrad, we only use images generated by ProGAN to train the detector and eval-uate it with various sources, including cross-category, cross-model, and cross-model & category. Numerous experi-ments prove the effectiveness and robustness of gradients as generalized artifacts. Our detector achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in known and unseen settings.
Our paper makes the following contributions:
• We develop a new detection framework, Learning on
Gradient (LGrad), to detect GAN-generated images.
Our detector achieves a new state-of-the-art perfor-mance.
• We introduce a new generalized artifact representation,
Gradients, for GAN-generated image detection. Fur-thermore, we are the first to use gradients as the repre-sentation of artifacts.
• Our framework turns the data-driven problem into a transformation-model-driven problem. The robustness of the detector is improved with the introduction of the transformation model.
• We prove the great potential of the discriminator of
GAN in detecting GAN-generated images. 2.
