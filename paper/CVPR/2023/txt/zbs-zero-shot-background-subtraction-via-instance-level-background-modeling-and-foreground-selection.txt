Abstract
Background subtraction (BGS) aims to extract all mov-ing objects in the video frames to obtain binary foreground segmentation masks. Deep learning has been widely used in this field. Compared with supervised-based BGS methods, unsupervised methods have better generalization. However, previous unsupervised deep learning BGS algorithms per-form poorly in sophisticated scenarios such as shadows or night lights, and they cannot detect objects outside the pre-defined categories. In this work, we propose an unsuper-vised BGS algorithm based on zero-shot object detection called Zero-shot Background Subtraction (ZBS). The pro-posed method fully utilizes the advantages of zero-shot ob-ject detection to build the open-vocabulary instance-level background model. Based on it, the foreground can be ef-fectively extracted by comparing the detection results of new frames with the background model. ZBS performs well for sophisticated scenarios, and it has rich and extensible cat-egories. Furthermore, our method can easily generalize to other tasks, such as abandoned object detection in unseen environments. We experimentally show that ZBS surpasses state-of-the-art unsupervised BGS methods by 4.70% F-Measure on the CDnet 2014 dataset. The code is released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/ZBS. 1.
