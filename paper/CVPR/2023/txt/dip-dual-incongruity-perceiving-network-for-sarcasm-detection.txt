Abstract
Sarcasm indicates the literal meaning is contrary to the real attitude. Considering the popularity and complemen-tarity of image-text data, we investigate the task of multi-modal sarcasm detection. Diﬀerent from other multi-modal tasks, for the sarcastic data, there exists intrinsic incon-gruity between a pair of image and text as demonstrated in psychological theories. To tackle this issue, we pro-pose a Dual Incongruity Perceiving (DIP) network con-sisting of two branches to mine the sarcastic information from factual and aﬀective levels. For the factual aspect, we introduce a channel-wise reweighting strategy to ob-tain semantically discriminative embeddings, and leverage gaussian distribution to model the uncertain correlation caused by the incongruity. The distribution is generated from the latest data stored in the memory bank, which can adaptively model the diﬀerence of semantic similarity be-tween sarcastic and non-sarcastic data. For the aﬀective aspect, we utilize siamese layers with shared parameters to learn cross-modal sentiment information. Furthermore, we use the polarity value to construct a relation graph for the mini-batch, which forms the continuous contrastive loss to acquire aﬀective embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is released on https://github.com/downdric/MSD. 1.

Introduction
Sarcasm is an interesting and prevailing manner to ex-press users’ opinions [18], which means the real attitude is converse to the literal meaning [19]. With the develop-ment of social platforms, sarcasm detection (SD) attracts increasing attention [11, 40, 65] due to its wide application, e.g. product review analysis, political opinion mining [32], etc. Automatically distinguishing sarcastic instances from

Figure 1. Examples from the sarcasm dataset [6]. (a) shows the samples (left) and statistics (right) for factual incongruity. Ac-quiring inter-modal semantic similarity 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 from CLIP [50], the factual incongruity is depicted by 1 − 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 . (b) displays the cases for aﬀective incongruity. Obtaining the models trained on FI (image) [70] and IMDB (text) [41] datasets, the incongruity is rep-resented by the diﬀerence in sentiment polarity. For both groups of samples, the top two samples are sarcastic data, and the bottom two samples are non-sarcastic ones. the mass of non-sarcastic content is important for any on-line service.
The challenge of multi-modal sarcasm detection (MSD) mainly comes from two aspects. First, the task aims to de-tect implicit intention from data, which increases the diﬃ-culty of learning. Speciﬁcally, compared with visual recog-nition, the expressed attitude of the sarcastic data com-monly hides in a normal stimulus and is hard to be iden-tiﬁed. Fortunately, the linguistic theory demonstrates that incongruity is an important and eﬀective factor for sarcasm detection [29], which inspires researchers automatically ex-tract the positive and negative seeds [51]. Another challenge lies in that, while both image and text express similar infor-mation is expected in multi-modal tasks [3, 50], this rule is not applicable to SD that discovering dissimilar informa-tion. There exists an intrinsic conﬂict between oﬀ-the-shelf techniques for multi-modal learning and the new task in this work.
In order to address the issue, we focus on the inter-modal incongruity for MSD. Sarcasm is a long standing topic in various areas like psychology [43], sociology [54], and neu-robiology [31]. Researchers observe that sarcasm occurs when the literal meaning unexpectedly contrasts with the observed facts [22, 43]. The process is deﬁned as counter-factual inference [43]. Besides, the studies from empiri-cal theory [55] ﬁnd that attitude is another important factor, which is especially eﬀective for obscure cases. In light of these theoretical works, we utilize semantic association and sentiment polarity to verify the incongruity in the sarcasm dataset [6]. As shown in Figure 1, the incongruity of sar-castic data is obviously larger than the non-sarcastic one in factual level, especially in terms of the mean value. Mean-while, the phenomenon also exists in the aﬀective level. In-spired by the study and veriﬁcation above, we design our method to detect the incongruity for multi-modal sarcastic data in both the factual and aﬀective levels.
We propose a Dual Incongruity Perceiving (DIP) net-work, which is consisting of Semantic Intensiﬁed Distri-bution (SID) Modeling and Siamese Sentiment Contrastive (SSC) Learning modules. In SID, based on the semantic as-sociation [9, 44], the samples are diﬀerentiated by an adap-tive strategy. Speciﬁcally, we maintain gaussian distribu-tions for sarcastic and non-sarcastic samples respectively, and utilize the probability generated by them to model the incongruity. Since the distributions depend on the extracted embeddings, we introduce a channel-wise reweighting strat-egy to learn representations related to sarcasm.
In SSC, the aﬀective incongruity is perceived by the polarity dif-ference between the image-text pair. To eﬃciently intro-duce sentiment information into the network, we employ two siamese layers to transmit knowledge of aﬀective dic-tionary, i.e. SenticNet. Furthermore, with the help of the polarity intensity, the continuous contrastive learning is pro-posed to enhance the aﬀective representations. Overall, the facutal and aﬀective information are intensiﬁed in SID and
SSC, and leveraged to explicitly calculate the incongruity for MSD.
Our contributions are three-fold: (1) To our knowledge,
DIP is the ﬁrst work explicitly investigating and model-ing incongruity in multi-modal sarcasm detection. (2) It’s a dual perceiving network to learn sarcastic information from factual and aﬀective levels, which utilizes channel-wise reweighting and continuous contrastive strategies to acquire discriminative representations. (3) Extensive com-parisons and ablations demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and su-periority of the proposed method. 2.
