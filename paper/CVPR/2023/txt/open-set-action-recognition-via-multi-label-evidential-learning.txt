Abstract
Existing methods for open set action recognition focus on novelty detection that assumes video clips show a single action, which is unrealistic in the real world. We propose a new method for open set action recognition and novelty de-tection via MUlti-Label Evidential learning (MULE), that goes beyond previous novel action detection methods by addressing the more general problems of single or multi-ple actors in the same scene, with simultaneous action(s) by any actor. Our Beta Evidential Neural Network esti-mates multi-action uncertainty with Beta densities based on actor-context-object relation representations. An evi-dence debiasing constraint is added to the objective func-tion for optimization to reduce the static bias of video rep-resentations, which can incorrectly correlate predictions and static cues. We develop a primal-dual average scheme update-based learning algorithm to optimize the proposed problem and provide corresponding theoretical analysis.
Besides, uncertainty and belief-based novelty estimation mechanisms are formulated to detect novel actions. Exten-sive experiments on two real-world video datasets show that our proposed approach achieves promising performance in single/multi-actor, single/multi-action settings. Our code and models are released at https://github.com/ charliezhaoyinpeng/mule. 1.

Introduction
Open set human action recognition has been studied in recent years due to its great potential in real-world appli-cations, such as security surveillance [1], autonomous driv-ing [34], and face recognition [26]. It differs from closed set problems that aim to classify human actions into a prede-fined set of known classes, since open set methods can iden-tify samples with unseen classes with high accuracy [14].
To this end, several recent methods [4, 6, 10] are pro-posed for open set human action recognition. As shown in the bottom-left of Figure 1, they focus on single-actor, single-action based recognition, assuming that each video contains only one single action. Compared with softmax

Novelty detection examples of single/multiple actor(s) with single/multiple action(s) in video [16, 38], where an actor is identified as novel (yellow) rather than being from a known cat-egory (cyan) in inference. Existing works [4, 6] on open set ac-tion recognition focus on single actor associated with single action (bottom-left), while our method can handle different situations. thresholding [13, 22, 25] for closed set recognition, eviden-tial neural networks (ENNs) [4, 36] can provide a princi-pled way to jointly formulate the multi-class classification and uncertainty modeling to measure novelty of an instance more accurately. It assumes that class probability follows a prior Dirichlet distribution. However, in more realistic situ-ation with multiple actions of actor(s) (see the upper part of
Figure 1), the Dirichlet distribution does not hold because the predicted likelihood of each action follows a binomial distribution (i.e., identifying either known or novel action).
In this paper, we introduce a general but understudied problem, namely novelty detection of actor(s) with multi-ple actions. Given real-world use cases [14, 39], the goal is to accurately detect if actor(s) perform novel/unknown action(s) or not. Following [43], an actor is considered un-known if it does not contain any known action(s). Inspired by the belief theory [17, 45], we propose a new framework named MUlti-Label Evidential learning (MULE), which is composed of three modules: Actor-Context-Object Rela-tion modeling (ACO-R), Beta Evidential Neural Network (Beta-ENN), and Multi-label Evidence Debiasing Con-straint (M-EDC). First, we build ACO-R representation to exploit the actors’ interactions with the surrounding objects and the context. Then, we use Beta-ENN to estimate the evidence of known actions, and quantify the predictive un-certainty of actions so that unknown actions would incur
high uncertainty, i.e., lack of confidence for known predic-tions. Here, the evidence indicates actions closest to the predicted one in the feature space and are used to support the decision-making [36]. Instead of relying on Dirichlet distribution [4], the evidence in Beta-ENN is regarded as parameters of a Beta distribution which is a conjugate prior of the Binomial likelihood.
Additionally, in open set recognition, static bias [21] may bring a false correlation between the prediction and static cues, such as scenes, resulting in inferior generaliza-tion capability of a model. Therefore, the M-EDC is added to the objective function of our framework to reduce the static bias for video actions. We propose a duality-based learning algorithm to optimize the network. Specifically, we apply an averaging scheme to proximate primal opti-mal solutions. The primal and dual parameters are updated interactively, where the primal parameters regard model ac-curacy and dual parameters adjust model debiasing. The theoretical analysis shows the convergence of the primal so-lution sequence and gives bounds for both the loss function and the violation of the debiasing constraint in MULE. Ac-cording to the proposed uncertainty and belief based novelty estimation mechanisms, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on two action recognition datasets (i.e., AVA [16] and Charades [38]) in terms of novelty detection. The main contributions of this work are summarized:
• A new framework MULE is proposed for open set action recognition in videos that contains either a single or mul-tiple actors associated with one or more actions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to detect ac-tors with multiple unknown actions.
• To optimize the Beta-ENN, we develop a primal-dual av-erage scheme update algorithm, with theoretical guaran-tees on the convergence of the primal solution sequence and bounds for both the loss function and the violation of the debiasing constraint.
• We introduce four novelty estimation mechanisms to cal-culate novelty score and achieve better performance on novel action detection compared with existing methods. 2.
