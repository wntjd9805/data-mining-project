Abstract
We introduce a light steering technology that operates at megahertz frequencies, has no moving parts, and costs less than a hundred dollars. Our technology can benefit many projector and imaging systems that critically rely on high-speed, reliable, low-cost, and wavelength-independent light steering, including laser scanning projectors, LiDAR sensors, and fluorescence microscopes. Our technology uses ultrasound waves to generate a spatiotemporally-varying refractive index field inside a compressible medium, such as water, turning the medium into a dynamic traveling lens. By controlling the electrical input of the ultrasound transducers that generate the waves, we can change the lens, and thus steer light, at the speed of sound (1.5 km/s in water). We build a physical prototype of this technology, use it to real-ize different scanning techniques at megahertz rates (three orders of magnitude faster than commercial alternatives such as galvo mirror scanners), and demonstrate proof-of-concept projector and LiDAR applications. To encourage further innovation towards this new technology, we derive theory for its fundamental limits and develop a physically-accurate simulator for virtual design. Our technology offers a promising solution for achieving high-speed and low-cost light steering in a variety of applications. 1.

Introduction
Many imaging systems rely on the ability to steer light, either as it leaves a source or as it reaches a sensor. Exam-ples include laser scanning projectors [28, 56], LiDAR depth sensors [38, 74, 75], and microscopy techniques (confocal microscopy [23, 50], light-sheet microscopy [55, 68], multi-photon microscopy [17, 82]). Compared to full-field light-ing and imaging, light steering systems help improve light efficiency [47], counter indirect illumination [27, 42], and enhance illumination and imaging contrast [9, 55]. However, these advantages come at the cost of reduced acquisition speed, bulky moving hardware, and motion artifacts. To alleviate these costs, we introduce a new light steering tech-nology that, through the use of ultrasonic sculpting, makes it possible to scan light both transversally and axially at mega-hertz (MHz) rates. Additionally, our technology achieves these high scanning rates without any moving parts. Lastly, prototypes of our technology cost no more than a hundred dollars. Altogether, these characteristics represent significant

LiDAR systems and laser projectors have moving mechanical com-ponents, limiting them to kHz scanning rates.

The insets show that, before galvo mirrors could scan even a few points, our prototype scanned a thousand points to project the letter “A” on the wall. advances over previous light steering technologies (Table 1).
Our technology uses the acousto-optic effect1 to turn a transparent medium, such as water, into a programmable optic that steers an incident light beam. Sound is a pressure wave that travels inside a medium by compressing and rar-efying it, spatiotemporally changing the medium density. In turn, this changes the refractive index of the medium, which is proportional to the density [63,79]. We design the pressure profile of the sound wave so that, at any time instant, the spatially-varying refractive index makes the medium behave as a periodic set of virtual gradient-index (GRIN) lenses, each with an aperture equal to the sound wavelength. The
GRIN lenses bend light beams incident on the medium, with the GRIN profile determining the beam trajectory. These lenses travel at the speed of sound (1.5 km/s in water) and are reconfigurable at MHz frequencies, allowing us to steer light faster than mechanical devices. To enable flexible steering 1This is different from Bragg’s diffraction in acousto-optic deflectors.
patterns, we combine this optic with a pulsed laser with a programmable pulse rate. By synchronizing the laser source with the sound waveform, and modulating the phase of the sound waveform, we control both the speed of beam steering and the location of the beam.
In Sections 3 and 4, we explain the physical and math-ematical details of our technology. We introduce a new design that uses two linear transducers to generate traveling acoustic waves, and discuss how different synchronization choices between ultrasound and pulsed laser result in differ-ent scanning patterns. To facilitate the exploration of design parameters (ultrasound speed and frequency, laser frequency) and configurations (transducer geometry), we also develop a physics-based simulator for our technology. In Section 6, we also discuss the fundamental limits of our technology due to diffraction and the uncertainty principle in wave physics.
In Section 5, we experimentally demonstrate these fast programmable light steering techniques for various appli-cations. In particular, in Section 5.2, we demonstrate an arbitrary point projector that can scan arbitrary and pro-grammable light patterns. Compared to raster scanning pro-jectors, which can project billions of points per second in a grid pattern but only a few thousand arbitrary points per sec-ond, our prototype can project a million arbitrary points per second, an acceleration by three orders of magnitude. In Sec-tion 5.3, we demonstrate a LiDAR prototype that combines our light steering technology with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD). We show 3D scans of 100 × 100 resolution at 5000 frames per second (50 million points per second) with a single-pixel SPAD, which is not feasible with scanning galvo mirrors.
Contributions. Our main contributions are: 1. A new light steering technology based on the acousto-optic effect that is three orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art mechanical steering technologies. 2. A new hardware design with planar transducers gener-ating of traveling waves. 3. An experimental prototype demonstrating ultrafast arbi-trary point projection and LiDAR scanning. 4. A physics-based renderer to simulate digital twins of our prototype and evaluate different designs. 5. The derivation of limits due to fundamental restrictions from wave physics (diffraction limit, scanning speed vs. aperture tradeoff, and uncertainty principle).
We provide our open-source simulator, data, and additional details in the supplement and project website.2
Limitations. Our prototype has a diffraction-limited point spread function (PSF) with a large spatial extent and a “+” shape, due to the use of two linear transducers that create a rectangular aperture. This limits spatial resolution, and introduces structured blur artifacts. These limitations are not fundamental to our core technology, and can be overcome 2https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/ultrafast_steering
