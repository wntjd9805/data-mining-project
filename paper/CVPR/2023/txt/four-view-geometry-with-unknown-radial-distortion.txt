Abstract
We present novel solutions to previously unsolved prob-lems of relative pose estimation from images whose calibra-tion parameters, namely focal lengths and radial distortion, are unknown. Our approach enables metric reconstruction without modeling these parameters. The minimal case for reconstruction requires 13 points in 4 views for both the calibrated and uncalibrated cameras. We describe and im-plement the first solution to these minimal problems. In the calibrated case, this may be modeled as a polynomial sys-tem of equations with 3584 solutions. Despite the apparent intractability, the problem decomposes spectacularly. Each solution falls into a Euclidean symmetry class of size 16, and we can estimate 224 class representatives by solving a sequence of three subproblems with 28, 2, and 4 solutions.
We highlight the relationship between internal constraints on the radial quadrifocal tensor and the relations among the principal minors of a 4 × 4 matrix. We also address the case of 4 upright cameras, where 7 points are minimal. Fi-nally, we evaluate our approach on simulated and real data and benchmark against previous calibration-free solutions, and show that our method provides an efficient startup for an SfM pipeline with radial cameras.

Introduction
Determining the relative position and orientation of two or more cameras is a classical problem in computer vi-sion [33]. It appears in the back-end of many vision sys-tems, usually to initialize SLAM [54] or further reconstruc-tion in Structure-from-Motion [70]. Much effort has been concentrated on the development of methods for 3D recon-struction using perspective cameras with various additional lens distortion models [1, 52, 70]. 1

Any type of geometric estimation usually requires know-ing the intrinsic calibration, i.e., the mapping from pix-els in the image to the directions of the incoming viewing rays. If the intrinsic parameters are unknown, so-called self-calibration [26] can be attempted where the camera extrin-sic and intrinsic calibration are jointly estimated. Histori-cally, this is done in a stratified approach where a projective reconstruction is first obtained followed by a metric upgrade step [33]. These approaches are usually limited in the com-plexity of the cameras that can be handled; often making the assumption of pure pinhole projection.
An orthogonal line of work aims to recover camera ex-trinsics without estimating intrinsics. Assuming that the camera is radially symmetric (unit aspect ratio and distor-tion that only varies radially), it is possible to extract geo-metric constraints on camera poses that are invariant to fo-cal length or radial distortion. The idea, first introduced by Tsai [78], is to only consider the angle and ignore the radius for each projection, essentially projecting 3D points onto radial lines in the image. Enforcing that the radial line pass through the 2D keypoint then yields a geometric con-straint on both the 3D point and the camera pose (excluding the pure forward translation). In this context, the camera (mapping from 3D point to radial line) is referred to as a 1D radial camera [47, 76]. Mathematically, this gives a per-spective camera from P3 to P1, illustrated in Figure 1.
Radial cameras bring an important alternative to classi-cal uncalibrated (radially distorted) pinhole cameras. With radial cameras, we can completely avoid (auto-)calibrating complicated radial distortion models (and focal lengths) of all cameras involved, just by using 4 instead of 2 cameras in 3D reconstruction initialization. 1.2. Contribution
Motivated by the 1D radial construction above, we study problems from the multi-view geometry of P3 (cid:57)(cid:57)(cid:75) P1 cam-eras. In particular, we consider problems containing four images (the minimum number where constraints can be ob-tained in a general configuration). Solving these problems allows us to effectively perform metric reconstruction for cameras with unknown radial distortion under very weak assumptions on the distortion, namely that it is radially sym-metric and centered in the image.
We provide three main technical contributions. First, we formulate 13-point calibrated minimal problem for 4 ra-dial cameras and, guided by computational Galois theory, show that this (seemingly) hard problem with 3584 com-plex solutions decomposes into subproblems with 28, 2, and 4 solutions, among which the minimal case for uncal-ibrated cameras also appears. We present a parallel study for the 7-point minimal problem for upright radial cam-eras. Secondly, we present the internal constraints on the 2 Uncalibrated Linear [34]

Finally, based on the pre-vious theoretical contributions, we design and implement stable and practical (78 & 18 ms runtime) Homotopy Con-tinuation (HC) minimal solvers and show their quality in simulated and real experiments. We show that our solvers provide efficient initialization of the radial camera 3D re-construction pipeline [47]. This provides previously miss-ing piece for building an efficient radial camera 3D recon-struction pipelines. 2.
