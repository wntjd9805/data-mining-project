Abstract
Point cloud classiﬁcation is an essential component in many security-critical applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, point cloud classi-ﬁers are vulnerable to adversarially perturbed point clouds.
Existing certiﬁed defenses against adversarial point clouds suffer from a key limitation: their certiﬁed robustness guar-antees are probabilistic, i.e., they produce an incorrect cer-tiﬁed robustness guarantee with some probability. In this work, we propose a general framework, namely PointCert, that can transform an arbitrary point cloud classiﬁer to be certiﬁably robust against adversarial point clouds with de-terministic guarantees. PointCert certiﬁably predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modiﬁed points is less than a thresh-old. Moreover, we propose multiple methods to optimize the certiﬁed robustness guarantees of PointCert in three appli-cation scenarios. We systematically evaluate PointCert on
ModelNet and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets. Our re-sults show that PointCert substantially outperforms state-of-the-art certiﬁed defenses even though their robustness guarantees are probabilistic. 1.

Introduction
Point cloud classiﬁcation [11,29,30,38,44,50] has many safety-critical applications, including but not limited to, au-tonomous driving and augmented reality. However, vari-ous studies [12, 16, 22, 32, 40, 43, 46, 51, 52] showed that point cloud classiﬁcation is vulnerable to adversarial point clouds. In particular, an attacker can carefully add, delete, and/or modify a small number of points in a point cloud to make it misclassiﬁed by a point cloud classiﬁer.
Existing defenses against adversarial point clouds can be categorized into empirical defenses [7, 21, 33, 41, 46, 49, 53] and certiﬁed defenses [5, 6, 23]. The key limitation of em-pirical defenses is that they cannot provide formal guaran-tees, and thus are often broken by advanced, adaptive at-tacks [34]. Therefore, we focus on certiﬁed defenses in this work. Randomized smoothing [5] and PointGuard [23] are two state-of-the-art certiﬁed defenses against adversar-ial point clouds. In particular, randomized smoothing adds random noise (e.g., Gaussian noise) to a point cloud, while
PointGuard randomly subsamples a point cloud. Due to the randomness, their certiﬁed robustness guarantees are prob-abilistic, i.e., they produce incorrect robustness guarantees with some probability (called error probability). For in-stance, when the error probability is 0.001, they produce in-correct robustness guarantees for 1 out of 1,000 point-cloud classiﬁcations on average. Such probabilistic guarantees are insufﬁcient for security-critical applications that frequently classify point clouds.
In this work, we propose PointCert, the ﬁrst certiﬁed de-fense that has deterministic robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds. PointCert can transform an arbi-trary point cloud classiﬁer f (called base point cloud classi-ﬁer) to be certiﬁably robust against adversarial point clouds.
Speciﬁcally, given a point cloud and a base point cloud clas-siﬁer f , PointCert ﬁrst divides the point cloud into multiple disjoint sub-point clouds using a hash function, then uses f to predict a label for each sub-point cloud, and ﬁnally takes a majority vote among the predicted labels as the predicted label for the original point cloud. We prove that PointCert certiﬁably predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modiﬁed points is no larger than a threshold, which is known as certiﬁed perturbation size. Moreover, we also prove that our derived certiﬁed perturbation size is tight, i.e., without making as-sumptions on the base point cloud classiﬁer f , it is theoret-ically impossible to derive a certiﬁed perturbation size for
PointCert that is larger than ours.
We consider three scenarios about how PointCert could be applied in practice and propose methods to optimize the performance of PointCert in these scenarios. In particular, we consider two parties: model provider and customer. A model provider (e.g., Google, Meta) has enough labeled
data and computation resource to train a base point cloud classiﬁer f and shares it with customers (e.g., a less re-sourceful company). Given f , a customer uses PointCert to classify its (adversarial) point clouds. We note that the model provider and customer can be the same entity, e.g., a company trains and uses f itself. We consider three scenar-ios, in which f is trained by the model provider differently and/or used by a customer differently.
Scenario I represents a naive application of PointCert, in which the base point cloud classiﬁer f is trained using a standard training algorithm and a customer directly applies
PointCert to classify its point clouds based on f . PointCert achieves suboptimal performance in Scenario I because f , trained on point clouds, is not accurate at classifying sub-point clouds as they have different distributions. Therefore, in Scenario II, we consider a model provider trains f to optimize the performance of PointCert.
In particular, the model provider divides each training point cloud into multi-ple sub-point clouds following PointCert and trains f based on sub-point clouds. In Scenario III, we consider the model provider has trained f using a standard training algorithm (like Scenario I). However, instead of directly applying f to classify sub-point clouds, a customer prepends a Point Com-pletion Network (PCN) [48] to f . Speciﬁcally, a PCN takes a sub-point cloud as input and outputs a completed point cloud, which is then classiﬁed by f . Moreover, we propose a new loss function to train the PCN such that its completed point clouds are classiﬁed by f with higher accuracy, which further improves the performance of PointCert.
We perform systematic evaluation on ModelNet40 dataset [1] and two variants of ScanObjectNN dataset [2].
Our experimental results show that PointCert signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art certiﬁed defenses (random-ized smoothing [5] and PointGuard [23]) even though their robustness guarantees are probabilistic. For instance, on
ModelNet40 dataset, PointCert achieves a certiﬁed accu-racy of 79% when an attacker can arbitrarily perturb at most 50 points in a point cloud, where certiﬁed accuracy is a lower bound of testing accuracy. Under the same setting, the certiﬁed accuracy of both randomized smoothing and
PointGuard is 0. We also extensively evaluate PointCert in the three application scenarios.
In summary, we make the following contributions: (1)
We propose PointCert, the ﬁrst certiﬁed defense with de-terministic robustness guarantees against adversarial point clouds. (2) We design multiple methods to optimize the performance of PointCert in multiple application scenarios. (3) We extensively evaluate PointCert and compare it with state-of-the-art certiﬁed defenses. 2.
