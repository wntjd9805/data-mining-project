Abstract
Semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical task in the intelligent surveillance system. How-ever, an essential type of anomaly in VAD named scene-dependent anomaly has not received the attention of re-searchers. Moreover, there is no research investigating anomaly anticipation, a more significant task for preventing the occurrence of anomalous events. To this end, we pro-pose a new comprehensive dataset, NWPU Campus, con-taining 43 scenes, 28 classes of abnormal events, and 16 hours of videos. At present, it is the largest semi-supervised
VAD dataset with the largest number of scenes and classes of anomalies, the longest duration, and the only one con-sidering the scene-dependent anomaly. Meanwhile, it is also the first dataset proposed for video anomaly antici-pation. We further propose a novel model capable of de-tecting and anticipating anomalous events simultaneously.
Compared with 7 outstanding VAD algorithms in recent years, our method can cope with scene-dependent anomaly detection and anomaly anticipation both well, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ShanghaiTech, CUHK Av-enue, IITB Corridor and the newly proposed NWPU Cam-pus datasets consistently. Our dataset and code is available at: https://campusvad.github.io. 1.

Introduction
Video anomaly detection (VAD) is widely applied in public safety and intelligent surveillance due to its ability to detect unexpected abnormal events in videos. Since anoma-lous events are characterized by unbounded categories and rare occurrence in practice, VAD is commonly set as a semi-supervised task, that is, there are only normal events without specific labels in the training set [1, 2]. The model trained only on the normal events needs to distinguish anomalous events from normal events in the testing phase.
Semi-supervised VAD has been studied for years. Espe-†Corresponding author cially in recent years, reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods [3–21] have made leaps and bounds in per-formance on existing datasets. For example, the frame-level AUCs (area under curve) on UCSD Ped1 and Ped2 datasets [22] have reached over 97% [2]. Despite the emer-gence of a few challenging datasets, researchers still over-look an important type of anomaly, i.e., the scene-dependent anomaly [2]. Scene dependency refers to that an event is normal in one scene but abnormal in another. For example, playing football on the playground is a normal behavior, but playing on the road is abnormal. Note that single-scene datasets cannot contain any scene-dependent anomaly. Nev-ertheless, the existing multi-scene datasets (e.g., Shang-haiTech [23], UBnormal [24]) also have not taken this type of anomaly into account. As a result, there is currently no algorithm for studying scene-dependent anomaly detection, limiting the comprehensive evaluation of VAD algorithms.
In addition to detecting various types of anomalies, we ar-gue that there is another task that also deserves the attention of researchers, which is to anticipate the occurrence of ab-normal events in advance. If we can make an early warning before the anomalous event occurs based on the trend of the event, it is of great significance to prevent dangerous accidents and avoid loss of life and property. However, ac-cording to our investigation, there is no research on video anomaly anticipation, and no dataset or algorithm has been proposed for this field.
In this paper, we work on semi-supervised video anomaly detection and anticipation. First and foremost, to address the issue that the VAD datasets lack scene-dependent anomalies and are not suitable for anomaly an-ticipation, we propose a new large-scale dataset, NWPU
Campus. Compared with existing datasets, our proposed dataset mainly has the following three advantages. First, to the best of our knowledge, the NWPU Campus is the largest semi-supervised VAD dataset to date.
It contains 43 scenes, whose number is 3 times that of ShanghaiTech, the real recorded dataset with the largest number of scenes among the existing datasets. The total video duration of the
NWPU Campus is 16 hours, which is more than 3 times that

Corridor [29]. The quantitative comparison between the
NWPU Campus and other datasets can be seen in Tab. 1.
Second, the NWPU Campus has a variety of abnormal and normal events. In terms of anomalies, it contains 28 classes of anomalous events, which is more than any other dataset.
Fig. 1 displays some examples from our dataset. More importantly, the NWPU Campus dataset contains scene-dependent anomalous events, which are missing in other datasets. As an example, the behavior of a vehicle turning left is anomalous in the scene where left turns are prohib-ited, while it is normal in other unrestricted scenes. Along with the diversity of anomalous events, the normal events in our dataset are diverse as well. Unlike other datasets, we do not only take walking and standing as normal be-haviors.
In our dataset, regular walking, cycling, driving and other daily behaviors that obey rules are also consid-ered as normal events. Third, in addition to being served as a video anomaly detection benchmark, the NWPU Campus is the first dataset proposed for video anomaly anticipation (VAA). The existing datasets do not deliberately consider the anomalous events applicable to anticipation. In contrast, we take into account the complete process of the events in the data collection phase so that the occurrence of abnormal events is predictable. For instance, before the vehicle turns left (the scene-dependent anomalous event as mentioned be-fore), the movement trend of it can be observed, and hence the algorithm could make an early warning. As a compari-son, it is considered to be abnormal when a vehicle simply appears in the ShanghaiTech dataset, which is unpredictable and therefore not suitable for anomaly anticipation.
Besides comprehensive benchmarks, there is currently a lack of algorithms for scene-dependent anomaly detection and video anomaly anticipation. Therefore, in this work, we further propose a novel forward-backward frame prediction model that can detect anomalies and simultaneously antici-pate whether an anomalous event is likely to occur in the fu-ture. Moreover, it has the ability to handle scene-dependent anomalies through the proposed scene-conditioned auto-encoder. As a result, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShanghaiTech [23], CUHK Avenue [27],
IITB Corridor [29], and our NWPU Campus datasets.
In summary, our contribution is threefold:
• We propose a new dataset NWPU Campus, which is the largest and most complex semi-supervised video anomaly detection benchmark to date. It makes up for the lack of scene-dependent anomalies in the current research field.
• We propose a new video anomaly anticipation task to anticipate the occurrence of anomalous events in ad-vance, and the NWPU Campus is also the first dataset proposed for anomaly anticipation, filling the research gap in this area.
• We propose a novel method to detect and anticipate anomalous events simultaneously, and it can cope with scene-dependent anomalies. Comparisons with 7 state-of-the-art VAD methods on the NWPU Cam-pus, ShanghaiTech, CUHK Avenue and IITB Corridor datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. 2.
