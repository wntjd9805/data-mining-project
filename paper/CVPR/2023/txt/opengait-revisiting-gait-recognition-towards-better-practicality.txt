Abstract
Gait recognition is one of the most critical long-distance identification technologies and increasingly gains popular-ity in both research and industry communities. Despite the significant progress made in indoor datasets, much evidence shows that gait recognition techniques perform poorly in the wild. More importantly, we also find that some con-clusions drawn from indoor datasets cannot be generalized to real applications. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive benchmark study for better practicality rather than only a particular model for better performance. To this end, we first develop a flexible and efficient gait recognition codebase named OpenGait.
Based on OpenGait, we deeply revisit the recent develop-ment of gait recognition by re-conducting the ablative ex-periments. Encouragingly,we detect some unperfect parts of certain prior woks, as well as new insights. Inspired by these discoveries, we develop a structurally simple, empiri-cally powerful, and practically robust baseline model, Gait-Base. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare Gait-Base with many current gait recognition methods on mul-tiple public datasets, and the results reflect that GaitBase achieves significantly strong performance in most cases re-gardless of indoor or outdoor situations.

Introduction
Gait recognition has recently gained growing interest from the vision research community. It utilizes the physi-ological and behavioral characteristics from walking videos to authenticate individualsâ€™s identities [34]. Compared with other biometrics, e.g., face, fingerprint, and iris, gait pat-terns can be captured from a distance in uncontrolled set-tings, without requiring any physical contact. As a walking

The left two are indoor datasets [32, 38], the right two are outdoor datasets [41, 43]. behavior, gait is also hard to disguise and thus promisingly robust for usual subject-related covariates, such as dress-ing, carrying, and standing conditions. These advantages make gait recognition suitable for public security applica-tions, e.g., criminal investigation, and suspect tracking [35].
With the boom of deep learning, gait recognition in the laboratory [32, 38] has achieved significant progress [2, 5, 18] over the last decade. However, much evidence [41, 43] reveal that gait recognition techniques may not perform op-timally in the wild. As shown in Figure 1, most existing gait recognition methods suffer an over 40% accuracy degra-dation when transitioning from indoor to outdoor datasets.
Typically, this performance gap should be mainly caused by real-world noisy factors, such as complex occlusion, back-ground variation, and illumination changes.
Nevertheless, our further ablative study shows that this situation is not unique, as many of the conclusions drawn
in prior works vary with different datasets. Therefore, be-sides proposing an improved model for better performance, the primary objective of this paper is to present a compre-hensive benchmark study to revisit gait recognition for en-hanced practicality. To this end, we make efforts in the fol-lowing three aspects.
Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, previous works mainly develop the models on their code repository and rely heavily on the indoor gait datasets, particularly CASIA-B [38] and OU-MVLP [32]. To accelerate the real-world applications, we appeal to pay more attention to outdoor gait datasets, such as GREW [43] and Gait3D [41]. Addi-tionally, this paper also considers building a unified eval-uation platform, which covers the various state-of-the-art methods and testing datasets, is highly desired. Accord-ingly, we propose a flexible and efficient gait recognition codebase with PyTorch [24] and name it OpenGait.
To ensure extensibility and reusability, OpenGait sup-(1) Various datasets, e.g., ports the following features: the indoor CASIA-B [38] and OU-MVLP [32], the outdoor

GREW [43]. Encouragingly, all of the top-10 winning teams at HID2022 [37] have utilized OpenGait as their codebase and extended OpenGait to develop new solutions.
Based on OpenGait, we reproduce many progressive methods [2, 5, 18], and the results have been shown in Fig-ure 1. More importantly, we conduct a comprehensive re-evaluation of various commonly accepted conclusions by re-implementing the ablation study on recently-built out-door gait datasets. To our surprise, we find that the MGP branch proposed by GaitSet [2], the FConv proposed by
GaitPart [5], the local feature extraction branch proposed by GaitGL [18], and the SMPL branch proposed by SMPL-Gait [41], do not exhibit superiority on the outdoor datasets.
Moreover, our thorough exploration of potential causes re-veals several hidden limitations of prior gait research, such as the lack of comprehensive ablation study, outdoor dataset evaluation, and a strong backbone network.
Inspired by the above discoveries, we develop a simple yet strong baseline model, named GaitBase. Specifically,
GaitBase is composed of several essential parts, some of which are simple and commonly utilized rather than in-tricately constructed modules. Even no bells or whistles,
GaitBase can achieve comparable or even superior perfor-mance on indoor gait datasets. As to the datasets in the wild, GaitBase outperforms recently proposed methods and 1HID 2023: https://hid2023.iapr-tc4.org reaches a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we also con-duct a comprehensive study to verify that GaitBase is a structurally simple, experimentally powerful, and empiri-cally robust baseline model for gait recognition.
In summary, this paper contributes future works from three aspects: (1) OpenGait, a unified and extensible plat-form, is built to facilitate the comprehensive study of gait recognition. (2) We deeply revisit the recent gait recog-nition developments and consequently bring many new in-sights for further gait recognition research. (3) We provide a structurally simple and experimentally powerful baseline model, GaitBase, which can inspire the future design of gait recognition algorithms. We hope the works in the paper can inspire researchers to develop more advanced gait recogni-tion methods for real-world applications. 2.
