In this paper, we consider a highly general image recog-nition setting wherein, given a labelled and unlabelled set of images, the task is to categorize all images in the un-labelled set. Here, the unlabelled images may come from labelled classes or from novel ones. Existing recognition methods are not able to deal with this setting, because they make several restrictive assumptions, such as the un-labelled instances only coming from known – or unknown – classes, and the number of unknown classes being known a-priori. We address the more unconstrained setting, nam-ing it ‘Generalized Category Discovery’, and challenge all these assumptions. We ﬁrst establish strong baselines by taking state-of-the-art algorithms from novel category dis-covery and adapting them for this task. Next, we pro-pose the use of vision transformers with contrastive rep-resentation learning for this open-world setting. We then introduce a simple yet effective semi-supervised k-means method to cluster the unlabelled data into seen and un-seen classes automatically, substantially outperforming the baselines. Finally, we also propose a new approach to esti-mate the number of classes in the unlabelled data. We thor-oughly evaluate our approach on public datasets for generic object classiﬁcation and on ﬁne-grained datasets, lever-aging the recent Semantic Shift Benchmark suite.
