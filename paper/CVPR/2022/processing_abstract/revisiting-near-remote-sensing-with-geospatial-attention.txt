This work addresses the task of overhead image segmen-tation when auxiliary ground-level images are available.Recent work has shown that performing joint inference over these two modalities, often called near/remote sensing, can yield significant accuracy improvements. Extending this line of work, we introduce the concept of geospatial atten-tion, a geometry-aware attention mechanism that explicitly considers the geospatial relationship between the pixels in a ground-level image and a geographic location. We propose an approach for computing geospatial attention that incor-porates geometric features and the appearance of the over-head and ground-level imagery. We introduce a novel ar-chitecture for near/remote sensing that is based on geospa-tial attention and demonstrate its use for five segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods.
