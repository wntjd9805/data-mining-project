Less than 35% of recyclable waste is being actually re-cycled in the US [2], which leads to increased soil and sea pollution and is one of the major concerns of envi-ronmental researchers as well as the common public. At the heart of the problem are the inefﬁciencies of the waste sorting process (separating paper, plastic, metal, glass, etc.) due to the extremely complex and cluttered nature of the waste stream. Recyclable waste detection poses a unique computer vision challenge as it requires detection of highly deformable and often translucent objects in clut-tered scenes without the kind of context information usually present in human-centric datasets. This challenging com-puter vision task currently lacks suitable datasets or meth-ods in the available literature.In this paper, we take a step towards computer-aided waste detection and present the ﬁrst in-the-wild industrial-grade waste detection and segmentation dataset, ZeroWaste. We believe that Ze-roWaste will catalyze research in object detection and semantic segmentation in extreme clutter as well as appli-cations in the recycling domain.
