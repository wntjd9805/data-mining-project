Adversary and invisibility are two fundamental but con-flict characters of adversarial perturbations. Previous ad-versarial attacks on 3D point cloud recognition have of-ten been criticized for their noticeable point outliers, since they just involve an “implicit constrain” like global dis-tance loss in the time-consuming optimization to limit the generated noise. While point cloud is a highly structured data format, it is hard to constrain its perturbation with a simple loss or metric properly.In this paper, we pro-pose a novel Point-Cloud Sensitivity Map to boost both the efficiency and imperceptibility of point perturbations.This map reveals the vulnerability of point cloud recogni-tion models when encountering shape-invariant adversarial noises. These noises are designed along the shape surface with an “explicit constrain” instead of extra distance loss.Specifically, we first apply a reversible coordinate transfor-mation on each point of the point cloud input, to reduce one degree of point freedom and limit its movement on the tan-gent plane. Then we calculate the best attacking direction with the gradients of the transformed point cloud obtained on the white-box model. Finally we assign each point with a non-negative score to construct the sensitivity map, which benefits both white-box adversarial invisibility and black-box query-efficiency extended in our work. Extensive evalu-ations prove that our method can achieve the superior per-formance on various point cloud recognition models, with its satisfying adversarial imperceptibility and strong resis-tance to different point cloud defense settings.
