Although the Trajectory Prediction (TP) model has achieved great success in computer vision and roboticsﬁelds, its architecture and training scheme design rely on heavy manual work and domain knowledge, which is not friendly to common users. Besides, the existing works ig-nore Federated Learning (FL) scenarios, failing to make full use of distributed multi-source datasets with rich ac-tual scenes to learn more a powerful TP model. In this pa-per, we make up for the above defects and propose ATPFL to help users federate multi-source trajectory datasets to automatically design and train a powerful TP model.InATPFL, we build an effective TP search space by analyz-ing and summarizing the existing works. Then, based on the characters of this search space, we design a relation-sequence-aware search strategy, realizing the automatic de-sign of the TP model. Finally, we ﬁnd appropriate feder-ated training methods to respectively support the TP model search and ﬁnal model training under the FL framework, ensuring both the search efﬁciency and the ﬁnal model per-formance. Extensive experimental results show that ATPFL can help users gain well-performed TP models, achieving better results than the existing TP models trained on the single-source dataset.
