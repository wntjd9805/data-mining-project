Color constancy is an essential function in digital pho-tography and a fundamental process for many computer vi-sion applications. Accordingly, many methods have been proposed, and some recent ones have used deep neural net-works to handle more complex scenarios. However, both the traditional and latest methods still impose strict assump-tions on their target scenes in explicit or implicit ways. This paper shows that the degree of linear polarization dramat-ically solves the color constancy problem because it allows us to find achromatic pixels stably. Because we only rely on the physics-based polarization model, we significantly reduce the assumptions compared to existing methods. Fur-thermore, we captured a wide variety of scenes with ground-truth illuminations for evaluation, and the proposed ap-proach achieved state-of-the-art performance with a low computational cost. Additionally, the proposed method can estimate illumination colors from chromatic pixels and manage multi-illumination scenes. Lastly, the evaluation scenes and codes are publicly available to encourage more development in this field.
