Contour-based instance segmentation methods have de-veloped rapidly recently but feature rough and hand-crafted front-end contour initialization, which restricts the model performance, and an empirical and ﬁxed backend predicted-label vertex pairing, which contributes to the learning difﬁculty.In this paper, we introduce a novel contour-based method, named E2EC, for high-quality in-stance segmentation. Firstly, E2EC applies a novel learn-able contour initialization architecture instead of hand-This consists of a con-crafted contour initialization. tour initialization module for constructing more explicit learning goals and a global contour deformation module for taking advantage of all of the vertices’ features bet-ter. Secondly, we propose a novel label sampling scheme, named multi-direction alignment, to reduce the learning dif-ﬁculty. Thirdly, to improve the quality of the boundary de-tails, we dynamically match the most appropriate predicted-ground truth vertex pairs and propose the corresponding loss function named dynamic matching loss. The experi-ments showed that E2EC can achieve a state-of-the-art per-formance on the KITTI INStance (KINS) dataset, the Se-mantic Boundaries Dataset (SBD), the Cityscapes and theCOCO dataset. E2EC is also efﬁcient for use in real-time applications, with an inference speed of 36 fps for 512×512 images on an NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Code will be released at https://github.com/zhang-tao-whu/e2ec.
