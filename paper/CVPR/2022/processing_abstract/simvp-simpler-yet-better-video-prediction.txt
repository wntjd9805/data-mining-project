From CNN, RNN, to ViT, we have witnessed remarkable advancements in video prediction, incorporating auxiliary inputs, elaborate neural architectures, and sophisticated training strategies. We admire these progresses but are con-fused about the necessity: is there a simple method that can perform comparably well? This paper proposes SimVP, a simple video prediction model that is completely built uponCNN and trained by MSE loss in an end-to-end fashion.Without introducing any additional tricks and complicated strategies, we can achieve state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets. Through extended experiments, we demonstrate that SimVP has strong generalization and ex-tensibility on real-world datasets. The significant reduction of training cost makes it easier to scale to complex scenar-ios. We believe SimVP can serve as a solid baseline to stim-ulate the further development of video prediction.
