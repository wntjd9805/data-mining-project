Denoising and demosaicking are two essential steps to reconstruct a clean full-color image from the raw data. Re-cently, joint denoising and demosaicking (JDD) for burst images, namely JDD-B, has attracted much attention by us-ing multiple raw images captured in a short time to recon-struct a single high-quality image. One key challenge ofJDD-B lies in the robust alignment of image frames. State-of-the-art alignment methods in feature domain cannot ef-fectively utilize the temporal information of burst images, where large shifts commonly exist due to camera and ob-ject motion.In addition, the higher resolution (e.g., 4K) of modern imaging devices results in larger displacement between frames. To address these challenges, we design a differentiable two-stage alignment scheme sequentially in patch and pixel level for effective JDD-B. The input burst images are firstly aligned in the patch level by using a dif-ferentiable progressive block matching method, which can estimate the offset between distant frames with small com-putational cost. Then we perform implicit pixel-wise align-ment in full-resolution feature domain to refine the align-ment results. The two stages are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the signifi-cant improvement of our method over existing JDD-B meth-ods. Codes are available at https://github.com/GuoShi28/2StageAlign.
