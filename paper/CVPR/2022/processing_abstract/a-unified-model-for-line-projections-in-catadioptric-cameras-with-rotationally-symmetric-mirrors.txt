Lines are among the most used computer vision features, in applications such as camera calibration to object de-tection. Catadioptric cameras with rotationally symmetric mirrors are omnidirectional imaging devices, capturing up to a 360 degrees field of view. These are used in many ap-plications ranging from robotics to panoramic vision. Al-though known for some specific configurations, the mod-eling of line projection was never fully solved for general central and non-central catadioptric cameras. We start by taking some general point reflection assumptions and de-rive a line reflection constraint. This constraint is then used to define a line projection into the image. Next, we com-pare our model with previous methods, showing that our general approach outputs the same polynomial degrees as previous configuration-specific systems. We run several ex-periments using synthetic and real-world data, validating our line projection model. Lastly, we show an application of our methods to an absolute camera pose problem.
