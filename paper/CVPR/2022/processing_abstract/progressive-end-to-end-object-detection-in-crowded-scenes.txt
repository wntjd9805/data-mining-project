In this paper, we propose a new query-based detec-tion framework for crowd detection. Previous query-based detectors suffer from two drawbacks: first, multiple pre-dictions will be inferred for a single object, typically in crowded scenes; second, the performance saturates as the depth of the decoding stage increases. Benefiting from the nature of the one-to-one label assignment rule, we propose a progressive predicting method to address the above is-sues. Specifically, we first select accepted queries prone to generate true positive predictions, then refine the rest noisy queries according to the previously accepted pre-dictions. Experiments show that our method can signifi-cantly boost the performance of query-based detectors in crowded scenes. Equipped with our approach, SparseRCNN achieves 92.0% AP, 41.4% MRâˆ’2 and 83.2% JI on the challenging CrowdHuman [35] dataset, outperforming the box-based method MIP [8] that specifies in handling crowded scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method, robust to crowdedness, can still obtain consistent improvements on moderately and slightly crowded datasets like CityPer-sons [47] and COCO [26].
