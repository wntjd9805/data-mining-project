This paper concerns the problem of multi-object track-ing based on the min-cost ï¬‚ow (MCF) formulation, which is conventionally studied as an instance of linear program.Given its computationally tractable inference, the success of MCF tracking largely relies on the learned cost func-tion of underlying linear program. Most previous studies focus on learning the cost function by only taking into ac-count two frames during training, therefore the learned cost function is sub-optimal for MCF where a multi-frame data association must be considered during inference. In order to address this problem, in this paper we propose a novel differentiable framework that ties training and inference to-gether during learning by solving a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower-level solves a linear program and the upper-level contains a loss function that incorpo-rates global tracking result. By back-propagating the loss through differentiable layers via gradient descent, the glob-ally parameterized cost function is explicitly learned and regularized. With this approach, we are able to learn a better objective for global MCF tracking. As a result, we achieve competitive performances compared to the current state-of-the-art methods on the popular multi-object track-ing benchmarks such as MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20.
