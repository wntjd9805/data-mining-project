Body reshaping is an important procedure in portrait photo retouching. Due to the complicated structure and multifarious appearance of human bodies, existing meth-ods either fall back on the 3D domain via body morphable model or resort to keypoint-based image deformation, lead-ing to inefficiency and unsatisfied visual quality.In this paper, we address these limitations by formulating an end-to-end flow generation architecture under the guidance of body structural priors, including skeletons and Part Affin-ity Fields, and achieve unprecedentedly controllable per-formance under arbitrary poses and garments. A composi-tional attention mechanism is introduced for capturing both visual perceptual correlations and structural associations of the human body to reinforce the manipulation consis-tency among related parts. For a comprehensive evaluation, we construct the first large-scale body reshaping dataset, namely BR-5K, which contains 5,000 portrait photos as well as professionally retouched targets. Extensive exper-iments demonstrate that our approach significantly outper-forms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual performance, controllability, and efficiency.
