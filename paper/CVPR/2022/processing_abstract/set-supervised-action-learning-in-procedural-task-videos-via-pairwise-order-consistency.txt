We address the problem of set-supervised action learn-ing, whose goal is to learn an action segmentation model using weak supervision in the form of sets of actions occur-ring in training videos. Our key observation is that videos within the same task have similar ordering of actions, which can be leveraged for effective learning. Therefore, we pro-pose an attention-based method with a new Pairwise Order-ing Consistency (POC) loss that encourages that for each common action pair in two videos of the same task, the at-tentions of actions follow a similar ordering. Unlike ex-isting sequence alignment methods, which misalign actions in videos with different orderings or cannot reliably sep-arate more from less consistent orderings, our POC loss efﬁciently aligns videos with different action orders and is differentiable, which enables end-to-end training. In addi-tion, it avoids the time-consuming pseudo-label generation of prior works. Our method efﬁciently learns the actions and their temporal locations, therefore, extends the existing attention-based action localization methods from learning one action per video to multiple actions using our POC loss along with video-level and frame-level losses. By experi-ments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method signiﬁcantly improves the state of the art. We also show that our method, with a small modiﬁcation, can effectively ad-dress the transcript-supervised action learning task, where actions and their ordering are available during training.1
