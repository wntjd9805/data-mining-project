Few-shot semantic segmentation intends to predict pixel-level categories using only a few labeled samples. Existing few-shot methods focus primarily on the categories sampled from the same distribution. Nevertheless, this assumption cannot always be ensured. The actual domain shift problem significantly reduces the performance of few-shot learning.To remedy this problem, we propose an interesting and chal-lenging cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation task, where the training and test tasks perform on different do-mains. Specifically, we first propose a meta-memory bank to improve the generalization of the segmentation network by bridging the domain gap between source and target do-mains. The meta-memory stores the intra-domain style in-formation from source domain instances and transfers it to target samples. Subsequently, we adopt a new contrastive learning strategy to explore the knowledge of different cat-egories during the training stage. The negative and pos-itive pairs are obtained from the proposed memory-based style augmentation. Comprehensive experiments demon-strate that our proposed method achieves promising results on cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation tasks onCOCO-20i , PASCAL-5i, FSS-1000, and SUIM datasets.
