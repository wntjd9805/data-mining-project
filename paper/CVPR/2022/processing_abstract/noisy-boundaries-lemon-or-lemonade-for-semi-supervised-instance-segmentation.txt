Current instance segmentation methods rely heavily on pixel-level annotated images. The huge cost to obtain such fully-annotated images restricts the dataset scale and limits the performance. In this paper, we formally address semi-supervised instance segmentation, where unlabeled images are employed to boost the performance. We construct a framework for semi-supervised instance segmentation by assigning pixel-level pseudo labels. Under this framework, we point out that noisy boundaries associated with pseudo labels are double-edged. We propose to exploit and re-sist them in a unified manner simultaneously: 1) To com-bat the negative effects of noisy boundaries, we propose a noise-tolerant mask head by leveraging low-resolution fea-tures. 2) To enhance the positive impacts, we introduce a boundary-preserving map for learning detailed informa-tion within boundary-relevant regions. We evaluate our ap-proach by extensive experiments. It behaves extraordinar-ily, outperforming the supervised baseline by a large mar-gin, more than 6% on Cityscapes, 7% on COCO and 4.5% on BDD100k. On Cityscapes, our method achieves com-parable performance by utilizing only 30% labeled images.
