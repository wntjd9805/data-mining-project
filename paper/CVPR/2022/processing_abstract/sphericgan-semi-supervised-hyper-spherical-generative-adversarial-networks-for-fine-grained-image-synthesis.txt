Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model-s have greatly facilitated image synthesis. However, the model performance may be degraded when applied to ﬁne-grained data, due to limited training samples and subtle distinction among categories. Different from generic GAN-s, we address the issue from a new perspective of discov-ering and utilizing the underlying structure of real data to explicitly regularize the spatial organization of latent s-pace. To reduce the dependence of generative models on la-beled data, we propose a semi-supervised hyper-sphericalGAN for class-conditional ﬁne-grained image generation, and our model is referred to as SphericGAN. By project-ing random vectors drawn from a prior distribution onto a hyper-sphere, we can model more complex distributions, while at the same time the similarity between the resulting latent vectors depends only on the angle, but not on their magnitudes. On the other hand, we also incorporate a map-ping network to map real images onto the hyper-sphere, and match latent vectors with the underlying structure of real data via real-fake cluster alignment. As a result, we ob-tain a spatially organized latent space, which is useful for capturing class-independent variation factors. The experi-mental results suggest that our SphericGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing high-ﬁdelity images with precise class semantics.
