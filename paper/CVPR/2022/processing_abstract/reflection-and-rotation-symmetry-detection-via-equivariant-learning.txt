The inherent challenge of detecting symmetries stems from arbitrary orientations of symmetry patterns; a reﬂec-tion symmetry mirrors itself against an axis with a speciﬁc orientation while a rotation symmetry matches its rotated copy with a speciﬁc orientation. Discovering such symme-try patterns from an image thus beneﬁts from an equivari-ant feature representation, which varies consistently with reﬂection and rotation of the image. In this work, we intro-duce a group-equivariant convolutional network for sym-metry detection, dubbed EquiSym, which leverages equiv-ariant feature maps with respect to a dihedral group of re-ﬂection and rotation. The proposed network is built end-to-end with dihedrally-equivariant layers and trained to out-put a spatial map for reﬂection axes or rotation centers.We also present a new dataset, DENse and DIverse symme-try (DENDI), which mitigates limitations of existing bench-marks for reﬂection and rotation symmetry detection. Ex-periments show that our method achieves the state of the arts in symmetry detection on LDRS and DENDI datasets.
