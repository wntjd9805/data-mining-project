state-of-the-art performance in real deraining.Image deraining is a typical low-level image restoration task, which aims at decomposing the rainy image into two distin-guishable layers: clean image layer and rain layer. Most of the existing learning-based deraining methods are supervis-edly trained on synthetic rainy-clean pairs. The domain gap between the synthetic and real rains makes them less gener-alized to different real rainy scenes. Moreover, the existing methods mainly utilize the property of the two layers inde-pendently, while few of them have considered the mutually exclusive relationship between the two layers. In this work, we propose a novel non-local contrastive learning (NLCL) method for unsupervised image deraining. Consequently, we not only utilize the intrinsic self-similarity property within samples, but also the mutually exclusive property between the two layers, so as to better differ the rain layer from the clean image. Speciﬁcally, the non-local self-similarity im-age layer patches as the positives are pulled together and similar rain layer patches as the negatives are pushed away.Thus the similar positive/negative samples that are close in the original space beneﬁt us to enrich more discrimina-tive representation. Apart from the self-similarity sampling strategy, we analyze how to choose an appropriate feature encoder in NLCL. Extensive experiments on different real rainy datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains
