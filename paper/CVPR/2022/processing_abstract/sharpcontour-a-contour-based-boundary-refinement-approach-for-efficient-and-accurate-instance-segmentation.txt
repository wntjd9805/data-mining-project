Excellent performance has been achieved on instance segmentation but the quality on the boundary area remains unsatisfactory, which leads to a rising attention on bound-ary refinement. For practical use, an ideal post-processing refinement scheme are required to be accurate, generic and efficient. However, most of existing approaches pro-pose pixel-wise refinement, which either introduce a mas-sive computation cost or design specifically for different backbone models. Contour-based models are efficient and generic to be incorporated with any existing segmentation methods, but they often generate over-smoothed contour and tend to fail on corner areas.In this paper, we pro-pose an efficient contour-based boundary refinement ap-proach, named SharpContour, to tackle the segmentation of boundary area. We design a novel contour evolution pro-cess together with an Instance-aware Point Classifier. Our method deforms the contour iteratively by updating offsets in a discrete manner. Differing from existing contour evo-lution methods, SharpContour estimates each offset more independently so that it predicts much sharper and accu-rate contours. Notably, our method is generic to seamlessly work with diverse existing models with a small computa-tional cost. Experiments show that SharpContour achieves competitive gains whilst preserving high efficiency.
