Pre-training with Geometric Set ConsistencyWe propose a method for self-supervised image represen-tation learning under the guidance of 3D geometric consis-tency. Our intuition is that 3D geometric consistency priors such as smooth regions and surface discontinuities may im-ply consistent semantics or object boundaries, and can act as strong cues to guide the learning of 2D image represen-tations without semantic labels. Specifically, we introduce 3D geometric consistency into a contrastive learning frame-work to enforce the feature consistency within image views.We propose to use geometric consistency sets as constraints and adapt the InfoNCE loss accordingly. We show that our learned image representations are general. By fine-tuning our pre-trained representations for various 2D image-based downstream tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on real-world indoor scene datasets, we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.
