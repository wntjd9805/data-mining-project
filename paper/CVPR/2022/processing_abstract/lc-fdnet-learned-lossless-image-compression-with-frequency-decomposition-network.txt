Recent learning-based lossless image compression meth-ods encode an image in the unit of subimages and achieve comparable performances to conventional non-learning al-gorithms. However, these methods do not consider the per-formance drop in the high-frequency region, giving equal consideration to the low and high-frequency areas.In this paper, we propose a new lossless image compression method that proceeds the encoding in a coarse-to-ﬁne man-ner to separate and process low and high-frequency regions differently. We initially compress the low-frequency compo-nents and then use them as additional input for encoding the remaining high-frequency region. The low-frequency com-ponents act as a strong prior in this case, which leads to im-proved estimation in the high-frequency area. In addition, we design the frequency decomposition process to be adap-tive to color channel, spatial location, and image charac-teristics. As a result, our method derives an image-speciﬁc optimal ratio of low/high-frequency components. Experi-ments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmark high-resolution datasets.
