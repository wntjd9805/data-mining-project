Recent advances in image editing techniques have posed serious challenges to the trustworthiness of multimedia data, which drives the research of image tampering detec-tion. In this paper, we propose ObjectFormer to detect and localize image manipulations. To capture subtle manipula-tion traces that are no longer visible in the RGB domain, we extract high-frequency features of the images and combine them with RGB features as multimodal patch embeddings.Additionally, we use a set of learnable object prototypes as mid-level representations to model the object-level con-sistencies among different regions, which are further used to refine patch embeddings to capture the patch-level con-sistencies. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and the results verify the effectiveness of the pro-posed method, outperforming state-of-the-art tampering de-tection and localization methods.
