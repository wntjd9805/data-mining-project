Establishing superior-quality correspondences in an im-age pair is pivotal to many subsequent computer vision tasks. Using Euclidean distance between correspondences to Ô¨Ånd neighbors and extract local information is a com-mon strategy in previous works. However, most such works ignore similar sparse semantics information between two given images and cannot capture local topology among cor-respondences well. Therefore, to deal with the above prob-lems, Multiple Sparse Semantics Dynamic Graph Network (MS2DG-Net) is proposed, in this paper, to predict proba-bilities of correspondences as inliers and recover camera poses. MS2DG-Net dynamically builds sparse semantics graphs based on sparse semantics similarity between two given images, to capture local topology among correspon-dences, while maintaining permutation-equivariant. Exten-sive experiments prove that MS2DG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in outlier removal and camera pose es-timation tasks on the public datasets with heavy outliers.Source code:https://github.com/changcaiyang/MS2DG-Net
