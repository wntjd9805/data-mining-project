ImageGround TruthWe present a novel self-distillation based self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SD-SSMDE) learning frame-work.In the ﬁrst step, our network is trained in a self-supervised regime on high-resolution images with the pho-tometric loss. The network is further used to generate pseudo depth labels for all the images in the training set.To improve the performance of our estimates, in the sec-ond step, we re-train the network with the scale invariant logarithmic loss supervised by pseudo labels. We resolve scale ambiguity and inter-frame scale consistency by intro-ducing an automatically computed scale in our depth la-bels. To ﬁlter out noisy depth values, we devise a ﬁltering scheme based on the 3D consistency between consecutive views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each pro-posed component and the self-supervised learning frame-work improve the quality of the depth estimation over the baseline and achieve state-of-the-art results on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets.Depth PredictionError Map] 8 1[ f l eS o d u e sPFigure 1. SD-SSMDE, our self-distillation framework for self-supervised monocular depth estimation. The teacher network (Self) trained in a self-supervised manner brings signiﬁcant im-provements over the baseline [18]. Our student model (Pseudo) is trained with pseudo labels generated with the previous model. The error is reduced, especially on the car on the right and on the entire left-hand side area of the image. In the error maps, small error is encoded with blue, while large error is encoded with red.
