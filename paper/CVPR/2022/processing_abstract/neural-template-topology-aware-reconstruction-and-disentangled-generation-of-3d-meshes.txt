This paper introduces a novel framework called DT-Net for 3D mesh reconstruction and generation via Dis-entangled Topology. Beyond previous works, we learn a topology-aware neural template specific to each input then deform the template to reconstruct a detailed mesh while preserving the learned topology. One key insight is to de-couple the complex mesh reconstruction into two sub-tasks: topology formulation and shape deformation. Thanks to the decoupling, DT-Net implicitly learns a disentangled repre-sentation for the topology and shape in the latent space.Hence, it can enable novel disentangled controls for sup-porting various shape generation applications, e.g., remix the topologies of 3D objects, that are not achievable by previous reconstruction works. Extensive experimental re-sults demonstrate that our method1 is able to produce high-quality meshes, particularly with diverse topologies, as compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
