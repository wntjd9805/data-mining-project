Automatic tooth instance segmentation on 3D dental models is a fundamental task for computer-aided orthodon-tic treatments. Existing learning-based methods rely heav-ily on expensive point-wise annotations. To alleviate this problem, we are the first to explore a low-cost annotation way for 3D tooth instance segmentation, i.e., labeling all tooth centroids and only a few teeth for each dental model.Regarding the challenge when only weak annotation is pro-vided, we present a dental arch prior-assisted 3D tooth seg-mentation method, namely DArch. Our DArch consists of two stages, including tooth centroid detection and tooth in-stance segmentation. Accurately detecting the tooth cen-troids can help locate the individual tooth, thus benefiting the segmentation. Thus, our DArch proposes to leverage the dental arch prior to assist the detection. Specifically, we firstly propose a coarse-to-fine method to estimate the dental arch, in which the dental arch is initially generated by Bezier curve regression, and then a graph-based con-volutional network (GCN) is trained to refine it. With the estimated dental arch, we then propose a novel Arch-awarePoint Sampling (APS) method to assist the tooth centroid proposal generation. Meantime, a segmentor is indepen-dently trained using a patch-based training strategy, aim-ing to segment a tooth instance from a 3D patch centered at the tooth centroid. Experimental results on 4, 773 dental models have shown our DArch can accurately segment each tooth of a dental model, and its performance is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.
