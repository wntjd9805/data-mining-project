We propose Iterative Homography Network, namelyIHN, a new deep homography estimation architecture. Dif-ferent from previous works that achieve iterative reﬁnement by network cascading or untrainable IC-LK iterator, the iterator of IHN has tied weights and is completely train-able.IHN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on several datasets including challenging scenes. We propose 2 ver-sions of IHN: (1) IHN for static scenes, (2) IHN-mov for dynamic scenes with moving objects. Both versions can be arranged in 1-scale for efﬁciency or 2-scale for accuracy.We show that the basic 1-scale IHN already outperforms most of the existing methods. On a variety of datasets, the 2-scale IHN outperforms all competitors by a large gap. We introduce IHN-mov by producing an inlier mask to further improve the estimation accuracy of moving-objects scenes.We experimentally show that the iterative framework of IHN can achieve 95% error reduction while considerably sav-ing network parameters. When processing sequential im-age pairs, IHN can achieve 32.7 fps, which is about 8× the speed of IC-LK iterator. Source code is available at https://github.com/imdumpl78/IHN .
