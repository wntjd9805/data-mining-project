Keypoint detection is an essential component for the ob-ject registration and alignment. In this work, we reckon keypoint detection as information compression, and force the model to distill out important points of an object. Based on this, we propose UKPGAN, a general self-supervised 3D keypoint detector where keypoints are detected so that they could reconstruct the original object shape. Two mod-ules: GAN-based keypoint sparsity control and salient in-formation distillation modules are proposed to locate those important keypoints. Extensive experiments show that our keypoints align well with human annotated keypoint labels, and can be applied to SMPL human bodies under various non-rigid deformations. Furthermore, our keypoint detec-tor trained on clean object collections generalizes well to real-world scenarios, thus further improves geometric regis-tration when combined with off-the-shelf point descriptors.Repeatability experiments show that our model is stable under both rigid and non-rigid transformations, with lo-cal reference frame estimation.
