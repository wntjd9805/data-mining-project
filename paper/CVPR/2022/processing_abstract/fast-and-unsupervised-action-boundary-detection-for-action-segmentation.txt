To deal with the great number of untrimmed videos pro-duced every day, we propose an efficient unsupervised ac-tion segmentation method by detecting boundaries, named action boundary detection (ABD). In particular, the pro-posed method has the following advantages: no training stage and low-latency inference. To detect action bound-aries, we estimate the similarities across smoothed frames, which inherently have the properties of internal consistency within actions and external discrepancy across actions. Un-der this circumstance, we successfully transfer the bound-ary detection task into the change point detection based on the similarity. Then, non-maximum suppression (NMS) is conducted in local windows to select the smallest points as candidate boundaries. In addition, a clustering algorithm is followed to refine the initial proposals. Moreover, we also extend ABD to the online setting, which enables real-time action segmentation in long untrimmed videos. By evaluat-ing on four challenging datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, thanks to the efficiency of ABD, we achieve the best trade-off between the accuracy and the inference time compared with existing unsupervised approaches.
