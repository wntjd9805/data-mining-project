Interpreting objects with basic geometric primitives has long been studied in computer vision. Among geometric primitives, superquadrics are well known for their abil-ity to represent a wide range of shapes with few parame-ters. However, as the first and foremost step, recovering superquadrics accurately and robustly from 3D data still re-mains challenging. The existing methods are subject to lo-cal optima and sensitive to noise and outliers in real-world scenarios, resulting in frequent failure in capturing geomet-ric shapes. In this paper, we propose the first probabilistic method to recover superquadrics from point clouds. Our method builds a Gaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the parametric surface of a superquadric, which explic-itly models the generation of outliers and noise. The su-perquadric recovery is formulated as a Maximum Likeli-hood Estimation (MLE) problem. We propose an algorithm,Expectation, Maximization, and Switching (EMS), to solve this problem, where: (1) outliers are predicted from the pos-terior perspective; (2) the superquadric parameter is opti-mized by the trust-region reflective algorithm; and (3) lo-cal optima are avoided by globally searching and switch-ing among parameters encoding similar superquadrics.We show that our method can be extended to the multi-superquadrics recovery for complex objects. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accu-racy, efficiency, and robustness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
