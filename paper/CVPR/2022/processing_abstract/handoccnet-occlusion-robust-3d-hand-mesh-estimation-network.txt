Hands are often severely occluded by objects, which makes 3D hand mesh estimation challenging. Previous works often have disregarded information at occluded re-gions. However, we argue that occluded regions have strong correlations with hands so that they can provide highly ben-eficial information for complete 3D hand mesh estimation.Thus, in this work, we propose a novel 3D hand mesh es-timation network HandOccNet, that can fully exploits the information at occluded regions as a secondary means to enhance image features and make it much richer. To this end, we design two successive Transformer-based mod-ules, called feature injecting transformer (FIT) and self-enhancing transformer (SET). FIT injects hand information into occluded region by considering their correlation. SET refines the output of FIT by using a self-attention mecha-nism. By injecting the hand information to the occluded region, our HandOccNet reaches the state-of-the-art per-formance on 3D hand mesh benchmarks that contain chal-lenging hand-object occlusions.
