Transfer learning has become a popular method for leveraging pre-trained models in computer vision. How-ever, without performing computationally expensive fine-tuning, it is difficult to quantify which pre-trained source models are suitable for a specific target task, or, conversely, to which tasks a pre-trained source model can be eas-In this work, we propose Gaussian Bhat-ily adapted to. tacharyya Coefficient (GBC), a novel method for quanti-fying transferability between a source model and a target dataset. In a first step we embed all target images in the feature space defined by the source model, and represent them with per-class Gaussians. Then, we estimate their pairwise class separability using the Bhattacharyya coef-ficient, yielding a simple and effective measure of how well the source model transfers to the target task. We eval-uate GBC on image classification tasks in the context of dataset and architecture selection. Further, we also per-form experiments on the more complex semantic segmen-tation transferability estimation task. We demonstrate thatGBC outperforms state-of-the-art transferability metrics on most evaluation criteria in the semantic segmentation set-tings, matches the performance of top methods for dataset transferability in image classification, and performs best on architecture selection problems for image classification.
