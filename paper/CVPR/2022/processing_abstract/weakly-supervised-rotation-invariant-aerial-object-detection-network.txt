Object rotation is among long-standing, yet still unex-plored, hard issues encountered in the task of weakly super-vised object detection (WSOD) from aerial images. Exist-ing predominant WSOD approaches built on regular CNNs which are not inherently designed to tackle object rota-tions without corresponding constraints, thereby leading to rotation-sensitive object detector. Meanwhile, current so-lutions have been prone to fall into the issue with unsta-ble detectors, as they ignore lower-scored instances and may regard them as backgrounds. To address these is-sues, in this paper, we construct a novel end-to-end weakly supervised Rotation-Invariant aerial object detection Net-work (RINet).It is implemented with a flexible multi-branch online detector refinement, to be naturally more rotation-perceptive against oriented objects. Specifically,RINet first performs label propagating from the predicted instances to their rotated ones in a progressive refinement manner. Meanwhile, we propose to couple the predicted in-stance labels among different rotation-perceptive branches for generating rotation-consistent supervision and mean-while pursuing all possible instances. With the rotation-consistent supervisions, RINet enforces and encourages consistent yet complementary feature learning for WSOD without additional annotations and hyper-parameters. On the challenging NWPU VHR-10.v2 and DIOR datasets, extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that we signif-icantly boost existing WSOD methods to a new state-of-the-art performance.
