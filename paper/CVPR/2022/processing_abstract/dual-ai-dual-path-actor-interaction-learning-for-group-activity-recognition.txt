Learning spatial-temporal relation among multiple ac-tors is crucial for group activity recognition. Different group activities often show the diversiﬁed interactions be-tween actors in the video. Hence, it is often difﬁcult to model complex group activities from a single view of spatial-temporal actor evolution. To tackle this problem, we propose a distinct Dual-path Actor Interaction (Dual-AI) framework, which ﬂexibly arranges spatial and tempo-ral transformers in two complementary orders, enhancing actor relations by integrating merits from different spatio-temporal paths. Moreover, we introduce a novel Multi-scaleActor Contrastive Loss (MAC-Loss) between two interac-tive paths of Dual-AI. Via self-supervised actor consistency in both frame and video levels, MAC-Loss can effectively distinguish individual actor representations to reduce ac-tion confusion among different actors. Consequently, ourDual-AI can boost group activity recognition by fusing such discriminative features of different actors. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the widely used benchmarks, including Volleyball [21], Col-lective Activity [11], and NBA datasets [49]. The proposedDual-AI achieves state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets. It is worth noting the proposed Dual-AI with 50% training data outperforms a number of recent approaches with 100% training data. This conﬁrms the generalization power of Dual-AI for group activity recognition, even under the challenging scenarios of limited supervision.
