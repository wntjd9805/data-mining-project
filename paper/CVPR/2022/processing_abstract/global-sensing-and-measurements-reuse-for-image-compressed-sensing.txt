Recently, deep network-based image compressed sens-ing methods achieved high reconstruction quality and re-duced computational overhead compared with traditional methods. However, existing methods obtain measurements only from partial features in the network and use it only once for image reconstruction. They ignore there are low, mid, and high-level features in the network [38] and all of them are essential for high-quality reconstruction. More-over, using measurements only once may not be enough for extracting richer information from measurements. To ad-dress these issues, we propose a novel Measurements ReuseConvolutional Compressed Sensing Network (MR-CCSNet) which employs Global Sensing Module (GSM) to collect all level features for achieving an efﬁcient sensing and Mea-surements Reuse Block (MRB) to reuse measurements mul-tiple times on multi-scale. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments on three benchmark datasets to show that our model can signiﬁcantly outperform state-of-the-art meth-ods.
