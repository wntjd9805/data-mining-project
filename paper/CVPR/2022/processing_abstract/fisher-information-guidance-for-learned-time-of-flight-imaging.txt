Indirect Time-of-Flight (ToF) imaging is widely applied in practice for its superiorities on cost and spatial res-olution. However, lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of measurement leads to larger error in ToF imaging, espe-cially for imaging scenes with strong ambient light or long distance.In this paper, we propose a Fisher-information guided framework to jointly optimize the coding functions (light modulation and sensor demodulation functions) and the reconstruction network of iToF imaging, with the super-vision of the proposed discriminative ﬁsher loss. By intro-ducing the differentiable modeling of physical imaging pro-cess considering various real factors and constraints, e.g., light-falloff with distance, physical implementability of cod-ing functions, etc., followed by a dual-branch depth recon-struction neural network, the proposed method could learn the optimal iToF imaging system in an end-to-end manner.The effectiveness of the proposed method is extensively ver-iﬁed with both simulations and prototype experiments.
