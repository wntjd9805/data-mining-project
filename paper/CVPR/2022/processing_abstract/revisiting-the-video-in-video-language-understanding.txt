What makes a video task uniquely suited for videos, be-yond what can be understood from a single image? Build-ing on recent progress in self-supervised image-language models, we revisit this question in the context of video and language tasks. We propose the atemporal probe (ATP), a new model for video-language analysis which provides a stronger bound on the baseline accuracy of multimodal models constrained by image-level understanding. By ap-plying this model to standard discriminative video and lan-guage tasks, such as video question answering and text-to-video retrieval, we characterize the limitations and poten-tial of current video-language benchmarks. We find that un-derstanding of event temporality is often not necessary to achieve strong or state-of-the-art performance, even com-pared with recent large-scale video-language models and in contexts intended to benchmark deeper video-level under-standing. We also demonstrate how ATP can improve both video-language dataset and model design. We describe a technique for leveraging ATP to better disentangle dataset subsets with a higher concentration of temporally challeng-ing data, improving benchmarking efficacy for causal and temporal understanding. Further, we show that effectively integrating ATP into full video-level temporal models can improve efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.1
