Lane detection is a challenging task that requires pre-dicting complex topology shapes of lane lines and distin-guishing different types of lanes simultaneously. Earlier works follow a top-down roadmap to regress predefined an-chors into various shapes of lane lines, which lacks enough flexibility to fit complex shapes of lanes due to the fixed an-chor shapes. Lately, some works propose to formulate lane detection as a keypoint estimation problem to describe the shapes of lane lines more flexibly and gradually group ad-jacent keypoints belonging to the same lane line in a point-by-point manner, which is inefficient and time-consuming during postprocessing. In this paper, we propose a GlobalAssociation Network (GANet) to formulate the lane detec-tion problem from a new perspective, where each keypoint is directly regressed to the starting point of the lane line in-stead of point-by-point extension. Concretely, the associa-tion of keypoints to their belonged lane line is conducted by predicting their offsets to the corresponding starting points of lanes globally without dependence on each other, which could be done in parallel to greatly improve efficiency. In addition, we further propose a Lane-aware Feature Ag-gregator (LFA), which adaptively captures the local cor-relations between adjacent keypoints to supplement local information to the global association. Extensive experi-ments on two popular lane detection benchmarks show that our method outperforms previous methods with F1 score of 79.63% on CULane and 97.71% on Tusimple dataset with high FPS.
