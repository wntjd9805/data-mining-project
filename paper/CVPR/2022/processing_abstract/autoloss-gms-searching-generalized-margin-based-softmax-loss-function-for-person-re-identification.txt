Person re-identification is a hot topic in computer vision, and the loss function plays a vital role in improving the dis-crimination of the learned features. However, most exist-ing models utilize the hand-crafted loss functions, which are usually sub-optimal and challenging to be designed.In this paper, we propose a novel method, AutoLoss-GMS, to search the better loss function in the space of gener-alized margin-based softmax loss function for person re-identification automatically. Specifically, the generalized margin-based softmax loss function is first decomposed into two computational graphs and a constant. Then a gen-eral searching framework built upon the evolutionary al-gorithm is proposed to search for the loss function effi-ciently. The computational graph is constructed with a for-ward method, which can construct much richer loss function forms than the backward method used in existing works.In addition to the basic in-graph mutation operations, the cross-graph mutation operation is designed to further im-prove the offspringâ€™s diversity. The loss-rejection proto-col, equivalence-check strategy and the predictor-based promising-loss chooser are developed to improve the search efficiency. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the searched loss functions can achieve state-of-the-art per-formance and be transferable across different models and datasets in person re-identification.
