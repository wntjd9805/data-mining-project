Camouﬂaged object detection (COD) aims to identify objects that are perfectly embedded in their environment, which has various downstream applications in ﬁelds such as medicine, art, and agriculture. However, it is an ex-tremely challenging task to spot camouﬂaged objects with the perception ability of human eyes. Hence, we claim that the goal of COD task is not just to mimic the human visual ability in a single RGB domain, but to go beyond the human biological vision. We then introduce the frequency domain as an additional clue to better detect camouﬂaged objects from backgrounds. To well involve the frequency clues into the CNN models, we present a powerful network with two special components. We ﬁrst design a novel frequency en-hancement module (FEM) to dig clues of camouﬂaged ob-jects in the frequency domain. It contains the ofﬂine discrete cosine transform followed by the learnable enhancement.Then we use a feature alignment to fuse the features fromRGB domain and frequency domain. Moreover, to further make full use of the frequency information, we propose the high-order relation module (HOR) to handle the rich fusion feature. Comprehensive experiments on three widely-usedCOD datasets show the proposed method signiﬁcantly out-performs other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.
