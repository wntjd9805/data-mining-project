Learning single image deraining (SID) networks from an unpaired set of clean and rainy images is practical and valuable as acquiring paired real-world data is al-most infeasible. However, without the paired data as the supervision, learning a SID network is challenging. More-over, simply using existing unpaired learning methods (e.g., unpaired adversarial learning and cycle-consistency con-straints) in the SID task is insufﬁcient to learn the under-lying relationship from rainy inputs to clean outputs as there exists signiﬁcant domain gap between the rainy andIn this paper, we develop an effective un-clean images. paired SID adversarial framework which explores mutual properties of the unpaired exemplars by a dual contrastive learning manner in a deep feature space, named as DCD-GAN. The proposed method mainly consists of two coop-erative branches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive Guidance Branch (CGB). Speciﬁcally, BTB exploits full advantage of the circulatory architecture of ad-versarial consistency to generate abundant exemplar pairs and excavates latent feature distributions between two do-mains by equipping it with bidirectional mapping. Simulta-neously, CGB implicitly constrains the embeddings of dif-ferent exemplars in the deep feature space by encouraging the similar feature distributions closer while pushing the dissimilar further away, in order to better facilitate rain re-moval and help image restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against existing unpaired deraining approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and generates comparable results against several fully-supervised or semi-supervised models.
