Adversarial training (AT) is always formulated as a min-imax problem, of which the performance depends on the inner optimization that involves the generation of adver-sarial examples (AEs). Most previous methods adopt Pro-jected Gradient Decent (PGD) with manually specifying at-tack parameters for AE generation. A combination of the attack parameters can be referred to as an attack strategy.Several works have revealed that using a ﬁxed attack strat-egy to generate AEs during the whole training phase lim-its the model robustness and propose to exploit different at-tack strategies at different training stages to improve robust-ness. But those multi-stage hand-crafted attack strategies need much domain expertise, and the robustness improve-ment is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel frame-work for adversarial training by introducing the concept of“learnable attack strategy”, dubbed LAS-AT, which learns to automatically produce attack strategies to improve the model robustness. Our framework is composed of a tar-get network that uses AEs for training to improve robust-ness, and a strategy network that produces attack strate-gies to control the AE generation. Experimental evalua-tions on three benchmark databases demonstrate the su-periority of the proposed method. The code is released at https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/LAS-AT.
