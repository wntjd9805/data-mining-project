Estimating the 3DoF rotation from a single RGB im-age is an important yet challenging problem. Recent works achieve good performance relying on a large amount of expensive-to-obtain labeled data. To reduce the amount of supervision, we for the first time propose a general framework, FisherMatch, for semi-supervised rotation re-gression, without assuming any domain-specific knowledge or paired data.Inspired by the popular semi-supervised approach, FixMatch, we propose to leverage pseudo la-bel filtering to facilitate the information flow from labeled data to unlabeled data in a teacher-student mutual learn-ing framework. However, incorporating the pseudo label filtering mechanism into semi-supervised rotation regres-sion is highly non-trivial, mainly due to the lack of a re-liable confidence measure for rotation prediction. In this work, we propose to leverage matrix Fisher distribution to build a probabilistic model of rotation and devise a matrixFisher-based regressor for jointly predicting rotation along with its prediction uncertainty. We then propose to use the entropy of the predicted distribution as a confidence mea-sure, which enables us to perform pseudo label filtering for rotation regression. For supervising such distribution-like pseudo labels, we further investigate the problem of how to enforce loss between two matrix Fisher distribu-tions. Our extensive experiments show that our method can work well even under very low labeled data ratios on differ-ent benchmarks, achieving significant and consistent per-formance improvement over supervised learning and other semi-supervised learning baselines.
