In this paper, we present an end-to-end instance segmen-tation method that regresses a polygonal boundary for each object instance. This sparse, vectorized boundary repre-sentation for objects, while attractive in many downstream computer vision tasks, quickly runs into issues of parity that need to be addressed: parity in supervision and parity in performance when compared to existing pixel-based meth-ods. This is due in part to object instances being anno-tated with ground-truth in the form of polygonal boundaries or segmentation masks, yet being evaluated in a conve-nient manner using only segmentation masks. Our method,BoundaryFormer, is a Transformer based architecture that directly predicts polygons yet uses instance mask segmen-tations as the ground-truth supervision for computing the loss. We achieve this by developing an end-to-end differ-entiable model that solely relies on supervision within the mask space through differentiable rasterization. Boundary-Former matches or surpasses the Mask R-CNN method in terms of instance segmentation quality on both COCO andCityscapes while exhibiting significantly better transferabil-ity across datasets.
