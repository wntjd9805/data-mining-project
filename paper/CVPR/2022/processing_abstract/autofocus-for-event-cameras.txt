Focus control (FC) is crucial for cameras to capture sharp images in challenging real-world scenarios. The aut-ofocus (AF) facilitates the FC by automatically adjusting the focus settings. However, due to the lack of effectiveAF methods for the recently introduced event cameras, theirFC still relies on naive AF like manual focus adjustments, leading to poor adaptation in challenging real-world condi-tions. In particular, the inherent differences between event and frame data in terms of sensing modality, noise, tem-poral resolutions, etc., bring many challenges in design-ing an effective AF method for event cameras. To address these challenges, we develop a novel event-based autofo-cus framework consisting of an event-specific focus measure called event rate (ER) and a robust search strategy called event-based golden search (EGS). To verify the perfor-mance of our method, we have collected an event-based aut-ofocus dataset (EAD) containing well-synchronized frames, events, and focal positions in a wide variety of challenging scenes with severe lighting and motion conditions. The ex-periments on this dataset and additional real-world scenar-ios demonstrated the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
