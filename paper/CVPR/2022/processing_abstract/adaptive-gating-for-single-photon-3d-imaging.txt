Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are growing in popularity for depth sensing tasks. However, SPADs still struggle in the presence of high ambient light due to the effects of pile-up. Conventional techniques leverage fixed or asynchronous gating to minimize pile-up effects, but these gating schemes are all non-adaptive, as they are unable to incorporate factors such as scene priors and pre-vious photon detections into their gating strategy. We pro-pose an adaptive gating scheme built upon Thompson sam-pling. Adaptive gating periodically updates the gate posi-tion based on prior photon observations in order to mini-mize depth errors. Our experiments show that our gating strategy results in significantly reduced depth reconstruc-tion error and acquisition time, even when operating out-doors under strong sunlight conditions.
