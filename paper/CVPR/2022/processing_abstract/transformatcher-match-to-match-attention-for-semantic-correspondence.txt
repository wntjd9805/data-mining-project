Establishing correspondences between images remains a challenging task, especially under large appearance changes due to different viewpoints or intra-class varia-tions. In this work, we introduce a strong semantic image matching learner, dubbed TransforMatcher, which builds on the success of transformer networks in vision domains. Un-like existing convolution- or attention-based schemes for correspondence, TransforMatcher performs global match-to-match attention for precise match localization and dy-namic reﬁnement. To handle a large number of matches in a dense correlation map, we develop a light-weight attention architecture to consider the global match-to-match interac-tions. We also propose to utilize a multi-channel correla-tion map for reﬁnement, treating the multi-level scores as features instead of a single score to fully exploit the richer layer-wise semantics. In experiments, TransforMatcher sets a new state of the art on SPair-71k while performing on par with existing SOTA methods on the PF-PASCAL dataset.
