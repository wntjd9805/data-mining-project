Existing active learning studies typically work in the closed-set setting by assuming that all data examples to be labeled are drawn from known classes. However, in real annotation tasks, the unlabeled data usually contains a large amount of examples from unknown classes, resulting in the failure of most active learning methods. To tackle this open-set annotation (OSA) problem, we propose a new active learning framework called LfOSA, which boosts the classi-fication performance with an effective sampling strategy to precisely detect examples from known classes for annotation.The LfOSA framework introduces an auxiliary network to model the per-example max activation value (MAV) distribu-tion with a Gaussian Mixture Model, which can dynamically select the examples with highest probability from known classes in the unlabeled set. Moreover, by reducing the tem-perature T of the loss function, the detection model will be further optimized by exploiting both known and unknown su-pervision. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the selection quality of known classes, and achieve higher classification accuracy with lower annotation cost than state-of-the-art active learn-ing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of active learning for open-set annotation.
