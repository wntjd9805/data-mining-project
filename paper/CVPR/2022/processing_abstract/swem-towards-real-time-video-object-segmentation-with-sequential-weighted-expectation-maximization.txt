inference.Matching-based methods, especially those based on space-time memory, are significantly ahead of other solu-tions in semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS).However, continuously growing and redundant template features lead to an inefficientTo alleviate this, we propose a novel Sequential Weighted Expectation-Maximization (SWEM) network to greatly reduce the re-dundancy of memory features. Different from the previ-ous methods which only detect feature redundancy between frames, SWEM merges both intra-frame and inter-frame similar features by leveraging the sequential weighted EM algorithm. Further, adaptive weights for frame features en-dow SWEM with the flexibility to represent hard samples, improving the discrimination of templates. Besides, the pro-posed method maintains a fixed number of template features in memory, which ensures the stable inference complexity of the VOS system. Extensive experiments on commonly usedDAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets verify the high efficiency (36 FPS) and high performance (84.3% J &F on DAVIS 2017 validation dataset) of SWEM.
