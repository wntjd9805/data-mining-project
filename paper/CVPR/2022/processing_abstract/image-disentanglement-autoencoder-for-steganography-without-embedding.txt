Conventional steganography approaches embed a secret message into a carrier for concealed communication but are prone to attack by recent advanced steganalysis tools.In this paper, we propose Image DisEntanglement Autoen-coder for Steganography (IDEAS) as a novel steganography without embedding (SWE) technique.Instead of directly embedding the secret message into a carrier image, our ap-proach hides it by transforming it into a synthesised image, and is thus fundamentally immune to typical steganalysis at-tacks. By disentangling an image into two representations for structure and texture, we exploit the stability of structure representation to improve secret message extraction while increasing synthesis diversity via randomising texture rep-resentations to enhance steganography security.In addi-tion, we design an adaptive mapping mechanism to further enhance the diversity of synthesised images when ensur-ing different required extraction levels. Experimental re-sults convincingly demonstrate IDEAS to achieve superior performance in terms of enhanced security, reliable secret message extraction and ï¬‚exible adaptation for different ex-traction levels, compared to state-of-the-art SWE methods.
