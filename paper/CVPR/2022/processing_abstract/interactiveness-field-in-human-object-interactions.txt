Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection plays a core role in activity understanding. Though recent two/one-stage methods have achieved impressive results, as an es-sential step, discovering interactive human-object pairs re-mains challenging. Both one/two-stage methods fail to ef-fectively extract interactive pairs instead of generating re-dundant negative pairs. In this work, we introduce a pre-viously overlooked interactiveness bimodal prior: given an object in an image, after pairing it with the humans, the generated pairs are either mostly non-interactive, or mostly interactive, with the former more frequent than the latter. Based on this interactiveness bimodal prior we pro-pose the “interactiveness field”. To make the learned field compatible with real HOI image considerations, we pro-pose new energy constraints based on the cardinality and difference in the inherent “interactiveness field” underly-ing interactive versus non-interactive pairs. Consequently, our method can detect more precise pairs and thus signifi-cantly boost HOI detection performance, which is validated on widely-used benchmarks where we achieve decent im-provements over state-of-the-arts.
