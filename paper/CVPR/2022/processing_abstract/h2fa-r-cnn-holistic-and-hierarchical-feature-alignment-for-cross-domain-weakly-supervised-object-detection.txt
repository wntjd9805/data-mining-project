Cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CD-WSOD) aims to adapt the detection model to a novel tar-get domain with easily acquired image-level annotations.How to align the source and target domains is critical to the CDWSOD accuracy. Existing methods usually focus on partial detection components for domain alignment. In contrast, this paper considers that all the detection com-ponents are important and proposes a Holistic and Hier-archical Feature Alignment (H2FA) R-CNN. H2FA R-CNN enforces two image-level alignments for the backbone fea-tures, as well as two instance-level alignments for the RPN and detection head. This coarse-to-fine aligning hierar-chy is in pace with the detection pipeline, i.e., process-ing the image-level feature and the instance-level features from bottom to top. Importantly, we devise a novel hybrid supervision method for learning two instance-level align-ments. It enables the RPN and detection head to simultane-ously receive weak/full supervision from the target/source domains. Combining all these feature alignments, H2FAR-CNN effectively mitigates the gap between the source and target domains. Experimental results show that H2FAR-CNN significantly improves cross-domain object detec-tion accuracy and sets new state of the art on popular benchmarks.
