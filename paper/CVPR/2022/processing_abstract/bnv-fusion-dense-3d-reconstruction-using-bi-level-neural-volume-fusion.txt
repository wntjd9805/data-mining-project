Dense 3D reconstruction from a stream of depth images is the key to many mixed reality and robotic applications.Although methods based on Truncated Signed DistanceFunction (TSDF) Fusion have advanced the ﬁeld over the years, the TSDF volume representation is confronted with striking a balance between the robustness to noisy mea-surements and maintaining the level of detail. We presentBi-level Neural Volume Fusion (BNV-Fusion), which lever-ages recent advances in neural implicit representations and neural rendering for dense 3D reconstruction. In order to incrementally integrate new depth maps into a global neu-ral implicit representation, we propose a novel bi-level fu-sion strategy that considers both efﬁciency and reconstruc-tion quality by design. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple datasets quantitatively and qualitatively, demon-strating a signiﬁcant improvement over existing methods.
