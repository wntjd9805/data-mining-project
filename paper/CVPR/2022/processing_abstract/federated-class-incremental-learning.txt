Federated learning (FL) has attracted growing atten-tions via data-private collaborative training on decentral-ized clients. However, most existing methods unrealistically assume object classes of the overall framework are fixed over time. It makes the global model suffer from significant catastrophic forgetting on old classes in real-world scenar-ios, where local clients often collect new classes continu-ously and have very limited storage memory to store old classes. Moreover, new clients with unseen new classes may participate in the FL training, further aggravating the catastrophic forgetting of global model. To address these challenges, we develop a novel Global-Local Forgetting to learn a global class-Compensation (GLFC) model, incremental model for alleviating the catastrophic forget-ting from both local and global perspectives. Specifically, to address local forgetting caused by class imbalance at the local clients, we design a class-aware gradient com-pensation loss and a class-semantic relation distillation loss to balance the forgetting of old classes and distill consistent inter-class relations across tasks. To tackle the global forgetting brought by the non-i.i.d class imbalance across clients, we propose a proxy server that selects the best old global model to assist the local relation distilla-tion. Moreover, a prototype gradient-based communication mechanism is developed to protect the privacy. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.4%∼15.1% in terms of average accuracy on representative benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github. com/conditionWang/FCIL.
