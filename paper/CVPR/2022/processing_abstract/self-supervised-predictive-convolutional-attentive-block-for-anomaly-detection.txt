Anomaly detection is commonly pursued as a one-class classiﬁcation problem, where models can only learn from normal training samples, while being evaluated on both normal and abnormal test samples. Among the success-ful approaches for anomaly detection, a distinguished cat-egory of methods relies on predicting masked information (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and leveraging the recon-struction error with respect to the masked information as an abnormality score. Different from related methods, we propose to integrate the reconstruction-based functionality into a novel self-supervised predictive architectural build-ing block. The proposed self-supervised block is generic and can easily be incorporated into various state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Our block starts with a con-volutional layer with dilated ﬁlters, where the center area of the receptive ﬁeld is masked. The resulting activation maps are passed through a channel attention module. Our block is equipped with a loss that minimizes the reconstruc-tion error with respect to the masked area in the recep-tive ﬁeld. We demonstrate the generality of our block by integrating it into several state-of-the-art frameworks for anomaly detection on image and video, providing empiri-cal evidence that shows considerable performance improve-ments on MVTec AD, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech.
