We present Neural Mixtures of Planar Experts (Neur-MiPs), a novel planar-based scene representation for mod-eling geometry and appearance. NeurMiPs leverages a collection of local planar experts in 3D space as the scene representation. Each planar expert consists of the param-eters of the local rectangular shape representing geometry and a neural radiance field modeling the color and opacity.We render novel views by calculating ray-plane intersections and composite output colors and densities at intersected points to the image. NeurMiPs blends the efficiency of ex-plicit mesh rendering and flexibility of the neural radiance field. Experiments demonstrate superior performance and speed of our proposed method, compared to other 3D repre-sentations in novel view synthesis.
