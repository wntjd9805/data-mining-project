AugmentationAugmentationExisting person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) methods typi-cally load the pre-trained ImageNet weights for initial-ization directly. However, as a ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation task, ReID is more challenging and there exists a large domain gap between ImageNet classiﬁcation. Inspired by the great success of self-supervised representation learn-ing with contrastive objectives, in this paper, we design anUnsupervised Pre-training framework for re-identiﬁcation (UP-ReID) based on the contrastive learning (CL) pipeline.During the pre-training, we attempt to address two critical issues for learning ﬁne-grained ReID features: (1) the aug-mentations in the CL pipeline usually distort the discrimi-native clues in person images, and (2) the ﬁne-grained lo-cal features of person images are not fully-explored. There-fore, we introduce an intra-identity (I2-)regularization in the UP-ReID, which is instantiated as two constraints com-ing from the global image and local patch aspects, respec-tively. A global consistency constraint is enforced between augmented and original person images to increase robust-ness to augmentation, while an intrinsic contrastive con-straint among local patches of each image is employed to fully explore the local discriminative clues. Extensive ex-periments on multiple popular Re-ID datasets, PersonX,Market1501, CUHK03, and MSMT17, demonstrate that ourUP-ReID pre-trained model can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the downstream ReID ﬁne-tuning and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
