Due to the constraints of the imaging device and high cost in operation time, computer tomography (CT) scans are usually acquired with low within-slice resolution. Im-proving the inter-slice resolution is beneﬁcial to the disease diagnosis for both human experts and computer-aided sys-tems. To this end, this paper builds a novel medical slice synthesis to increase the inter-slice resolution. Consider-ing that the ground-truth intermediate medical slices are al-ways absent in clinical practice, we introduce the incremen-tal cross-view mutual distillation strategy to accomplish this task in the self-supervised learning manner. Speciﬁcally, we model this problem from three different views: slice-wise interpolation from axial view and pixel-wise interpolation from coronal and sagittal views. Under this circumstance, the models learned from different views can distill valuable knowledge to guide the learning processes of each other.We can repeat this process to make the models synthesize intermediate slice data with increasing between-slice reso-lution. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ap-proach, we conduct comprehensive experiments on a large-scale CT dataset. Quantitative and qualitative comparison results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by clear margins.
