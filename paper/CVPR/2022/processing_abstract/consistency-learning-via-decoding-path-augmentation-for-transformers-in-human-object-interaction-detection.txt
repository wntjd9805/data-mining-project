Human-Object Interaction detection is a holistic visual recognition task that entails object detection as well as in-teraction classification. Previous works of HOI detection has been addressed by the various compositions of sub-set predictions, e.g., Image → HO → I, Image → HI →O. Recently, transformer based architecture for HOI has emerged, which directly predicts the HOI triplets in an end-to-end fashion (Image → HOI). Motivated by various in-ference paths for HOI detection, we propose cross-path consistency learning (CPC), which is a novel end-to-end learning strategy to improve HOI detection for transform-ers by leveraging augmented decoding paths. CPC learning enforces all the possible predictions from permuted infer-ence sequences to be consistent. This simple scheme makes the model learn consistent representations, thereby improv-ing generalization without increasing model capacity. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we achieved significant improvement on V-COCO andHICO-DET compared to the baseline models.
