Capturing multimodal natures is essential for stochastic pedestrian trajectory prediction, to infer a finite set of future trajectories. The inferred trajectories are based on obser-vation paths and the latent vectors of potential decisions of pedestrians in the inference step. However, stochastic approaches provide varying results for the same data and parameter settings, due to the random sampling of the latentIn this paper, we analyze the problem by recon-vector. structing and comparing probabilistic distributions from pre-diction samples and socially-acceptable paths, respectively.Through this analysis, we observe that the inferences of all stochastic models are biased toward the random sampling, and fail to generate a set of realistic paths from finite samples.The problem cannot be resolved unless an infinite number of samples is available, which is infeasible in practice. We intro-duce that the Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method, ensuring uniform coverage on the sampling space, as an alternative to the conventional random sampling. With the same finite number of samples, the QMC improves all the multimodal prediction results. We take an additional step ahead by in-corporating a learnable sampling network into the existing networks for trajectory prediction. For this purpose, we pro-pose the Non-Probability Sampling Network (NPSN), a very small network (âˆ¼5K parameters) that generates purposive sample sequences using the past paths of pedestrians and their social interactions. Extensive experiments confirm thatNPSN can significantly improve both the prediction accuracy (up to 60%) and reliability of the public pedestrian trajec-tory prediction benchmark.
