Multi-view Stereo (MVS) with known camera parame-ters is essentially a 1D search problem within a valid depth range. Recent deep learning-based MVS methods typically densely sample depth hypotheses in the depth range, and then construct prohibitively memory-consuming 3D cost volumes for depth prediction. Although coarse-to-fine sam-pling strategies alleviate this overhead issue to a certain extent, the efficiency of MVS is still an open challenge.In this work, we propose a novel method for highly ef-ficient MVS that remarkably decreases the memory foot-print, meanwhile clearly advancing state-of-the-art depth prediction performance. We investigate what a search strat-egy can be reasonably optimal for MVS taking into ac-count of both efficiency and effectiveness. We first formu-late MVS as a binary search problem, and accordingly pro-pose a generalized binary search network for MVS. Specif-ically, in each step, the depth range is split into 2 bins with extra 1 error tolerance bin on both sides. A classifi-cation is performed to identify which bin contains the true depth. We also design three mechanisms to respectively handle classification errors, deal with out-of-range sam-ples and decrease the training memory. The new formu-lation makes our method only sample a very small number of depth hypotheses in each step, which is highly memory efficient, and also greatly facilitates quick training conver-gence. Experiments on competitive benchmarks show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much less memory. Particularly, our method obtains an overall score of 0.289 on DTU dataset and tops the first place on challenging Tanks and Temples advanced dataset among all the learning-based methods.
