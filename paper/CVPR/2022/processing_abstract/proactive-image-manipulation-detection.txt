Image manipulation detection algorithms are often trained to discriminate between images manipulated with particular Generative Models (GMs) and genuine/real im-ages, yet generalize poorly to images manipulated withGMs unseen in the training. Conventional detection algo-rithms receive an input image passively. By contrast, we propose a proactive scheme to image manipulation detec-tion. Our key enabling technique is to estimate a set of tem-plates which when added onto the real image would lead to more accurate manipulation detection. That is, a template protected real image, and its manipulated version, is better discriminated compared to the original real image vs. its manipulated one. These templates are estimated using cer-tain constraints based on the desired properties of tem-plates. For image manipulation detection, our proposed ap-proach outperforms the prior work by an average precision of 16% for CycleGAN and 32% for GauGAN. Our approach is generalizable to a variety of GMs showing an improve-ment over prior work by an average precision of 10% aver-aged across 12 GMs. Our code is available at https:// www.github.com/vishal3477/proactive_IMD.
