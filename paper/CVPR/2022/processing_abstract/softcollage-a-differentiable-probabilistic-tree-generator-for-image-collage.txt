Image collage task aims to create an informative and visual-aesthetic visual summarization for an image collec-tion. While several recent works exploit tree-based algo-rithm to preserve image content better, all of them resort to hand-crafted adjustment rules to optimize the collage tree structure, leading to the failure of fully exploring the struc-ture space of collage tree. Our key idea is to soften the discrete tree structure space into a continuous probability space. We propose SoftCollage, a novel method that em-ploys a neural-based differentiable probabilistic tree gener-ator to produce the probability distribution of correlation-preserving collage tree conditioned on deep image feature, aspect ratio and canvas size. The differentiable character-istic allows us to formulate the tree-based collage gener-ation as a differentiable process and directly exploit gra-dient to optimize the collage layout in the level of proba-bility space in an end-to-end manner. To facilitate image collage research, we propose AIC, a large-scale public-available annotated dataset for image collage evaluation.Extensive experiments on the introduced dataset demon-strate the superior performance of the proposed method.Data and codes are available at https://github. com/ChineseYjh/SoftCollage.
