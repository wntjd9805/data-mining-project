To address the huge labeling cost in large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation, we propose a novel hy-brid contrastive regularization (HybridCR) framework in weakly-supervised setting, which obtains competitive per-formance compared to its fully-supervised counterpart.Specifically, HybridCR is the first framework to leverage both point consistency and employ contrastive regulariza-tion with pseudo labeling in an end-to-end manner. Fun-damentally, HybridCR explicitly and effectively considers the semantic similarity between local neighboring points and global characteristics of 3D classes. We further de-sign a dynamic point cloud augmentor to generate diver-sity and robust sample views, whose transformation param-eter is jointly optimized with model training. Through ex-tensive experiments, HybridCR achieves significant perfor-mance improvement against the SOTA methods on both in-door and outdoor datasets, e.g., S3DIS, ScanNet-V2, Se-mantic3D, and SemanticKITTI.
