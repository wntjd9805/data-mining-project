Slow shutter speed and long exposure time of frame-based cameras often cause visual blur and loss of inter-frame information, degenerating the overall quality of cap-tured videos. To this end, we present a unified framework of event-based motion deblurring and frame interpolation for blurry video enhancement, where the extremely low latency of events is leveraged to alleviate motion blur and facilitate intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the mapping re-lation between blurry frames and sharp latent images is first predicted by a learnable double integral network, and a fu-sion network is then proposed to refine the coarse results via utilizing the information from consecutive blurry inputs and the concurrent events. By exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event streams, we further propose a self-supervised learning framework to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art ap-proaches and achieves remarkable performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
