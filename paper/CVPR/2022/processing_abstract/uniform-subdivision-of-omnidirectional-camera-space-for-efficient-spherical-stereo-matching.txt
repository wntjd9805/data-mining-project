Omnidirectional cameras have been used widely to better understand surrounding environments. They are often config-ured as stereo to estimate depth. However, due to the optics of the fisheye lens, conventional epipolar geometry is inap-plicable directly to omnidirectional camera images. Interme-diate formats of omnidirectional images, such as equirect-angular images, have been used. However, stereo matching performance on these image formats has been lower than the conventional stereo due to severe image distortion near pole regions. In this paper, to address the distortion problem of omnidirectional images, we devise a novel subdivision scheme of a spherical geodesic grid. This enables more isotropic patch sampling of spherical image information in the omnidirectional camera space. By extending the existing equal-arc scheme, our spherical geodesic grid is tessellated with an equal-epiline subdivision scheme, making the cell sizes and in-between distances as uniform as possible, i.e., the arc length of the spherical grid cellâ€™s edges is well regu-larized. Also, our uniformly tessellated coordinates in a 2D image can be transformed into spherical coordinates via one-to-one mapping, allowing for analytical forward/backward transformation. Our uniform tessellation scheme achieves a higher accuracy of stereo matching than the traditional cylindrical and cubemap-based approaches, reducing the memory footage required for stereo matching by 20%.
