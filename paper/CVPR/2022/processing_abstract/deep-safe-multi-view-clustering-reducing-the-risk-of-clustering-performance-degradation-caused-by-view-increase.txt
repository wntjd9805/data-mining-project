can fully discover the potential structure hidden in multi-view data and achieve better clustering performance.Multi-view clustering has been shown to boost cluster-ing performance by effectively mining the complementary information from multiple views. However, we observe that learning from data with more views is not guaranteed to achieve better clustering performance than from data with fewer views. To address this issue, we propose a general deep learning based framework that is guaranteed to re-duce the risk of performance degradation caused by view increase. Concretely, the model is trained to simultaneously extract complementary information and discard the mean-ingless noise by automatically selecting features. These two learning procedures are incorporated into one unified framework by the proposed optimization objective. In the-ory, the empirical clustering risk of the model is no higher than learning from data before the view increase and data of the new increased single view. Also, the expected clus-tering risk of the model under divergence-based loss is no higher than that with high probability. Comprehensive ex-periments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effective-ness and superiority of the proposed framework in achiev-ing safe multi-view clustering.
