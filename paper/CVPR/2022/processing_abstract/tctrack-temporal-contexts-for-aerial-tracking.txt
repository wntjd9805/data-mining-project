Online Feature ExtractionSimilarity Map RefinementTemporal contexts among consecutive frames are far from being fully utilized in existing visual trackers. In this work, we present TCTrack1, a comprehensive framework to fully exploit temporal contexts for aerial tracking. The tem-poral contexts are incorporated at two levels: the extraction of features and the reﬁnement of similarity maps. Speciﬁ-cally, for feature extraction, an online temporally adaptive convolution is proposed to enhance the spatial features us-ing temporal information, which is achieved by dynamically calibrating the convolution weights according to the previ-ous frames. For similarity map reﬁnement, we propose an adaptive temporal transformer, which ﬁrst effectively en-codes temporal knowledge in a memory-efﬁcient way, be-fore the temporal knowledge is decoded for accurate ad-justment of the similarity map. TCTrack is effective and efﬁ-cient: evaluation on four aerial tracking benchmarks shows its impressive performance; real-world UAV tests show its high speed of over 27 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier.
