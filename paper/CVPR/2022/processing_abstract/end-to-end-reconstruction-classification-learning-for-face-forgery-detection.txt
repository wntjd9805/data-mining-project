Existing face forgery detectors mainly focus on speciﬁc forgery patterns like noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics for forgery detection. This causes spe-cialization of learned representations to known forgery pat-terns presented in the training set, and makes it difﬁcult to detect forgeries with unknown patterns. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a forgery detection frame-work emphasizing the common compact representations of genuine faces based on reconstruction-classiﬁcation learn-ing. Reconstruction learning over real images enhances the learned representations to be aware of forgery patterns that are even unknown, while classiﬁcation learning takes the charge of mining the essential discrepancy between real and fake images, facilitating the understanding of forgeries. To achieve better representations, instead of only using the en-coder in reconstruction learning, we build bipartite graphs over the encoder and decoder features in a multi-scale fash-ion. We further exploit the reconstruction difference as guidance of forgery traces on the graph output as the ﬁnal representation, which is fed into the classiﬁer for forgery detection. The reconstruction and classiﬁcation learning is optimized end-to-end. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the pro-posed method over state of the arts.
