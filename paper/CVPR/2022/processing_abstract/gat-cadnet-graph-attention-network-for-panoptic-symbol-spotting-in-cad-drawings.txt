Spotting graphical symbols from the computer-aided de-sign (CAD) drawings is essential to many industrial appli-cations. Different from raster images, CAD drawings are vector graphics consisting of geometric primitives such as segments, arcs, and circles. By treating each CAD draw-ing as a graph, we propose a novel graph attention net-work GAT-CADNet to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem: vertex features derived from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, while their attention scores are cascaded and mapped to instance prediction. Our key con-tributions are three-fold: 1) the instance symbol spotting task is formulated as a subgraph detection problem and solved by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) a relative spatial encoding (RSE) module explicitly encodes the rel-ative positional and geometric relation among vertices to enhance the vertex attention; 3) a cascaded edge encod-ing (CEE) module extracts vertex attentions from multiple stages of GAT and treats them as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. The proposed GAT-CADNet is intu-itive yet effective and manages to solve the panoptic sym-bol spotting problem in one consolidated network. Exten-sive experiments and ablation studies on the public bench-mark show that our graph-based approach surpasses exist-ing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

A patch of floor plan (a) and its panoptic symbol spotting results (b), where line semantics are color coded and instances are presented by translucent rectangles. The BIM model (c) with com-plete semantic and accurate geometry can be reconstructed from such annotated floor plan. We only show 3D model of wall, win-dows and doors for the sake of clarity.
