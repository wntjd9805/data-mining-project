Existing approaches for Structure from Motion (SfM) pro-duce impressive 3-D reconstruction results especially when using imagery captured with large parallax. However, to create engaging video-content in movies and TV shows, the amount by which a camera can be moved while ﬁlming a particular shot is often limited. The resulting small-motion parallax between video frames makes standard geometry-based SfM approaches not as effective for movies and TV shows. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that uses single-frame depth-prior ob-tained from a pretrained network to signiﬁcantly improve geometry-based SfM for our small-parallax setting. To this end, we ﬁrst use the depth-estimates of the detected key-points to reconstruct the point cloud and camera-pose for initial two-view reconstruction. We then perform depth-regularized optimization to register new images and trian-gulate the new points during incremental reconstruction.To comprehensively evaluate our approach, we introduce a new dataset (StudioSfM) consisting of 130 shots with 21K frames from 15 studio-produced videos that are man-ually annotated by a professional CG studio. We demon-strate that our approach: (a) signiﬁcantly improves the quality of 3-D reconstruction for our small-parallax set-ting, (b) does not cause any degradation for data with large-parallax, and (c) maintains the generalizability and scalability of geometry-based sparse SfM.
