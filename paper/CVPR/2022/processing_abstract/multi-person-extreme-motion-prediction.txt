Human motion prediction aims to forecast future poses given a sequence of past 3D skeletons. While this prob-lem has recently received increasing attention, it has mostly been tackled for single humans in isolation. In this paper, we explore this problem when dealing with humans per-forming collaborative tasks, we seek to predict the future motion of two interacted persons given two sequences of their past skeletons. We propose a novel cross interaction attention mechanism that exploits historical information of both persons, and learns to predict cross dependencies be-tween the two pose sequences. Since no dataset to train such interactive situations is available, we collected ExPI (Extreme Pose Interaction) dataset, a new lab-based per-*Equal contribution.â€ This research was supported by ANR-3IA MIAI (ANR-19-P3IA-0003), ANR-JCJC ML3RI (ANR-19-CE33-0008-01), H2020 SPRING (funded by EC under GA #871245), by the Spanish government with the project MoHuCo PID2020-120049RB-I00 and by an Amazon ResearchAward.
