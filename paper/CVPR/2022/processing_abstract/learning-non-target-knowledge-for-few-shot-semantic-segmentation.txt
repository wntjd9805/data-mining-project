Existing studies in few-shot semantic segmentation only focus on mining the target object information, however, of-ten are hard to tell ambiguous regions, especially in non-target regions, which include background (BG) and Dis-tracting Objects (DOs). To alleviate this problem, we pro-pose a novel framework, namely Non-Target Region Elim-inating (NTRE) network, to explicitly mine and eliminateBG and DO regions in the query. First, a BG MiningModule (BGMM) is proposed to extract the BG region via learning a general BG prototype. To this end, we design a BG loss to supervise the learning of BGMM only using the known target object segmentation ground truth. Then, a BG Eliminating Module and a DO Eliminating Module are proposed to successively filter out the BG and DO in-formation from the query feature, based on which we can obtain a BG and DO-free target object segmentation result.Furthermore, we propose a prototypical contrastive learn-ing algorithm to improve the model ability of distinguish-ing the target object from DOs. Extensive experiments on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets show that our ap-proach is effective despite its simplicity. Code is available at https://github.com/LIUYUANWEI98/NERTNet
