Current Siamese-based trackers mainly formulate the vi-sual tracking into two independent subtasks, including clas-siﬁcation and localization. They learn the classiﬁcation subnetwork by processing each sample separately and ne-glect the relationship among positive and negative samples.Moreover, such tracking paradigm takes only the classiﬁca-tion conﬁdence of proposals for the ﬁnal prediction, which may yield the misalignment between classiﬁcation and lo-calization. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes a ranking-based optimization algorithm to explore the rela-tionship among different proposals. To this end, we intro-duce two ranking losses, including the classiﬁcation one and the IoU-guided one, as optimization constraints. The classiﬁcation ranking loss can ensure that positive sam-ples rank higher than hard negative ones, i.e., distractors, so that the trackers can select the foreground samples suc-cessfully without being fooled by the distractors. The IoU-guided ranking loss aims to align classiﬁcation conﬁdence scores with the Intersection over Union(IoU) of the corre-sponding localization prediction for positive samples, en-abling the well-localized prediction to be represented by high classiﬁcation conﬁdence. Speciﬁcally, the proposed t-wo ranking losses are compatible with most Siamese track-ers and incur no additional computation for inference. Ex-tensive experiments on seven tracking benchmarks, includ-ing OTB100, UAV123, TC128, VOT2016, NFS30, GOT-10k and LaSOT, demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-posed ranking-based optimization algorithm.
