Deep learning based single image super-resolution mod-els have been widely studied and superb results are achieved in upscaling low-resolution images with ﬁxed scale factor and downscaling degradation kernel. To im-prove real world applicability of such models, there are growing interests to develop models optimized for arbi-trary upscaling factors. Our proposed method is the ﬁrst to treat arbitrary rescaling, both upscaling and downscal-ing, as one uniﬁed process. Using joint optimization of both directions, the proposed model is able to learn upscaling and downscaling simultaneously and achieve bidirectional arbitrary image rescaling.It improves the performance of current arbitrary upscaling models by a large margin while at the same time learns to maintain visual percep-tion quality in downscaled images. The proposed model is further shown to be robust in cycle idempotence test, free of severe degradations in reconstruction accuracy when the downscaling-to-upscaling cycle is applied repetitively. This robustness is beneﬁcial for image rescaling in the wild when this cycle could be applied to one image for multiple times.It also performs well on tests with arbitrary large scales and asymmetric scales, even when the model is not trained with such tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted to demon-strate the superior performance of our model.
