Low-dimensional parametric models are the de-facto standard in computer vision for intrinsic camera calibra-tion. These models explicitly describe the mapping between incoming viewing rays and image pixels. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach which implicitly models the lens distortion. The main idea is to replace the parametric model with a regularization term that ensures the latent dis-tortion map varies smoothly throughout the image. The pro-posed model is effectively parameter-free and allows us to optimize the 6 degree-of-freedom camera pose without ex-plicitly knowing the intrinsic calibration. We show that the method is applicable to a wide selection of cameras with varying distortion and in multiple applications, such as vi-sual localization and structure-from-motion.
