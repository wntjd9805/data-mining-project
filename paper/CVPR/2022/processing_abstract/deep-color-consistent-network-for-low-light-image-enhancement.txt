Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) explores how to reﬁne the illumination and obtain natural normal-light im-ages. Current LLIE methods mainly focus on improving the illumination, but do not consider the color consistency by reasonably incorporating color information into the LLIE process. As a result, color difference usually exists between the enhanced image and ground-truth. To address this is-sue, we propose a new deep color consistent network termedDCC-Net to retain the color consistency for LLIE. A new“divide and conquer” collaborative strategy is presented, which can jointly preserve color information and enhance the illumination. Speciﬁcally, the decoupling strategy of ourDCC-Net decouples each color image into two main com-ponents, i.e., gray image plus color histogram. Gray image is used to generate reasonable structures and textures, and the color histogram is beneﬁcial for preserving the color consistency. That is, they both are utilized to complete theLLIE task collaboratively. To match the color and content features, and reduce the color consistency gap between en-hanced image and ground-truth, we also design a new pyra-mid color embedding (PCE) module, which can better em-bed color information into the LLIE process. Extensive ex-periments on six real datasets show that the enhanced im-ages of our DCC-Net are more natural and colorful, and perform favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.
