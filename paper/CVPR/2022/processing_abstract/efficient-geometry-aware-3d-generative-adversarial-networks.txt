Unsupervised generation of high-quality multi-view-consistent images and 3D shapes using only collections of single-view 2D photographs has been a long-standing chal-lenge. Existing 3D GANs are either compute-intensive or make approximations that are not 3D-consistent; the for-mer limits quality and resolution of the generated images and the latter adversely affects multi-view consistency and shape quality. In this work, we improve the computational efﬁciency and image quality of 3D GANs without overly relying on these approximations. We introduce an expres-sive hybrid explicit-implicit network architecture that, to-gether with other design choices, synthesizes not only high-resolution multi-view-consistent images in real time but also produces high-quality 3D geometry. By decoupling fea-ture generation and neural rendering, our framework is able to leverage state-of-the-art 2D CNN generators, such as StyleGAN2, and inherit their efﬁciency and expressive-ness. We demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D-aware synthesis with FFHQ and AFHQ Cats, among other experiments.
