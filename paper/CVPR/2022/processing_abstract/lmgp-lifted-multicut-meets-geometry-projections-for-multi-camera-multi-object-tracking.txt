Multi-Camera Multi-Object Tracking is currently draw-ing attention in the computer vision ﬁeld due to its supe-rior performance in real-world applications such as video surveillance with crowded scenes or in wide spaces. In this work, we propose a mathematically elegant multi-camera tracking approach based on a spatial-multiple object temporal lifted multicut formulation. Our model utilizes state-of-the-art tracklets produced by single-camera track-ers as proposals. As these tracklets may contain ID-Switch errors, we reﬁne them through a novel pre-clustering ob-tained from 3D geometry projections. As a result, we derive a better tracking graph without ID switches and more precise afﬁnity costs for the data association phase.Tracklets are then matched to multi-camera trajectories by solving a global lifted multicut formulation that incorpo-rates short and long-range temporal interactions on track-lets located in the same camera as well as inter-camera ones. Experimental results on the WildTrack dataset yield near-perfect performance, outperforming state-of-the-art trackers on Campus while being on par on the PETS-09 dataset. We will release our implementations at this link https://github.com/nhmduy/LMGP.
