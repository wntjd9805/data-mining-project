Vehicle trajectory prediction is nowadays a fundamen-tal pillar of self-driving cars. Both the industry and re-search communities have acknowledged the need for such a pillar by providing public benchmarks. While state-of-the-art methods are impressive, i.e., they have no off-road pre-diction, their generalization to cities outside of the bench-mark remains unexplored. In this work, we show that those methods do not generalize to new scenes. We present a method that automatically generates realistic scenes caus-ing state-of-the-art models to go off-road. We frame the problem through the lens of adversarial scene generation.The method is a simple yet effective generative model based on atomic scene generation functions along with physical constraints. Our experiments show that more than 60% of existing scenes from the current benchmarks can be modi-fied in a way to make prediction methods fail (i.e., predict-ing off-road). We further show that the generated scenes (i) are realistic since they do exist in the real world, and (ii) can be used to make existing models more robust, yielding 30 âˆ’ 40% reductions in the off-road rate.
