Ground TruthOursMip-NeRF [2]Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a popular view syn-thesis technique that represents a scene as a continuous volumetric function, parameterized by multilayer percep-trons that provide the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at each location. While NeRF-based tech-niques excel at representing fine geometric structures with smoothly varying view-dependent appearance, they often fail to accurately capture and reproduce the appearance of glossy surfaces. We address this limitation by introduc-ing Ref-NeRF, which replaces NeRF’s parameterization of view-dependent outgoing radiance with a representation of reflected radiance and structures this function using a col-lection of spatially-varying scene properties. We show that together with a regularizer on normal vectors, our model significantly improves the realism and accuracy of specular reflections. Furthermore, we show that our model’s inter-nal representation of outgoing radiance is interpretable and useful for scene editing.
