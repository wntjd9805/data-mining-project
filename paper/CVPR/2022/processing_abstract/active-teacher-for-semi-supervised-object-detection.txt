In this paper, we study teacher-student learning from the perspective of data initialization and propose a novel algo-rithm called Active Teacher1 for semi-supervised object de-tection (SSOD). Active Teacher extends the teacher-student framework to an iterative version, where the label set is partially initialized and gradually augmented by evaluat-ing three key factors of unlabeled examples, including dif-ficulty, information and diversity. With this design, ActiveTeacher can maximize the effect of limited label informa-tion while improving the quality of pseudo-labels. To vali-date our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on theMS-COCO benchmark and compare Active Teacher with a set of recently proposed SSOD methods. The experimental results not only validate the superior performance gain ofActive Teacher over the compared methods, but also show that it enables the baseline network, i.e., Faster-RCNN, to achieve 100% supervised performance with much less la-bel expenditure, i.e. 40% labeled examples on MS-COCO.More importantly, we believe that the experimental analy-ses in this paper can provide useful empirical knowledge for data annotation in practical applications.
