We study the problem of attribute compression for large-scale unstructured 3D point clouds. Through an in-depth exploration of the relationships between different encoding steps and different attribute channels, we introduce a deep compression network, termed 3DAC, to explicitly compress the attributes of 3D point clouds and reduce storage us-age in this paper. Speciﬁcally, the point cloud attributes such as color and reﬂectance are ﬁrstly converted to trans-form coefﬁcients. We then propose a deep entropy model to model the probabilities of these coefﬁcients by consider-ing information hidden in attribute transforms and previous encoded attributes. Finally, the estimated probabilities are used to further compress these transform coefﬁcients to aﬁnal attributes bitstream. Extensive experiments conducted on both indoor and outdoor large-scale open point cloud datasets, including ScanNet and SemanticKITTI, demon-strated the superior compression rates and reconstruction quality of the proposed method.
