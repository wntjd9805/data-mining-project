In dynamic scenes, images often suffer from dynamic blur due to superposition of motions or low signal-noise ratio resulted from quick shutter speed when avoiding mo-tions. Recovering sharp and clean results from the cap-tured images heavily depends on the ability of restoration methods and the quality of the input. Although existing re-search on image restoration focuses on developing models for obtaining better restored results, fewer have studied to evaluate how and which input image leads to superior re-stored quality. In this paper, to better study an imageâ€™s po-tential value that can be explored for restoration, we pro-pose a novel concept, referring to image restoration poten-tial (IRP). Specifically, We first establish a dynamic scene imaging dataset containing composite distortions and ap-plied image restoration processes to validate the rationality of the existence to IRP. Based on this dataset, we investigate several properties of IRP and propose a novel deep model to accurately predict IRP values. By gradually distilling and selective fusing the degradation features, the proposed model shows its superiority in IRP prediction. Thanks to the proposed model, we are then able to validate how various image restoration related applications are benefited fromIRP prediction. We show the potential usages of IRP as a filtering principle to select valuable frames, an auxiliary guidance to improve restoration models, and also an indica-tor to optimize camera settings for capturing better images under dynamic scenarios.
