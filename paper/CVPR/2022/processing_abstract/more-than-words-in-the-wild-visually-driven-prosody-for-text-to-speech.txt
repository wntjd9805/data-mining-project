In this paper we present VDTTS, a Visually-Driven Text-to-Speech model. Motivated by dubbing, VDTTS takes ad-vantage of video frames as an additional input alongside text, and generates speech that matches the video signal.We demonstrate how this allows VDTTS to, unlike plain TTS models, generate speech that not only has prosodic varia-tions like natural pauses and pitch, but is also synchronized to the input video.Experimentally, we show our model produces well-synchronized outputs, approaching the video-speech syn-chronization quality of the ground-truth, on several chal-lenging benchmarks including “in-the-wild” content fromVoxCeleb2.Supplementary demo videos demonstrating video-speech synchronization, robustness to speaker ID swapping, and prosody, presented at the project page.1
