Predictive learning ideally builds the world model of physical processes in one or more given environments. Typ-ical setups assume that we can collect data from all environ-ments at all times. In practice, however, different prediction tasks may arrive sequentially so that the environments may change persistently throughout the training procedure. Can we develop predictive learning algorithms that can deal with more realistic, non-stationary physical environments?In this paper, we study a new continual learning problem in the context of video prediction, and observe that most ex-isting methods suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in this setup. To tackle this problem, we propose the continual predictive learning (CPL) approach, which learns a mix-ture world model via predictive experience replay and per-forms test-time adaptation with non-parametric task infer-ence. We construct two new benchmarks based on RoboNet and KTH, in which different tasks correspond to different physical robotic environments or human actions. Our ap-proach is shown to effectively mitigate forgetting and re-markably outperform the na¨ıve combinations of previous art in video prediction and continual learning.
