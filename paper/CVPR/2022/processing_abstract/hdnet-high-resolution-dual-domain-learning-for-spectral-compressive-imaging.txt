The rapid development of deep learning provides a bet-ter solution for the end-to-end reconstruction of hyperspec-tral image (HSI). However, existing learning-based meth-ods have two major defects. Firstly, networks with self-attention usually sacrifice internal resolution to balance model performance against complexity, losing fine-grained high-resolution (HR) features. Secondly, even if the op-timization focusing on spatial-spectral domain learning (SDL) converges to the ideal solution, there is still a signif-icant visual difference between the reconstructed HSI and the truth. So we propose a high-resolution dual-domain learning network (HDNet) for HSI reconstruction. On the one hand, the proposed HR spatial-spectral attention mod-ule with its efficient feature fusion provides continuous and fine pixel-level features. On the other hand, frequency do-main learning (FDL) is introduced for HSI reconstruction to narrow the frequency domain discrepancy. Dynamic FDL supervision forces the model to reconstruct fine-grained fre-quencies and compensate for excessive smoothing and dis-tortion caused by pixel-level losses. The HR pixel-level at-tention and frequency-level refinement in our HDNet mutu-ally promote HSI perceptual quality. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method achievesSOTA performance on simulated and real HSI datasets. https://github.com/Huxiaowan/HDNet
