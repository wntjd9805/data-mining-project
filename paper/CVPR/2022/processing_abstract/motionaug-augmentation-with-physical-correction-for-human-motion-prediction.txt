This paper presents a motion data augmentation scheme incorporating motion synthesis encouraging di-versity and motion correction imposing physical plau-sibility. This motion synthesis consists of our modifiedVariational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Inverse Kinemat-ics (IK). In this VAE, our proposed sampling-near-samples method generates various valid motions even with insufficient training motion data. Our IK-based motion synthesis method allows us to generate a va-riety of motions semi-automatically. Since these two schemes generate unrealistic artifacts in the synthe-sized motions, our motion correction rectifies them.This motion correction scheme consists of imitation learning with physics simulation and subsequent mo-tion debiasing. For this imitation learning, we pro-pose the PD-residual force that significantly acceler-ates the training process. Furthermore, our motion debiasing successfully offsets the motion bias induced by imitation learning to maximize the effect of aug-mentation. As a result, our method outperforms pre-vious noise-based motion augmentation methods by a large margin on both Recurrent Neural Network-based and Graph Convolutional Network-based human mo-tion prediction models.
