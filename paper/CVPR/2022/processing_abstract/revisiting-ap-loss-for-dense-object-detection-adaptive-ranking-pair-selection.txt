Average precision (AP) loss has recently shown promis-ing performance on the dense object detection task. How-ever, a deep understanding of how AP loss affects the detec-tor from a pairwise ranking perspective has not yet been de-veloped. In this work, we revisit the average precision (AP) loss and reveal that the crucial element is that of select-ing the ranking pairs between positive and negative sam-ples. Based on this observation, we propose two strate-gies to improve the AP loss. The ﬁrst of these is a novelAdaptive Pairwise Error (APE) loss that focusing on rank-ing pairs in both positive and negative samples. Moreover, we select more accurate ranking pairs by exploiting the normalized ranking scores and localization scores with a clustering algorithm. Experiments conducted on the MS-COCO dataset support our analysis and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with current classiﬁcation and ranking loss.
