We present an approach for 3D global human mesh re-covery from monocular videos recorded with dynamic cam-eras. Our approach is robust to severe and long-term occlu-sions and tracks human bodies even when they go outside the camera’s ﬁeld of view. To achieve this, we ﬁrst propose a deep generative motion inﬁller, which autoregressively in-ﬁlls the body motions of occluded humans based on visi-ble motions. Additionally, in contrast to prior work, our approach reconstructs human meshes in consistent global coordinates even with dynamic cameras. Since the joint re-construction of human motions and camera poses is under-constrained, we propose a global trajectory predictor that generates global human trajectories based on local body movements. Using the predicted trajectories as anchors, we present a global optimization framework that reﬁnes the predicted trajectories and optimizes the camera poses to match the video evidence such as 2D keypoints. Experi-ments on challenging indoor and in-the-wild datasets with dynamic cameras demonstrate that the proposed approach*Work done during an internship at NVIDIA. outperforms prior methods signiﬁcantly in terms of motion inﬁlling and global mesh recovery.
