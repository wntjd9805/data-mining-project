Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (ReID) has been extensively investigated to mitigate the ad-verse effects of domain gaps. Those works assume the tar-get domain data can be accessible all at once. However, for the real-world streaming data, this hinders the timely adap-tation to changing data statistics and sufficient exploita-tion of increasing samples. In this paper, to address more practical scenarios, we propose a new task, Lifelong Un-supervised Domain Adaptive (LUDA) person ReID. This is challenging because it requires the model to continuously adapt to unlabeled data in the target environments while alleviating catastrophic forgetting for such a fine-grained person retrieval task. We design an effective scheme for this task, dubbed CLUDA-ReID, where the anti-forgetting is harmoniously coordinated with the adaptation. Specif-ically, a meta-based Coordinated Data Replay strategy is proposed to replay old data and update the network with a coordinated optimization direction for both adaptation and memorization. Moreover, we propose Relational Con-sistency Learning for old knowledge distillation/inheritance in line with the objective of retrieval-based tasks. We set up two evaluation settings to simulate the practical application scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effective-ness of our CLUDA-ReID for both scenarios with stationary target streams and scenarios with dynamic target streams.
