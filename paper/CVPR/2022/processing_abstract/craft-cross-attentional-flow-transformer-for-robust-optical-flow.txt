Sintel (Clean)Sintel (Final)Optical ﬂow estimation aims to ﬁnd the 2D motion ﬁeld by identifying corresponding pixels between two images.Despite the tremendous progress of deep learning-based optical ﬂow methods, it remains a challenge to accurately estimate large displacements with motion blur. This is mainly because the correlation volume, the basis of pixel matching, is computed as the dot product of the convolu-tional features of the two images. The locality of convo-lutional features makes the computed correlations suscep-tible to various noises. On large displacements with mo-tion blur, noisy correlations could cause severe errors in the estimated ﬂow. To overcome this challenge, we pro-pose a new architecture “CRoss-Attentional Flow Trans-former” (CRAFT), aiming to revitalize the correlation vol-ume computation. In CRAFT, a Semantic Smoothing Trans-former layer transforms the features of one frame, mak-ing them more global and semantically stable.In addi-tion, the dot-product correlations are replaced with trans-former Cross-Frame Attention. This layer ﬁlters out feature noises through the Query and Key projections, and com-putes more accurate correlations. On Sintel (Final) andKITTI (foreground) benchmarks, CRAFT has achieved new state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, to test the robust-ness of different models on large motions, we designed an image shifting attack that shifts input images to generate large artiﬁcial motions. Under this attack, CRAFT per-forms much more robustly than two representative meth-ods, RAFT and GMA. The code of CRAFT is is available at https://github.com/askerlee/craft.
