Label assignment (LA), which aims to assign each train-ing sample a positive (pos) and a negative (neg) loss weight, plays an important role in object detection. Existing LA methods mostly focus on the design of pos weighting func-tion, while the neg weight is directly derived from the pos weight. Such a mechanism limits the learning capacity of detectors.In this paper, we explore a new weighting paradigm, termed dual weighting (DW), to specify pos and neg weights separately. We first identify the key influential factors of pos/neg weights by analyzing the evaluation met-rics in object detection, and then design the pos and neg weighting functions based on them. Specifically, the pos weight of a sample is determined by the consistency degree between its classification and localization scores, while the neg weight is decomposed into two terms: the probabil-ity that it is a neg sample and its importance conditioned on being a neg sample. Such a weighting strategy offers greater flexibility to distinguish between important and less important samples, resulting in a more effective object de-tector. Equipped with the proposed DW method, a singleFCOS-ResNet-50 detector can reach 41.5% mAP on COCO under 1Ã— schedule, outperforming other existing LA meth-ods.It consistently improves the baselines on COCO by a large margin under various backbones without bells and whistles.
