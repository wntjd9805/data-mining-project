Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to rec-ognize unseen compositions formed from seen state and ob-ject during training. Since the same state may be various in the visual appearance while entangled with different ob-jects, CZSL is still a challenging task. Some methods recog-nize state and object with two trained classiﬁers, ignoring the impact of the interaction between object and state; the other methods try to learn the joint representation of the state-object compositions, leading to the domain gap be-tween seen and unseen composition sets. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Contrastive Embedding Network (SCEN)1 for unseen composition recognition. Considering the entanglement between state and object, we embed the visual feature into a Siamese Contrastive Space to capture prototypes of them separately, alleviating the interactionIn addition, we design a State between state and object.Transition Module (STM) to increase the diversity of train-ing compositions, improving the robustness of the recogni-tion model. Extensive experiments indicate that our method signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on three challenging benchmark datasets, including the recent proposed C-QGA dataset.
