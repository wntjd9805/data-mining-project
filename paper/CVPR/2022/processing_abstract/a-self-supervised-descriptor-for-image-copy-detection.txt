Image copy detection is an important task for content moderation. We introduce SSCD, a model that builds on a recent self-supervised contrastive training objective. We adapt this method to the copy detection task by changing the architecture and training objective, including a pooling op-erator from the instance matching literature, and adapting contrastive learning to augmentations that combine images.Our approach relies on an entropy regularization term, promoting consistent separation between descriptor vec-tors, and we demonstrate that this signiﬁcantly improves copy detection accuracy. Our method produces a compact descriptor vector, suitable for real-world web scale appli-cations. Statistical information from a background image distribution can be incorporated into the descriptor.On the recent DISC2021 benchmark, SSCD is shown to outperform both baseline copy detection models and self-supervised architectures designed for image classiﬁcation by huge margins, in all settings. For example, SSCD out-performs SimCLR descriptors by 48% absolute.Code is available at https : / / github . com / facebookresearch/sscd-copy-detection.
