For image segmentation, the current standard is to per-form pixel-level optimization and inference in Euclidean output embedding spaces through linear hyperplanes.In this work, we show that hyperbolic manifolds provide a valuable alternative for image segmentation and propose a tractable formulation of hierarchical pixel-level classiﬁca-tion in hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic Image Segmentation opens up new possibilities and practical beneﬁts for seg-mentation, such as uncertainty estimation and boundary in-formation for free, zero-label generalization, and increased performance in low-dimensional output embeddings.
