Class 1Points (clean labels)Points (wrong labels)ClassiﬁerClass 1ClassiﬁerDeep neural networks are able to memorize noisy labels easily with a softmax cross entropy (CE) loss. Previous studies attempted to address this issue focus on incorpo-rating a noise-robust loss function to the CE loss. However, the memorization issue is alleviated but still remains due to the non-robust CE loss. To address this issue, we fo-cus on learning robust contrastive representations of data on which the classiﬁer is hard to memorize the label noise under the CE loss. We propose a novel contrastive regu-larization function to learn such representations over noisy data where label noise does not dominate the representation learning. By theoretically investigating the representations induced by the proposed regularization function, we reveal that the learned representations keep information related to true labels and discard information related to corrupted la-bels. Moreover, our theoretical results also indicate that the learned representations are robust to the label noise. The ef-fectiveness of this method is demonstrated with experiments on benchmark datasets.
