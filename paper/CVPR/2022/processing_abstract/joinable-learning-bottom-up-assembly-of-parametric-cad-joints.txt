Physical products are often complex assemblies combin-ing a multitude of 3D parts modeled in computer-aided de-sign (CAD) software. CAD designers build up these assem-blies by aligning individual parts to one another using con-straints called joints. In this paper we introduce JoinABLe, a learning-based method that assembles parts together to form joints. JoinABLe uses the weak supervision available in standard parametric CAD files without the help of object class labels or human guidance. Our results show that by making network predictions over a graph representation of solid models we can outperform multiple baseline methods with an accuracy (79.53%) that approaches human perfor-mance (80%). Finally, to support future research we release the Fusion 360 Gallery assembly dataset, containing as-semblies with rich information on joints, contact surfaces, holes, and the underlying assembly graph structure.
