We present a scalable combinatorial algorithm for glob-ally optimizing over the space of geometrically consistent mappings between 3D shapes. We use the mathemati-cally elegant formalism proposed by Windheuser et al. [66] where 3D shape matching was formulated as an integer lin-ear program over the space of orientation-preserving dif-feomorphisms. Until now, the resulting formulation had limited practical applicability due to its complicated con-straint structure and its large size. We propose a novel pri-mal heuristic coupled with a Lagrange dual problem that is several orders of magnitudes faster compared to previ-ous solvers. This allows us to handle shapes with substan-tially more triangles than previously solvable. We demon-strate compelling results on diverse datasets, and, even showcase that we can address the challenging setting of matching two partial shapes without availability of com-plete shapes.
