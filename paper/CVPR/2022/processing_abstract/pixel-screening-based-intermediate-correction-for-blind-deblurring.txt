Blind deblurring has attracted much interest with its wide applications in reality. The blind deblurring problem is usually solved by estimating the intermediate kernel and the intermediate image alternatively, which will finally con-verge to the blurring kernel of the observed image. Nu-merous works have been proposed to obtain intermediate images with fewer undesirable artifacts by designing deli-cate regularization on the latent solution. However, these methods still fail while dealing with images containing sat-urations and large blurs. To address this problem, we pro-pose an intermediate image correction method which uti-lizes Bayes posterior estimation to screen through the in-termediate image and exclude those unfavorable pixels to reduce their influence for kernel estimation. Extensive ex-periments have proved that the proposed method can ef-fectively improve the accuracy of the final derived kernel against the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by both quantitative and qualitative comparisons.
