The success of deep learning methods relies on the avail-ability of well-labeled large-scale datasets. However, for medical images, annotating such abundant training data of-ten requires experienced radiologists and consumes their limited time. Few-shot learning is developed to alleviate this burden, which achieves competitive performances with only several labeled data. However, a crucial yet previ-ously overlooked problem in few-shot learning is about the selection of template images for annotation before learn-ing, which affects the final performance. We herein propose a novel Sample Choosing Policy (SCP) to select “the most worthy” images for annotation, in the context of few-shot medical landmark detection. SCP consists of three parts: 1) Self-supervised training for building a pre-trained deep model to extract features from radiological images, 2) KeyPoint Proposal for localizing informative patches, and 3)Representative Score Estimation for searching the most rep-resentative samples or templates. The advantage of SCP is demonstrated by various experiments on three widely-used public datasets. For one-shot medical landmark de-tection, its use reduces the mean radial errors on Cephalo-metric and HandXray datasets by 14.2% (from 3.595mm to 3.083mm) and 35.5% (4.114mm to 2.653mm), respectively.
