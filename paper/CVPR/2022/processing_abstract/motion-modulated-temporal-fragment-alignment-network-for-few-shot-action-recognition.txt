While the majority of FSL models focus on image classi-ﬁcation, the extension to action recognition is rather chal-lenging due to the additional temporal dimension in videos.To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end Motion-modulated Temporal Fragment Alignment Network (MT-FAN) by jointly exploring the task-speciﬁc motion modu-lation and the multi-level temporal fragment alignment forFew-Shot Action Recognition (FSAR). The proposed MT-FAN model enjoys several merits. First, we design a mo-tion modulator conditioned on the learned task-speciﬁc mo-tion embeddings, which can activate the channels related to the task-shared motion patterns for each frame. Second, a segment attention mechanism is proposed to automati-cally discover the higher-level segments for multi-level tem-poral fragment alignment, which encompasses the frame-to-frame, segment-to-segment, and segment-to-frame align-ments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to exploit task-speciﬁc motion modulation for FSAR. Extensive experimental results on four standard benchmarks demon-strate that the proposed model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art FSAR methods.
