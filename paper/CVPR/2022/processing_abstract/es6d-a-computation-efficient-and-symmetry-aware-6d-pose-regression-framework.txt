In this paper, a computation efficient regression frame-work is presented for estimating the 6D pose of rigid objects from a single RGB-D image, which is applica-ble to handling symmetric objects.This framework is designed in a simple architecture that efficiently extracts point-wise features from RGB-D data using a fully con-volutional network, called XYZNet, and directly regresses the 6D pose without any post refinement.In the case of symmetric object, one object has multiple ground-truth poses, and this one-to-many relationship may lead to esti-In order to solve this ambiguity prob-mation ambiguity. lem, we design a symmetry-invariant pose distance metric, called average (maximum) grouped primitives distance orA(M)GPD. The proposed A(M)GPD loss can make the re-gression network converge to the correct state, i.e., all min-ima in the A(M)GPD loss surface are mapped to the cor-rect poses. Extensive experiments on YCB-Video and T-LESS datasets demonstrate the proposed framework’s sub-stantially superior performance in top accuracy and low computational cost.The relevant code is available in https://github.com/GANWANSHUI/ES6D.git.Figure 1. Comparison of A(M)GPD and ADD-S. Axis X shows the rotation angle of the object (from 0° to 360°). Axis Y shows the calculated distance. We set the initial pose as the ground truth.As we can see, all minima are mapped to correct poses in theA(M)GPD curve and several minima point to incorrect poses in the ADD-S curve.
