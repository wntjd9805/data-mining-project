Due to the visual ambiguity, purely kinematic formula-tions on monocular human motion capture are often phys-ically incorrect, biomechanically implausible, and can not reconstruct accurate interactions. In this work, we focus on exploiting the high-precision and non-differentiable physics simulator to incorporate dynamical constraints in motion capture. Our key-idea is to use real physical supervisions to train a target pose distribution prior for sampling-based motion control to capture physically plausible human mo-tion. To obtain accurate reference motion with terrain in-teractions for the sampling, we first introduce an interac-tion constraint based on SDF (Signed Distance Field) to enforce appropriate ground contact modeling. We then de-sign a novel two-branch decoder to avoid stochastic er-ror from pseudo ground-truth and train a distribution prior with the non-differentiable physics simulator. Finally, we regress the sampling distribution from the current state of the physical character with the trained prior and sample satisfied target poses to track the estimated reference mo-tion. Qualitative and quantitative results show that we can obtain physically plausible human motion with complex ter-rain interactions, human shape variations, and diverse be-haviors.
