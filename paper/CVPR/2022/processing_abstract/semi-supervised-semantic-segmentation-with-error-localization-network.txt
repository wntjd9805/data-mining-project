This paper studies semi-supervised learning of seman-tic segmentation, which assumes that only a small portion of training images are labeled and the others remain unla-beled. The unlabeled images are usually assigned pseudo labels to be used in training, which however often causes the risk of performance degradation due to the confirma-tion bias towards errors on the pseudo labels. We present a novel method that resolves this chronic issue of pseudo labeling. At the heart of our method lies error localiza-tion network (ELN), an auxiliary module that takes an im-age and its segmentation prediction as input and identifies pixels whose pseudo labels are likely to be wrong. ELN enables semi-supervised learning to be robust against in-accurate pseudo labels by disregarding label noises during training and can be naturally integrated with self-training and contrastive learning. Moreover, we introduce a new learning strategy for ELN that simulates plausible and di-verse segmentation errors during training of ELN to en-hance its generalization. Our method is evaluated on PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, where it outperforms all existing methods in every evaluation setting.
