Semi-supervised semantic segmentation learns from small amounts of labelled images and large amounts of un-labelled images, which has witnessed impressive progress with the recent advance of deep neural networks. How-ever, it often suffers from severe class-bias problem while exploring the unlabelled images, largely due to the clear pixel-wise class imbalance in the labelled images. This paper presents an unbiased subclass regularization net-work (USRN) that alleviates the class imbalance issue by learning class-unbiased segmentation from balanced sub-class distributions. We build the balanced subclass dis-tributions by clustering pixels of each original class into multiple subclasses of similar sizes, which provide class-balanced pseudo supervision to regularize the class-biased segmentation.In addition, we design an entropy-based gate mechanism to coordinate learning between the orig-inal classes and the clustered subclasses which facilitates subclass regularization effectively by suppressing unconfi-dent subclass predictions. Extensive experiments over mul-tiple public benchmarks show that USRN achieves superior performance as compared with the state-of-the-art.Figure 1. Motivation of our work: In semi-supervised seman-tic segmentation, the segmentation model trained using class-imbalanced labels (of the labelled data) tends to produce class-biased segmentation on the unlabelled data. We create class-balanced clusters with balanced subclass distribution, learning from which alleviates the class imbalance issue and produces class-unbiased segmentation on the unlabelled data. We obtain the class-balanced clusters by clustering pixels of each original class into multiple subclasses of similar size. Best viewed in color.
