Point cloud completion aims at completing geometric and topological shapes from a partial observation. How-ever, some topology of the original shape is missing, exist-ing methods directly predict the location of complete points, without predicting structured and topological information of the complete shape, which leads to inferior performance.To better tackle the missing topology part, we proposeLAKe-Net, a novel topology-aware point cloud comple-tion model by localizing aligned keypoints, with a novelKeypoints-Skeleton-Shape prediction manner. Specifically, our method completes missing topology using three steps: 1) Aligned Keypoint Localization. An asymmetric keypoint locator, including an unsupervised multi-scale keypoint de-tector and a complete keypoint generator, is proposed for lo-calizing aligned keypoints from complete and partial point clouds. We theoretically prove that the detector can cap-ture aligned keypoints for objects within a sub-category. 2) Surface-skeleton Generation. A new type of skeleton, named Surface-skeleton, is generated from keypoints based on geometric priors to fully represent the topological infor-mation captured from keypoints and better recover the local details. 3) Shape Refinement. We design a refinement sub-net where multi-scale surface-skeletons are fed into each recursive skeleton-assisted refinement module to assist the completion process. Experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on point cloud completion.
