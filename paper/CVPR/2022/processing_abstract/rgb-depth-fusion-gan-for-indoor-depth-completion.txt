The raw depth image captured by the indoor depth sen-sor usually has an extensive range of missing depth values due to inherent limitations such as the inability to perceive transparent objects and limited distance range. The incom-plete depth map burdens many downstream vision tasks, and a rising number of depth completion methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue. While most existing meth-ods can generate accurate dense depth maps from sparse and uniformly sampled depth maps, they are not suitable for complementing the large contiguous regions of missing depth values, which is common and critical. In this paper, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network, which takes a pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to predict a dense and completed depth map. The ﬁrst branch employs an encoder-decoder structure to regress the local dense depth values from the raw depth map, with the help of local guidance information extracted from the RGB image. In the other branch, we propose an RGB-depth fu-sion GAN to transfer the RGB image to the ﬁne-grained tex-tured depth map. We adopt adaptive fusion modules namedW-AdaIN to propagate the features across the two branches, and we append a conﬁdence fusion head to fuse the two out-puts of the branches for the ﬁnal depth map. Extensive ex-periments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate that our proposed method clearly improves the depth com-pletion performance, especially in a more realistic setting of indoor environments with the help of the pseudo depth map.
