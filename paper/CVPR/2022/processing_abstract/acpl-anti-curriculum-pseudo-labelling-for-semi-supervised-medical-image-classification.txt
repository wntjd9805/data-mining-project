Effective semi-supervised learning (SSL) in medical im-age analysis (MIA) must address two challenges: 1) work effectively on both multi-class (e.g., lesion classification) and multi-label (e.g., multiple-disease diagnosis) problems, and 2) handle imbalanced learning (because of the high variance in disease prevalence). One strategy to explore in SSL MIA is based on the pseudo labelling strategy, but it has a few shortcomings. Pseudo-labelling has in general lower accuracy than consistency learning, it is not specifi-cally design for both multi-class and multi-label problems, and it can be challenged by imbalanced learning. In this pa-per, unlike traditional methods that select confident pseudo label by threshold, we propose a new SSL algorithm, called anti-curriculum pseudo-labelling (ACPL), which introduces novel techniques to select informative unlabelled samples, improving training balance and allowing the model to work for both multi-label and multi-class problems, and to esti-mate pseudo labels by an accurate ensemble of classifiers (improving pseudo label accuracy). We run extensive ex-periments to evaluate ACPL on two public medical image classification benchmarks: Chest X-Ray14 for thorax dis-ease multi-label classification and ISIC2018 for skin lesion multi-class classification. Our method outperforms previ-ous SOTA SSL methods on both datasets12.
