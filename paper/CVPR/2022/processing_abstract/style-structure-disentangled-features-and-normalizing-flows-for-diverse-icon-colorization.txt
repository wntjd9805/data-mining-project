We present a colorization network that generates flat-color icons according to given sketches and semantic col-orization styles. Our network contains a style-structure dis-entangled colorization module and a normalizing flow. The colorization module transforms a paired sketch image and style image into a flat-color icon. To enhance network gen-eralization and the quality of icons, we present a pixel-wise decoder, a global style code, and a contour loss to reduce color gradients at flat regions and increase color disconti-nuity at boundaries. The normalizing flow maps Gaussian vectors to diverse style codes conditioned on the given se-mantic colorization label. This conditional sampling en-ables users to control attributes and obtain diverse col-orization results. Compared to previous methods built upon conditional generative adversarial networks, our approach enjoys the advantages of both high image quality and di-versity. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compared the flat-color icons generated by our approach and recent coloriza-tion and image-to-image translation methods on various conditions. Experiment results verify that our method out-performs state-of-the-arts qualitatively and quantitatively.
