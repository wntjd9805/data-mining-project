Continual learning is a challenging real-world problem for constructing a mature AI system when data are provided in a streaming fashion. Despite recent progress in contin-ual classification, the researches of continual object detec-tion are impeded by the diverse sizes and numbers of ob-jects in each image. Different from previous works that tune the whole network for all tasks, in this work, we present a simple and flexible framework for continual object de-tection via pRotOtypical taSk corrElaTion guided gaTing mechAnism (ROSETTA). Concretely, a unified framework is shared by all tasks while task-aware gates are intro-duced to automatically select sub-models for specific tasks.In this way, various knowledge can be successively mem-orized by storing their corresponding sub-model weights in this system. To make ROSETTA automatically deter-mine which experience is available and useful, a proto-typical task correlation guided Gating Diversity Controller (GDC) is introduced to adaptively adjust the diversity of gates for the new task based on class-specific prototypes.GDC module computes class-to-class correlation matrix to depict the cross-task correlation, and hereby activates more exclusive gates for the new task if a significant domain gap is observed. Comprehensive experiments on COCO-VOC,KITTI-Kitchen, class-incremental detection on VOC and se-quential learning of four tasks show that ROSETTA yields state-of-the-art performance on both task-based and class-based continual object detection. 1
