Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to localize actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Most existing methods address this problem with a“localization-by-classiﬁcation” pipeline that localizes ac-tion regions based on snippet-wise classiﬁcation sequences.Snippet-wise classiﬁcations are unfortunately error prone due to the sparsity of video-level labels. Inspired by recent success in unsupervised contrastive representation learn-ing, we propose a novel denoised cross-video contrastive al-gorithm, aiming to enhance the feature discrimination abil-ity of video snippets for accurate temporal action localiza-tion in the weakly-supervised setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) an effective pseudo-label denoising module to alleviate the side effects caused by noisy con-trastive features, 2) an efﬁcient region-level feature con-trast strategy with a region-level memory bank to capture“global” contrast across the entire dataset, and 3) a diverse contrastive learning strategy to enable action-background separation as well as intra-class compactness & inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 andActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.
