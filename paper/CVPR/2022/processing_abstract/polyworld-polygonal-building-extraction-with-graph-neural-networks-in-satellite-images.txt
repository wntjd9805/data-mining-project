While most state-of-the-art instance segmentation meth-ods produce binary segmentation masks, geographic and cartographic applications typically require precise vector polygons of extracted objects instead of rasterized output.This paper introduces PolyWorld, a neural network that di-rectly extracts building vertices from an image and connects them correctly to create precise polygons. The model pre-dicts the connection strength between each pair of vertices using a graph neural network and estimates the assign-ments by solving a differentiable optimal transport problem.Moreover, the vertex positions are optimized by minimiz-ing a combined segmentation and polygonal angle differ-ence loss. PolyWorld signiÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the state of the art in building polygonization and achieves not only no-table quantitative results, but also produces visually pleas-ing building polygons.
