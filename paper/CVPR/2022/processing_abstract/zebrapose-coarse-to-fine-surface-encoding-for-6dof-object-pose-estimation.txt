Establishing correspondences from image to 3D has been a key task of 6DoF object pose estimation for a long time. To predict pose more accurately, deeply learned dense maps replaced sparse templates. Dense methods also im-proved pose estimation in the presence of occlusion. More recently researchers have shown improvements by learning object fragments as segmentation. In this work, we present a discrete descriptor, which can represent the object surface densely. By incorporating a hierarchical binary grouping, we can encode the object surface very efficiently. Moreover, we propose a coarse to fine training strategy, which enables fine-grained correspondence prediction. Finally, by match-ing predicted codes with object surface and using a PnP solver, we estimate the 6DoF pose. Results on the publicLM-O and YCB-V datasets show major improvement over the state of the art w.r.t. ADD(-S) metric, even surpassingRGB-D based methods in some cases.Figure 1. ZebraPose assigns a discrete code to each surface ver-tex hierarchically. We project the code as binary black and white values (top) and learn them using deep neural networks. Our bi-nary descriptor allows one-to-one correspondence for the problem of 6DoF object pose efficiently.
