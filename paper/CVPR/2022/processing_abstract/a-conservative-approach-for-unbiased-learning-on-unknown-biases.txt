Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art in image classification, recent works ad-dress their unreliable predictions due to their excessive de-pendence on biased training data. Existing unbiased mod-eling postulates that the bias in the dataset is obvious to know, but it is actually unsuited for image datasets includ-ing countless sensory attributes. To mitigate this issue, we present a new scenario that does not necessitate a pre-defined bias. Under the observation that CNNs do have multi-variant and unbiased representations in the model, we propose a conservative framework that employs this in-ternal information for unbiased learning. Specifically, this mechanism is implemented via hierarchical features cap-tured along the multiple layers and orthogonal regulariza-tion. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demon-strate our method is effective for unbiased learning.1
