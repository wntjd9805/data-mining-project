Recognition in low quality face datasets is challenging because facial attributes are obscured and degraded. Ad-vances in margin-based loss functions have resulted in en-hanced discriminability of faces in the embedding space.Further, previous studies have studied the effect of adap-tive losses to assign more importance to misclassified (hard) examples.In this work, we introduce another aspect of adaptiveness in the loss function, namely the image quality.We argue that the strategy to emphasize misclassified sam-ples should be adjusted according to their image quality.Specifically, the relative importance of easy or hard sam-ples should be based on the sampleâ€™s image quality. We propose a new loss function that emphasizes samples of dif-ferent difficulties based on their image quality. Our method achieves this in the form of an adaptive margin function by approximating the image quality with feature norms. Ex-tensive experiments show that our method, AdaFace, im-proves the face recognition performance over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) on four datasets (IJB-B, IJB-C, IJB-S andTinyFace).
