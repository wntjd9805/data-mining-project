Despite the promising progress having been made, the two challenges of multi-view clustering (MVC) are still waiting for better solutions: i) Most existing methods are either not qualified or require additional steps for incom-plete multi-view clustering and ii) noise or outliers might significantly degrade the overall clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework for in-complete and complete MVC named multi-view probabilis-tic clustering (MPC). MPC equivalently transforms multi-view pairwise posterior matching probability into compo-sition of each view’s individual distribution, which toler-ates data missing and might extend to any number of views.Then graph-context-aware refinement with path propaga-tion and co-neighbor propagation is used to refine pair-wise probability, which alleviates the impact of noise and outliers. Finally, MPC also equivalently transforms prob-abilistic clustering’s objective to avoid complete pairwise computation and adjusts clustering assignments by maxi-mizing joint probability iteratively. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks for incomplete and complete MVC show that MPC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.
