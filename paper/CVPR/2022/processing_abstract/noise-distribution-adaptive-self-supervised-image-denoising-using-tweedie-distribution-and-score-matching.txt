Tweedie distributions are a special case of exponential dispersion models, which are often used in classical statis-tics as distributions for generalized linear models. Here, we show that Tweedie distributions also play key roles in modern deep learning era, leading to a distribution adap-tive self-supervised image denoising formula without clean reference images. Specifically, by combining with the recentNoise2Score self-supervised image denoising approach and the saddle point approximation of Tweedie distribution, we provide a general closed-form denoising formula that can be used for large classes of noise distributions without ever knowing the underlying noise distribution. Similar to the original Noise2Score, the new approach is composed of two successive steps: score matching using perturbed noisy im-ages, followed by a closed form image denoising formula via distribution-independent Tweedieâ€™s formula.In addi-tion, we reveal a systematic algorithm to estimate the noise model and noise parameters for a given noisy image data set. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately estimate noise mod-els and parameters, and provide the state-of-the-art self-supervised image denoising performance in the benchmark dataset and real-world dataset.
