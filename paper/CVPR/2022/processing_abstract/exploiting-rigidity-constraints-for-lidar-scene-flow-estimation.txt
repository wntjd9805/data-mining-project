Previous LiDAR scene flow estimation methods, espe-cially recurrent neural networks, usually suffer from struc-ture distortion in challenging cases, such as sparse reflec-In this paper, we propose a tion and motion occlusions. novel optimization method based on a recurrent neural net-work to predict LiDAR scene flow in a weakly supervised manner. Specifically, our neural recurrent network exploits direct rigidity constraints to preserve the geometric struc-ture of the warped source scene during an iterative align-ment procedure. An error awarded optimization strategy is proposed to update the LiDAR scene flow by minimizing the point measurement error instead of reconstructing the cost volume multiple times. Trained on two autonomous driving datasets, our network outperforms recent state-of-the-art networks on lidarKITTI by a large margin.
