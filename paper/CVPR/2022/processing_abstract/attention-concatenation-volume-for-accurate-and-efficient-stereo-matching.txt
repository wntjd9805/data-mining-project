Stereo matching is a fundamental building block for many vision and robotics applications. An informative and concise cost volume representation is vital for stereo matching of high accuracy and efficiency.In this paper, we present a novel cost volume construction method which generates attention weights from correlation clues to sup-press redundant information and enhance matching-related information in the concatenation volume. To generate re-liable attention weights, we propose multi-level adaptive patch matching to improve the distinctiveness of the match-ing cost at different disparities even for textureless regions.The proposed cost volume is named attention concatena-tion volume (ACV) which can be seamlessly embedded into most stereo matching networks, the resulting networks can use a more lightweight aggregation network and meanwhile achieve higher accuracy, e.g. using only 1/25 parameters of the aggregation network can achieve higher accuracy forGwcNet. Furthermore, we design a highly accurate net-work (ACVNet) based on our ACV, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.
