Two-stage and query-based instance segmentation meth-ods have achieved remarkable results. However, their seg-mented masks are still very coarse. In this paper, we presentMask Transfiner for high-quality and efficient instance seg-mentation. Instead of operating on regular dense tensors, our Mask Transfiner decomposes and represents the image regions as a quadtree. Our transformer-based approach only processes detected error-prone tree nodes and self-corrects their errors in parallel. While these sparse pix-els only constitute a small proportion of the total number, they are critical to the final mask quality. This allows MaskTransfiner to predict highly accurate instance masks, at a low computational cost. Extensive experiments demon-strate that Mask Transfiner outperforms current instance segmentation methods on three popular benchmarks, signif-icantly improving both two-stage and query-based frame-works by a large margin of +3.0 mask AP on COCO andBDD100K, and +6.6 boundary AP on Cityscapes.
