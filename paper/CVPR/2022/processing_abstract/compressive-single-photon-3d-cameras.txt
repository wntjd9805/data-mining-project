Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerg-ing pixel technology for time-of-flight (ToF) 3D cameras that can capture the time-of-arrival of individual photons at picosecond resolution. To estimate depths, current SPAD-based 3D cameras measure the round-trip time of a laser pulse by building a per-pixel histogram of photon times-tamps. As the spatial and timestamp resolution of SPAD-based cameras increase, their output data rates far ex-ceed the capacity of existing data transfer technologies.One major reason for SPADâ€™s bandwidth-intensive oper-ation is the tight coupling that exists between depth reso-lution and histogram resolution. To weaken this coupling, we propose compressive single-photon histograms (CSPH).CSPHs are a per-pixel compressive representation of the high-resolution histogram, that is built on-the-fly, as each photon is detected. They are based on a family of linear coding schemes that can be expressed as a simple matrix operation. We design different CSPH coding schemes for 3D imaging and evaluate them under different signal and background levels, laser waveforms, and illumination se-tups. Our results show that a well-designed CSPH can con-sistently reduce data rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude with-out compromising depth precision.
