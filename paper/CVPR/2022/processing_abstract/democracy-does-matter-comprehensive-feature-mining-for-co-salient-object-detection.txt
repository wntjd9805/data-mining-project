Co-salient object detection, with the target of detecting co-existed salient objects among a group of images, is gain-ing popularity. Recent works use the attention mechanism or extra information to aggregate common co-salient fea-tures, leading to incomplete even incorrect responses for target objects. In this paper, we aim to mine comprehen-sive co-salient features with democracy and reduce back-ground interference without introducing any extra informa-tion. To achieve this, we design a democratic prototype generation module to generate democratic response maps, covering sufficient co-salient regions and thereby involv-ing more shared attributes of co-salient objects. Then a comprehensive prototype based on the response maps can be generated as a guide for final prediction. To suppress the noisy background information in the prototype, we pro-pose a self-contrastive learning module, where both posi-tive and negative pairs are formed without relying on ad-ditional classification information. Besides, we also de-sign a democratic feature enhancement module to further strengthen the co-salient features by readjusting attention values. Extensive experiments show that our model obtains better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods, especially on challenging real-world cases (e.g., for CoCA, we obtain a gain of 2.0% for MAE, 5.4% for maximum F-measure, 2.3% for maximum E-measure, and 3.7% for S-measure) under the same settings.
