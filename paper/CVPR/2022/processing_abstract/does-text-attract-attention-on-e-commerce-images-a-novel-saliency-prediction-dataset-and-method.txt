E-commerce images are playing a central role in attract-ing people’s attention when retailing and shopping online, and an accurate attention prediction is of significant impor-tance for both customers and retailers, where its research is yet to start. In this paper, we establish the first dataset of saliency e-commerce images (SalECI), which allows for learning to predict saliency on the e-commerce images. We then provide specialized and thorough analysis by high-lighting the distinct features of e-commerce images, e.g., non-locality and correlation to text regions. Correspond-ingly, taking advantages of the non-local and self-attention mechanisms, we propose a salient SWin-Transformer back-bone, followed by a multi-task learning with saliency and text detection heads, where an information flow mechanism is proposed to further benefit both tasks. Experimental re-sults have verified the state-of-the-art performances of our work in the e-commerce scenario.
