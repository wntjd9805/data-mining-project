Monocular 6D pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Existing works often adopt a two-stage pipeline by establishing correspondences and utiliz-ing a RANSAC algorithm to calculate 6 degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose. Recent works try to integrate differentiableRANSAC algorithms to achieve an end-to-end 6D pose es-timation. However, most of them hardly consider the geo-metric features in 3D space, and ignore the topology cues when performing differentiable RANSAC algorithms. To this end, we proposed a Depth-Guided Edge ConvolutionalNetwork (DGECN) for 6D pose estimation task. We have made efforts from the following three aspects: 1) We take advantages of estimated depth information to guide both the correspondences-extraction process and the cascaded dif-ferentiable RANSAC algorithm with geometric information. 2) We leverage the uncertainty of the estimated depth map to improve accuracy and robustness of the output 6D pose. 3)We propose a differentiable Perspective-n-Point(PnP) algo-rithm via edge convolution to explore the topology relations between 2D-3D correspondences. Experiments demon-strate that our proposed network outperforms current works on both effectiveness and efficiency.
