Modern Earth observation satellites capture multi-exposure bursts of push-frame images that can be super-resolved via computational means. In this work, we pro-pose a super-resolution method for such multi-exposure se-quences, a problem that has received very little attention in the literature. The proposed method can handle the signal-dependent noise in the inputs, process sequences of any length, and be robust to inaccuracies in the exposure times. Furthermore, it can be trained end-to-end with self-supervision, without requiring ground truth high resolution frames, which makes it especially suited to handle real data. i) aCentral to our method are three key contributions: base-detail decomposition for handling errors in the expo-sure times, ii) a noise-level-aware feature encoding for im-proved fusion of frames with varying signal-to-noise ratio and iii) a permutation invariant fusion strategy by tempo-ral pooling operators. We evaluate the proposed method on synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms by a significant margin existing single-exposure approaches that we adapted to the multi-exposure case.
