Many convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for single image deblurring employ a U-Net structure to estimate la-tent sharp images. Having long been proven to be effec-tive in image restoration tasks, a single lane of encoder-decoder architecture overlooks the characteristic of deblur-ring, where a blurry image is generated from complicated blur kernels caused by tangled motions. Toward an ef-fective network architecture for single image deblurring, we present complemental sub-solution learning with a one-encoder-two-decoder architecture. Observing that multi-ple decoders successfully learn to decompose encoded fea-ture information into directional components, we further improve both the network efficiency and the deblurring per-formance by rotating and sharing kernels exploited in the decoders, which prevents the decoders from separating un-necessary components such as color shift. As a result, our proposed network shows superior results compared to U-Net while preserving the network parameters, and using the proposed network as the base network can improve the per-formance of existing state-of-the-art deblurring networks.
