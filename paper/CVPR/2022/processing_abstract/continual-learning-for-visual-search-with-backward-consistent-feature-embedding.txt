Disjoint Setup Blurry Setup In visual search, the gallery set could be incrementally growing and added to the database in practice. However, existing methods rely on the model trained on the entire dataset, ignoring the continual updating of the model. Be-sides, as the model updates, the new model must re-extract features for the entire gallery set to maintain compatible feature space, imposing a high computational cost for a large gallery set. To address the issues of long-term visual search, we introduce a continual learning (CL) approach that can handle the incrementally growing gallery set with backward embedding consistency. We enforce the losses of inter-session data coherence, neighbor-session model co-herence, and intra-session discrimination to conduct a con-tinual learner. In addition to the disjoint setup, our CL so-lution also tackles the situation of increasingly adding new classes for the blurry boundary without assuming all cat-egories known in the beginning and during model update.To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst CL method both tackling the issue of backward-consistent feature embedding and al-lowing novel classes to occur in the new sessions. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show the efﬁcacy of our approach under a wide range of setups1.
