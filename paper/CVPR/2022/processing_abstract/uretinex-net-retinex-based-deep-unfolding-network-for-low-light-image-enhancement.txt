Retinex model-based methods have shown to be effec-tive in layer-wise manipulation with well-designed priors for low-light image enhancement. However, the commonly used hand-crafted priors and optimization-driven solutions lead to the absence of adaptivity and efﬁciency. To ad-dress these issues, in this paper, we propose a Retinex-based deep unfolding network (URetinex-Net), which un-folds an optimization problem into a learnable network to decompose a low-light image into reﬂectance and illumi-nation layers. By formulating the decomposition problem as an implicit priors regularized model, three learning-based modules are carefully designed, responsible for data-dependent initialization, high-efﬁcient unfolding optimiza-tion, and user-speciﬁed illumination enhancement, respec-tively. Particularly, the proposed unfolding optimization module, introducing two networks to adaptively ﬁt implicit priors in data-driven manner, can realize noise suppres-sion and details preservation for the ﬁnal decomposition results. Extensive experiments on real-world low-light im-ages qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate the ef-fectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.
