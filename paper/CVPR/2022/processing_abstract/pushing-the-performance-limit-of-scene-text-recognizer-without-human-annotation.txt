Scene text recognition (STR) attracts much attention over the years because of its wide application. Most method-s train STR model in a fully supervised manner which re-quires large amounts of labeled data. Although synthetic data contributes a lot to STR, it suffers from the real-to-synthetic domain gap the restricts model performance. In this work, we aim to boost STR models by leveraging both synthetic data and the numerous real unlabeled images, ex-empting human annotation cost thoroughly. A robust con-sistency regularization based semi-supervised framework is proposed for STR, which can effectively solve the instabili-ty issue due to domain inconsistency between synthetic and real images. A character-level consistency regularization is designed to mitigate the misalignment between character-s in sequence recognition. Extensive experiments on stan-dard text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effective-ness of the proposed method. It can steadily improve exist-ing STR models, and boost an STR model to achieve new state-of-the-art results. To our best knowledge, this is theÔ¨Årst consistency regularization based framework that ap-plies successfully to STR.
