Standard semi-supervised learning (SSL) using class-balanced datasets has shown great progress to leverage un-labeled data effectively. However, the more realistic set-ting of class-imbalanced data – called imbalanced SSL – is largely underexplored and standard SSL tends to under-perform.In this paper, we propose a novel co-learning framework (CoSSL), which decouples representation and classifier learning while coupling them closely. To handle the data imbalance, we devise Tail-class Feature Enhance-ment (TFE) for classifier learning. Furthermore, the cur-rent evaluation protocol for imbalanced SSL focuses only on balanced test sets, which has limited practicality in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we further conduct a com-prehensive evaluation under various shifted test distribu-tions. In experiments, we show that our approach outper-forms other methods over a large range of shifted distribu-tions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets ranging from CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, toFood-101. Our code will be made publicly available.
