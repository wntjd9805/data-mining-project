Scene graph generation (SGG) is to detect object pairs with their relations in an image. Existing SGG approaches often use multi-stage pipelines to decompose this task into object detection, relation graph construction, and dense or dense-to-sparse relation prediction.Instead, from a perspective on SGG as a direct set prediction, this paper presents a simple, sparse, and unified framework, termed asStructured Sparse R-CNN. The key to our method is a set of learnable triplet queries and a structured triplet detec-tor which could be jointly optimized from the training set in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the triplet queries encode the general prior for object pairs with their rela-tions, and provide an initial guess of scene graphs for sub-sequent refinement. The triplet detector presents a cas-caded architecture to progressively refine the detected scene graphs with the customized dynamic heads. In addition, to relieve the training difficulty of our method, we propose a relaxed and enhanced training strategy based on knowl-edge distillation from a Siamese Sparse R-CNN. We per-form experiments on several datasets: Visual Genome andOpen Images V4/V6, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.In ad-dition, we also perform in-depth ablation studies to pro-vide insights on our structured modeling in triplet detec-tor design and training strategies.
