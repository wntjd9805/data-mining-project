Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has recently gained much attention for its promise to train seg-mentation models only with image-level labels. ExistingWSSS methods commonly argue that the sparse coverage of CAM incurs the performance bottleneck of WSSS. This paper provides analytical and empirical evidence that the actual bottleneck may not be sparse coverage but a global thresholding scheme applied after CAM. Then, we show that this issue can be mitigated by satisfying two conditions; 1) reducing the imbalance in the foreground activation and 2) increasing the gap between the foreground and the back-ground activation. Based on these findings, we propose a novel activation manipulation network with a per-pixel classification loss and a label conditioning module. Per-pixel classification naturally induces two-level activation in activation maps, which can penalize the most discrimina-tive parts, promote the less discriminative parts, and de-activate the background regions. Label conditioning im-poses that the output label of pseudo-masks should be any of true image-level labels; it penalizes the wrong activation assigned to non-target classes. Based on extensive analy-sis and evaluations, we demonstrate that each component helps produce accurate pseudo-masks, achieving the ro-bustness against the choice of the global threshold. Finally, our model achieves state-of-the-art records on both PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/gaviotas/AMN.
