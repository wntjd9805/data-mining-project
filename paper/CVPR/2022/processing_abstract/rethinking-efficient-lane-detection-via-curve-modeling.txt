This paper presents a novel parametric curve-based method for lane detection in RGB images. Unlike state-of-the-art segmentation-based and point detection-based methods that typically require heuristics to either decode predictions or formulate a large sum of anchors, the curve-based methods can learn holistic lane representations natu-rally. To handle the optimization difficulties of existing poly-nomial curve methods, we propose to exploit the parametricBÂ´ezier curve due to its ease of computation, stability, and high freedom degrees of transformations. In addition, we propose the deformable convolution-based feature flip fu-sion, for exploiting the symmetry properties of lanes in driv-ing scenes. The proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the popular LLAMAS benchmark.It also achieves favorable accuracy on the TuSimple andCULane datasets, while retaining both low latency (>150FPS) and small model size (<10M). Our method can serve as a new baseline, to shed the light on the parametric curves modeling for lane detection.
