We propose a keypoint-based object-level SLAM frame-work that can provide globally consistent 6DoF pose es-timates for symmetric and asymmetric objects alike. To the best of our knowledge, our system is among the ﬁrst to utilize the camera pose information from SLAM to pro-vide prior knowledge for tracking keypoints on symmetric objects – ensuring that new measurements are consistent with the current 3D scene. Moreover, our semantic key-point network is trained to predict the Gaussian covariance for the keypoints that captures the true error of the predic-tion, and thus is not only useful as a weight for the resid-uals in the system’s optimization problems, but also as a means to detect harmful statistical outliers without choos-ing a manual threshold. Experiments show that our method provides competitive performance to the state of the art in 6DoF object pose estimation, and at a real-time speed. Our code, pre-trained models, and keypoint labels are available https://github.com/rpng/suo_slam.
