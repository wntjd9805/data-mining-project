We study the effect of adversarial perturbations of im-ages on deep stereo matching networks for the disparity es-timation task. We present a method to craft a single set of perturbations that, when added to any stereo image pair in a dataset, can fool a stereo network to significantly al-ter the perceived scene geometry. Our perturbation im-ages are “universal” in that they not only corrupt estimates of the network on the dataset they are optimized for, but also generalize to different architectures trained on differ-ent datasets. We evaluate our approach on multiple bench-mark datasets where our perturbations can increase the D1-error (akin to fooling rate) of state-of-the-art stereo net-works from 1% to as much as 87%. We investigate the effect of perturbations on the estimated scene geometry and iden-tify object classes that are most vulnerable. Our analysis on the activations of registered points between left and right images led us to find architectural components that can in-crease robustness against adversaries. By simply designing networks with such components, one can reduce the effect of adversaries by up to 60.5%, which rivals the robustness of networks fine-tuned with costly adversarial data augmen-tation. Our design principle also improves their robustness against common image corruptions by an average of 70%.
