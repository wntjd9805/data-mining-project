as a prototype y via solvingFinding prototypes (e.g., mean and median) for a dataset is central to a number of common machine learn-ing algorithms. Subspaces have been shown to provide use-ful, robust representations for datasets of images, videos and more. Since subspaces correspond to points on aGrassmann manifold, one is led to consider the idea of a subspace prototype for a Grassmann-valued dataset.While a number of different subspace prototypes have been described, the calculation of some of these prototypes has proven to be computationally expensive while other proto-types are affected by outliers and produce highly imperfect clustering on noisy data. This work proposes a new sub-space prototype, the flag median, and introduces the Fla-gIRLS algorithm for its calculation. We provide evidence that the flag median is robust to outliers and can be used effectively in algorithms like Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) to produce improved clusterings on Grassmannians. Numer-ical experiments include a synthetic dataset, the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, the Mind’s Eye video dataset and the UCF YouTube action dataset. The flag median is compared the other leading algorithms for computing pro-totypes on the Grassmannian, namely, the ℓ2-median and to the flag mean. We find that using FlagIRLS to compute the flag median converges in 4 iterations on a synthetic dataset. We also see that Grassmannian LBG with a code-book size of 20 and using the flag median produces at least a 10% improvement in cluster purity over GrassmannianLBG using the flag mean or ℓ2-median on the Mind’s Eye dataset.
