OriginalUnified CIR t ditiInput conditionsRepaintedConditional image repainting (CIR) is an advanced im-age editing task, which requires the model to generate vi-sual content in user-speciﬁed regions conditioned on mul-tiple cross-modality constraints, and composite the visual content with the provided background seamlessly. Existing methods based on two-phase architecture design assume dependency between phases and cause color-image incon-gruity. To solve these problems, we propose a novel UniﬁedConditional image Repainting Network (UniCoRN). We break the two-phase assumption in the CIR task by con-structing the interaction and dependency relationship be-tween background and other conditions. We further intro-duce the hierarchical structure into cross-modality similar-ity model to capture feature patterns at different levels and bridge the gap between visual content and color condition.A new LANDSCAPE-CIR dataset is collected and annotated to expand the application scenarios of the CIR task. Exper-iments show that UniCoRN achieves higher synthetic qual-ity, better condition consistency, and more realistic com-positing effect.
