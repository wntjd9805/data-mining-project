The 360◦ imaging has recently gained much attention; however, its angular resolution is relatively lower than that of a narrow field-of-view (FOV) perspective image as it is captured using a fisheye lens with the same sensor size.Therefore, it is beneficial to super-resolve a 360◦ image.Several attempts have been made, but mostly considered equirectangular projection (ERP) as one of the ways for 360◦ image representation despite the latitude-dependent distortions.In that case, as the output high-resolution (HR) image is always in the same ERP format as the low-resolution (LR) input, additional information loss may oc-cur when transforming the HR image to other projection types. In this paper, we propose SphereSR, a novel frame-work to generate a continuous spherical image represen-tation from an LR 360◦ image, with the goal of predicting the RGB values at given spherical coordinates for super-resolution with an arbitrary 360◦ image projection. Specif-ically, first we propose a feature extraction module that rep-resents the spherical data based on an icosahedron and that efficiently extracts features on the spherical surface.We then propose a spherical local implicit image func-tion (SLIIF) to predict RGB values at the spherical coordi-nates. As such, SphereSR flexibly reconstructs an HR image given an arbitrary projection type. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed method signifi-cantly surpasses existing methods in terms of performance.
