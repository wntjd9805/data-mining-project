Occluded person re-identification (ReID) aims at match-ing occluded person images to holistic ones across dif-ferent camera views. Target Pedestrians (TP) are often disturbed by Non-Pedestrian Occlusions (NPO) and Non-Target Pedestrians (NTP). Previous methods mainly focus on increasing the model’s robustness against NPO while ig-noring feature contamination from NTP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Erasing and Diffusion Network (FED) to simultaneously handle challenges from NPO andNTP. Specifically, aided by the NPO augmentation strategy that simulates NPO on holistic pedestrian images and gen-erates precise occlusion masks, NPO features are explic-itly eliminated by our proposed Occlusion Erasing Mod-ule (OEM). Subsequently, we diffuse the pedestrian repre-sentations with other memorized features to synthesize theNTP characteristics in the feature space through the novelFeature Diffusion Module (FDM). With the guidance of the occlusion scores from OEM, the feature diffusion process is conducted on visible body parts, thereby improving the quality of the synthesized NTP characteristics. We can greatly improve the model’s perception ability towards TP and alleviate the influence of NPO and NTP by jointly op-timizing OEM and FDM. Furthermore, the proposed FDM works as an auxiliary module for training and will not be engaged in the inference phase, thus with high flexibility.Experiments on occluded and holistic person ReID bench-marks demonstrate the superiority of FED over state-of-the-art methods.
