while obtaining similar results on in-distribution images.Face identification (FI) is ubiquitous and drives many high-stake decisions made by the law enforcement. A com-mon FI approach compares two images by taking the co-sine similarity between their image embeddings. Yet, such approach suffers from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) gen-eralization to new types of images (e.g., when a query face is masked, cropped or rotated) not included in the training set or the gallery. Here, we propose a re-ranking approach that compares two faces using the Earth Mover’s Distance on the deep, spatial features of image patches. Our ex-tra comparison stage explicitly examines image similarity at a fine-grained level (e.g., eyes to eyes) and is more ro-bust to OOD perturbations and occlusions than traditionalFI. Interestingly, without finetuning feature extractors, our method consistently improves the accuracy on all testedOOD queries: masked, cropped, rotated, and adversarial
