Deep image inpainting can inpaint a corrupted image using a feed-forward inference, but still fails to handle large missing area or complex semantics. Recently, GAN inver-sion based inpainting methods propose to leverage seman-tic information in pretrained generator (e.g., StyleGAN) to solve the above issues. Different from feed-forward meth-ods, they seek for a closest latent code to the corrupted image and feed it to a pretrained generator. However, in-ferring the latent code is either time-consuming or inaccu-rate. In this paper, we develop a dual-path inpainting net-work with inversion path and feed-forward path, in which inversion path provides auxiliary information to help feed-forward path. We also design a novel deformable fusion module to align the feature maps in two paths. Experiments on FFHQ and LSUN demonstrate that our method is effec-tive in solving the aforementioned problems while produc-ing more realistic results than state-of-the-art methods.
