Existing knowledge distillation works for semantic seg-mentation mainly focus on transfering high-level contextual knowledge from teacher to student. However, low-level tex-ture knowledge is also of vital importance for characteriz-ing the local structural pattern and global statistical prop-erty, such as boundary, smoothness, regularity and color contrast, which may not be well addressed by high-level deep features.In this paper, we are intended to take full advantage of both structural and statistical texture knowl-edge and propose a novel Structural and Statistical TextureKnowledge Distillation (SSTKD) framework for SemanticSegmentation. Specifically, for structural texture knowl-edge, we introduce a Contourlet Decomposition Module (CDM) that decomposes low-level features with iterative laplacian pyramid and directional filter bank to mine the structural texture knowledge. For statistical knowledge, we propose a Denoised Texture Intensity Equalization Mod-ule (DTIEM) to adaptively extract and enhance statistical texture knowledge through heuristics iterative quantization and denoised operation. Finally, each knowledge learning is supervised by an individual loss function, forcing the stu-dent network to mimic the teacher better from a broader perspective. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, Pas-cal VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets.Figure 1. The overview of the structural and statistical texture knowledge distillation of an example image. Two kinds of the tex-ture knowledge are extracted from the low-level feature of a CNN backbone. The original structural and statistical texture are fuzzy and in low-contrast. After distillation, the contour is clearer and the intensity contrast is more equalized, showing that two kinds of the texture are both enhanced.
