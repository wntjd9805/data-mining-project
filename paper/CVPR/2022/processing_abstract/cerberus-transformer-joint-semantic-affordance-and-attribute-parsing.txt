Multi-task indoor scene understanding is widely consid-ered as an intriguing formulation, as the affinity of differ-In this pa-ent tasks may lead to improved performance. per, we tackle the new problem of joint semantic, affordance and attribute parsing. However, successfully resolving it requires a model to capture long-range dependency, learn from weakly aligned data and properly balance sub-tasks during training. To this end, we propose an attention-based architecture named Cerberus and a tailored training frame-work. Our method effectively addresses aforementioned challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks. Moreover, an in-depth analysis shows concept affinity consistent with human cognition, which inspires us to explore the possibility of weakly supervised learn-ing. Surprisingly, Cerberus achieves strong results using only 0.1% âˆ’ 1% annotation. Visualizations further con-firm that this success is credited to common attention maps across tasks.
