Blind face restoration, which aims to reconstruct high-quality images from low-quality inputs, can benefit many applications. Although existing generative-based methods achieve significant progress in producing high-quality im-ages, they often fail to restore natural face shapes and high-fidelity facial details from severely-degraded inputs. In this work, we propose to integrate shape and generative pri-ors to guide the challenging blind face restoration. Firstly, we set up a shape restoration module to recover reason-able facial geometry with 3D reconstruction. Secondly, a pretrained facial generator is adopted as decoder to gener-ate photo-realistic high-resolution images. To ensure high-fidelity, hierarchical spatial features extracted from the low-quality inputs and rendered 3D images are inserted into the decoder with our proposed Adaptive Feature FusionBlock (AFFB). Moreover, we introduce hybrid-level losses* Chengjie Wang and Ying Tai are corresponding authors. to jointly train the shape and generative priors together with other network parts such that these two priors better adapt to our blind face restoration task. The proposed Shape and Generative Prior integrated Network (SGPN) can re-store high-quality images with clear face shapes and real-istic facial details. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate SGPN performs favorably against state-of-the-art blind face restoration methods.
