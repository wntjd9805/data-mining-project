Rotated object detection is a challenging issue in com-puter vision ﬁeld.Inadequate rotated representation and the confusion of parametric regression have been the bottle-neck for high performance rotated detection. In this paper, we propose an orientation-sensitive keypoint based rotated detector OSKDet. First, we adopt a set of keypoints to rep-resent the target and predict the keypoint heatmap on ROI to get the rotated box. By proposing the orientation-sensitive heatmap, OSKDet could learn the shape and direction of rotated target implicitly and has stronger modeling capa-bilities for rotated representation, which improves the lo-calization accuracy and acquires high quality detection re-sults. Second, we explore a new unordered keypoint rep-resentation paradigm, which could avoid the confusion of keypoint regression caused by rule based ordering. Further-more, we propose a localization quality uncertainty mod-ule to better predict the classiﬁcation score by the distri-bution uncertainty of keypoints heatmap. Experimental re-sults on several public benchmarks show the state-of-the-art performance of OSKDet. Speciﬁcally, we achieve an AP of 80.91% on DOTA, 89.98% on HRSC2016, 97.27% onUCAS-AOD, and a F-measure of 92.18% on ICDAR2015, 81.43% on ICDAR2017, respectively.
