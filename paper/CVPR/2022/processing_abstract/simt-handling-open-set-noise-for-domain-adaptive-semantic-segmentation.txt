This paper studies a practical domain adaptive (DA) se-mantic segmentation problem where only pseudo-labeled target data is accessible through a black-box model. Due to the domain gap and label shift between two domains, pseudo-labeled target data contains mixed closed-set and open-set label noises. In this paper, we propose a simplex noise transition matrix (SimT) to model the mixed noise distributions in DA semantic segmentation and formulate the problem as estimation of SimT. By exploiting computa-tional geometry analysis and properties of segmentation, we design three complementary regularizers, i.e. volume regu-larization, anchor guidance, convex guarantee, to approxi-mate the true SimT. Specifically, volume regularization min-imizes the volume of simplex formed by rows of the non-square SimT, which ensures outputs of segmentation model to fit into the ground truth label distribution. To compen-sate for the lack of open-set knowledge, anchor guidance and convex guarantee are devised to facilitate the modeling of open-set noise distribution and enhance the discrimina-tive feature learning among closed-set and open-set classes.The estimated SimT is further utilized to correct noise is-sues in pseudo labels and promote the generalization abil-ity of segmentation model on target domain data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimT can be flexibly plugged into existing DA methods to boost the performance.
