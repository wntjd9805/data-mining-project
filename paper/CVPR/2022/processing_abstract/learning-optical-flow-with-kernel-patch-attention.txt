Optical ﬂow is a fundamental method used for quanti-tative motion estimation on the image plane. In the deep learning era, most works treat it as a task of ‘matching of features’, learning to pull matched pixels as close as possi-ble in feature space and vice versa. However, spatial afﬁnity (smoothness constraint), another important component for motion understanding, has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, called kernel patch attention (KPA), to better resolve the ambiguity in dense matching by explicitly taking the local context relations into consideration. Our KPA operates on each local patch, and learns to mine the context afﬁnities for better inferring theﬂow ﬁelds. It can be plugged into contemporary optical ﬂow architecture and empower the model to conduct comprehen-sive motion analysis with both feature similarities and spa-tial relations. On Sintel dataset, the proposed KPA-Flow achieves the best performance with EPE of 1.35 on clean pass and 2.36 on ﬁnal pass, and it sets a new record of 4.60% in F1-all on KITTI-15 benchmark.
