Arbitrary style transfer (AST) and domain generaliza-tion (DG) are important yet challenging visual learning tasks, which can be cast as a feature distribution match-ing problem. With the assumption of Gaussian feature dis-tribution, conventional feature distribution matching meth-ods usually match the mean and standard deviation of fea-tures. However, the feature distributions of real-world data are usually much more complicated than Gaussian, which cannot be accurately matched by using only the first-order and second-order statistics, while it is computationally pro-hibitive to use high-order statistics for distribution match-ing. In this work, we, for the first time to our best knowl-edge, propose to perform Exact Feature Distribution Match-ing (EFDM) by exactly matching the empirical CumulativeDistribution Functions (eCDFs) of image features, which could be implemented by applying the Exact HistogramMatching (EHM) in the image feature space. Particularly, a fast EHM algorithm, named Sort-Matching, is employed to perform EFDM in a plug-and-play manner with mini-mal cost. The effectiveness of our proposed EFDM method is verified on a variety of AST and DG tasks, demonstrat-ing new state-of-the-art results. Codes are available at https://github.com/YBZh/EFDM .
