Active learning is a promising alternative to alleviate the issue of high annotation cost in the computer vision tasks by consciously selecting more informative samples to la-bel. Active learning for object detection is more challeng-ing and existing efforts on it are relatively rare. In this pa-per, we propose a novel hybrid approach to address this problem, where the instance-level uncertainty and diver-sity are jointly considered in a bottom-up manner. To bal-ance the computational complexity, the proposed approach is designed as a two-stage procedure. At the ﬁrst stage, anEntropy-based Non-Maximum Suppression (ENMS) is pre-sented to estimate the uncertainty of every image, which performs NMS according to the entropy in the feature space to remove predictions with redundant information gains. At the second stage, a diverse prototype (DivProto) strategy is explored to ensure the diversity across images by progres-sively converting it into the intra-class and inter-class di-versities of the entropy-based class-speciﬁc prototypes. Ex-tensive experiments are conducted on MS COCO and Pas-cal VOC, and the proposed approach achieves state of the art results and signiﬁcantly outperforms the other counter-parts, highlighting its superiority.
