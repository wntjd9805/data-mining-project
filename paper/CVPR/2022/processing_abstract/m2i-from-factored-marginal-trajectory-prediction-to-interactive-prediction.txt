Predicting future motions of road participants is an im-portant task for driving autonomously in urban scenes. Ex-isting models excel at predicting marginal trajectories for single agents, yet it remains an open question to jointly predict scene compliant trajectories over multiple agents.The challenge is due to exponentially increasing predic-tion space as a function of the number of agents. In this work, we exploit the underlying relations between interact-ing agents and decouple the joint prediction problem into marginal prediction problems. Our proposed approach M2I first classifies interacting agents as pairs of influencers and reactors, and then leverages a marginal prediction model and a conditional prediction model to predict trajectories for the influencers and reactors, respectively. The predic-tions from interacting agents are combined and selected ac-cording to their joint likelihoods. Experiments show that our simple but effective approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset interac-tive prediction benchmark.
