Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) aims to facil-itate the training and deployment of object detectors with the help of a large amount of unlabeled data. Though various self-training based and consistency-regularization based SSOD methods have been proposed, most of them are anchor-based detectors, ignoring the fact that in many real-world applications anchor-free detectors are more de-manded.In this paper, we intend to bridge this gap and propose a DenSe Learning (DSL) based anchor-freeSSOD algorithm.Specifically, we achieve this goal by introducing several novel techniques, including an Adap-tive Filtering strategy for assigning multi-level and accu-rate dense pixel-wise pseudo-labels, an Aggregated Teacher for producing stable and precise pseudo-labels, and an uncertainty-consistency-regularization term among scales and shuffled patches for improving the generalization ca-pability of the detector. Extensive experiments are con-ducted on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC, and the re-sults show that our proposed DSL method records new state-of-the-art SSOD performance, surpassing existing methods by a large margin.
