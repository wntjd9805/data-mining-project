Recently, table structure recognition has achieved im-pressive progress with the help of deep graph models. Most of them exploit single visual cues of tabular elements or sim-ply combine visual cues with other modalities via early fu-sion to reason their graph relationships. However, neither early fusion nor individually reasoning in terms of multi-ple modalities can be appropriate for all varieties of tableInstead, different modali-structures with great diversity. ties are expected to collaborate with each other in different patterns for different table cases. In the community, the im-portance of intra-inter modality interactions for table struc-ture reasoning is still unexplored. In this paper, we define it as heterogeneous table structure recognition (Hetero-TSR) problem. With the aim of filling this gap, we present a novelNeural Collaborative Graph Machines (NCGM) equipped with stacked collaborative blocks, which alternatively ex-tracts intra-modality context and models inter-modality in-teractions in a hierarchical way. It can represent the intra-inter modality relationships of tabular elements more ro-bustly, which significantly improves the recognition perfor-mance. We also show that the proposed NCGM can mod-ulate collaborative pattern of different modalities condi-tioned on the context of intra-modality cues, which is vital for diversified table cases. Experimental results on bench-marks demonstrate our proposed NCGM achieves state-of-the-art performance and beats other contemporary methods by a large margin especially under challenging scenarios.
