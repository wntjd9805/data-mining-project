Atlas building and image registration are important tasks for medical image analysis. Once one or multiple atlases from an image population have been constructed, com-monly (1) images are warped into an atlas space to study intra-subject or inter-subject variations or (2) a possibly probabilistic atlas is warped into image space to assign anatomical labels. Atlas estimation and nonparametric transformations are computationally expensive as they usu-ally require numerical optimization. Additionally, previ-ous approaches for atlas building often deﬁne similarity measures between a fuzzy atlas and each individual image, which may cause alignment difﬁculties because a fuzzy at-las does not exhibit clear anatomical structures in contrast to the individual images. This work explores using a con-volutional neural network (CNN) to jointly predict the atlas and a stationary velocity ﬁeld (SVF) parameterization for diffeomorphic image registration with respect to the atlas.Our approach does not require afﬁne pre-registrations and utilizes pairwise image alignment losses to increase regis-tration accuracy. We evaluate our model on 3D knee mag-netic resonance images (MRI) from the OAI-ZIB dataset.Our results show that the proposed framework achieves bet-ter performance than other state-of-the-art image registra-tion algorithms, allows for end-to-end training, and for fast inference at test time.1
