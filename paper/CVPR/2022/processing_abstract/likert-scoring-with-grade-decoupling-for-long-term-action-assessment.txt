Long-term action quality assessment is a task of eval-uating how well an action is performed, namely, estimat-ing a quality score from a long video.Intuitively, long-term actions generally involve parts exhibiting different lev-els of skill, and we call the levels of skill as performance grades. For example, technical highlights and faults may appear in the same long-term action. Hence, the final score should be determined by the comprehensive effect of dif-ferent grades exhibited in the video. To explore this latent relationship, we design a novel Likert scoring paradigm in-spired by the Likert scale in psychometrics, in which we quantify the grades explicitly and generate the final qual-ity score by combining the quantitative values and the cor-responding responses estimated from the video, instead of performing direct regression. Moreover, we extract grade-specific features, which will be used to estimate the re-sponses of each grade, through a Transformer decoder ar-chitecture with diverse learnable queries. The whole model is named as Grade-decoupling Likert Transformer (GDLT), and we achieve state-of-the-art results on two long-term ac-tion assessment datasets.1Figure 1. A brief illustration of our idea. The features of an action video are first disentangled into different grade-aware features, which contain the information related to specific grades. Then they will be regarded as “evidence” to generate responses and “fill” the“scale”. The final quality score is generated by aggregating the scores of “scale questions” (i.e., different grades) according to the responses from the video.
