Few-shot classiﬁcation is a challenging problem as only very few training examples are given for each new task. One of the effective research lines to address this challenge fo-cuses on learning deep representations driven by a similar-ity measure between a query image and few support images of some class. Statistically, this amounts to measure the dependency of image features, viewed as random vectors in a high-dimensional embedding space. Previous meth-ods either only use marginal distributions without consid-ering joint distributions, suffering from limited represen-tation capability, or are computationally expensive thoughIn this paper, we propose harnessing joint distributions. a deep Brownian Distance Covariance (DeepBDC) method for few-shot classiﬁcation. The central idea of DeepBDC is to learn image representations by measuring the discrep-ancy between joint characteristic functions of embedded features and product of the marginals. As the BDC metric is decoupled, we formulate it as a highly modular and efﬁcient layer. Furthermore, we instantiate DeepBDC in two dif-ferent few-shot classiﬁcation frameworks. We make experi-ments on six standard few-shot image benchmarks, covering general object recognition, ﬁne-grained categorization and cross-domain classiﬁcation. Extensive evaluations show our DeepBDC signiﬁcantly outperforms the counterparts, while establishing new state-of-the-art results. The source code is available at http://www.peihuali.org/DeepBDC.
