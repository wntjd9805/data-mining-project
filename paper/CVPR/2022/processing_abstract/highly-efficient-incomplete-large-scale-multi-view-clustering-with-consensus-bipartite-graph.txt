Multi-view clustering has received increasing attention due to its effectiveness in fusing complementary informa-tion without manual annotations. Most previous methods hold the assumption that each instance appears in all views.However, it is not uncommon to see that some views may contain some missing instances, which gives rise to in-complete multi-view clustering (IMVC) in literature. Al-though many IMVC methods have been recently proposed, they always encounter high complexity and expensive timeIn expenditure from being applied into large-scale tasks. this paper, we present a flexible highly-efficient incomplete large-scale multi-view clustering approach based on bipar-tite graph framework to solve these issues. Specifically, we formalize multi-view anchor learning and incomplete bipar-tite graph into a unified framework, which coordinates with each other to boost cluster performance. By introducing the flexible bipartite graph framework to handle IMVC for the first practice, our proposed method enjoys linear complexity respecting to instance numbers, which is more applicable for large-scale IMVC tasks. Comprehensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the ef-fectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm against other IMVC competitors. The code is available at 1.
