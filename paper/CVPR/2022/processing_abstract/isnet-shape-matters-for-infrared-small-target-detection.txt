Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) refers to extract-ing small and dim targets from blurred backgrounds, which has a wide range of applications such as traffic manage-ment and marine rescue. Due to the low signal-to-noise ra-tio and low contrast, infrared targets are easily submerged in the background of heavy noise and clutter. How to de-tect the precise shape information of infrared targets re-mains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel in-frared shape network (ISNet), where Taylor finite differ-ence (TFD)-inspired edge block and two-orientation atten-tion aggregation (TOAA) block are devised to address this problem. Specifically, TFD-inspired edge block aggregates and enhances the comprehensive edge information from dif-ferent levels, in order to improve the contrast between tar-get and background and also lay a foundation for extracting shape information with mathematical interpretation. TOAA block calculates the low-level information with attention mechanism in both row and column directions and fuses it with the high-level information to capture the shape char-acteristic of targets and suppress noises. In addition, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 1,000 realistic im-ages in various target shapes, different target sizes, and rich clutter backgrounds with accurate pixel-level annota-tions, called IRSTD-1k. Experiments on public datasets andIRSTD-1k demonstrate the superiority of our approach over representative state-of-the-art IRSTD methods.
