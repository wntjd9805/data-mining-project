Human pose estimation (HPE) usually requires large-scale training data to reach high performance. However, it is rather time-consuming to collect high-quality and fine-grained annotations for human body. To alleviate this is-sue, we revisit HPE and propose a location-free framework without supervision of keypoint locations. We reformulate the regression-based HPE from the perspective of classifi-cation. Inspired by the CAM-based weakly-supervised ob-ject localization, we observe that the coarse keypoint lo-cations can be acquired through the part-aware CAMs but unsatisfactory due to the gap between the fine-grained HPE and the object-level localization. To this end, we propose a customized transformer framework to mine the fine-grained representation of human context, equipped with the struc-tural relation to capture subtle differences among keypoints.Concretely, we design a Multi-scale Spatial-guided ContextEncoder to fully capture the global human context while fo-cusing on the part-aware regions and a Relation-encodedPose Prototype Generation module to encode the structural relations. All these works together for strengthening the weak supervision from image-level category labels on lo-cations. Our model achieves competitive performance on three datasets when only supervised at a category-level and importantly, it can achieve comparable results with fully-supervised methods with only 25% location labels on MS-COCO and MPII.
