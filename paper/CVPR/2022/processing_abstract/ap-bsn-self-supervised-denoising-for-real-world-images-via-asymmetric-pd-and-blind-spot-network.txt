Blind-spot network (BSN) and its variants have made signiﬁcant advances in self-supervised denoising. Never-theless, they are still bound to synthetic noisy inputs due to less practical assumptions like pixel-wise independent noise. Hence, it is challenging to deal with spatially corre-lated real-world noise using self-supervised BSN. Recently, pixel-shufﬂe downsampling (PD) has been proposed to re-move the spatial correlation of real-world noise. However, it is not trivial to integrate PD and BSN directly, which prevents the fully self-supervised denoising model on real-world images. We propose an Asymmetric PD (AP) to ad-dress this issue, which introduces different PD stride factors for training and inference. We systematically demonstrate that the proposed AP can resolve inherent trade-offs caused by speciﬁc PD stride factors and make BSN applicable to practical scenarios. To this end, we develop AP-BSN, a state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising method for real-world sRGB images. We further propose random-replacing reﬁnement, which signiﬁcantly improves the performance of our AP-BSN without any additional parameters. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method outperforms the other self-supervised and even unpaired denoising methods by a large margin, without using any additional knowledge, e.g., noise level, regarding the underlying unknown noise.
