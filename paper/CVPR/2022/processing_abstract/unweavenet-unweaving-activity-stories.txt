Our lives can be seen as a complex weaving of activi-ties; we switch from one activity to another, to maximise our achievements or in reaction to demands placed upon us. Observing a video of unscripted daily activities, we parse the video into its constituent activity threads through a process we call unweaving. To accomplish this, we in-troduce a video representation explicitly capturing activity threads called a thread bank, along with a neural controller capable of detecting goal changes and resuming of past activ-ities, together forming UnweaveNet. We train and evaluateUnweaveNet on sequences from the unscripted egocentric dataset EPIC-KITCHENS. We propose and showcase the efÔ¨Å-cacy of pretraining UnweaveNet in a self-supervised manner.
