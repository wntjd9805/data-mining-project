Understanding network generalization and feature dis-crimination is an open research problem in visual recogni-tion. Many studies have been conducted to assess the qual-ity of feature representations. One of the simple strategies is to utilize a linear probing classifier to quantitatively eval-uate the class accuracy under the obtained features. The typical linear probe is only applied as a proxy at the in-ference time, but its efficacy in measuring featuresâ€™ suit-ability for linear classification is largely neglected in train-ing. In this paper, we propose an episodic linear probing (ELP) classifier to reflect the generalization of visual rep-resentations in an online manner. ELP is trained with de-tached features from the network and re-initialized episod-ically.It demonstrates the discriminability of the visual representations in training. Then, an ELP-suitable Regu-larization term (ELP-SR) is introduced to reflect the dis-tances of probability distributions between the ELP classi-fier and the main classifier. ELP-SR leverages a re-scaling factor to regularize each sample in training, which modu-lates the loss function adaptively and encourages the fea-tures to be discriminative and generalized. We observe sig-nificant improvements in three real-world visual recognition tasks: fine-grained visual classification, long-tailed visual recognition, and generic object recognition. The perfor-mance gains show the effectiveness of our method in im-proving network generalization and feature discrimination.
