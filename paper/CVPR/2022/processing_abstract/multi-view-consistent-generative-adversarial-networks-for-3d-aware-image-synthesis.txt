3D-aware image synthesis aims to generate images of objects from multiple views by learning a 3D representa-tion. However, one key challenge remains: existing ap-proaches lack geometry constraints, hence usually fail to generate multi-view consistent images. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistent GenerativeAdversarial Networks (MVCGAN) for high-quality 3D-aware image synthesis with geometry constraints. By lever-aging the underlying 3D geometry information of generated images, i.e., depth and camera transformation matrix, we explicitly establish stereo correspondence between views to perform multi-view joint optimization. In particular, we en-force the photometric consistency between pairs of views and integrate a stereo mixup mechanism into the training process, encouraging the model to reason about the cor-rect 3D shape. Besides, we design a two-stage training strategy with feature-level multi-view joint optimization to improve the image quality. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that MVCGAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance for 3D-aware image synthesis.
