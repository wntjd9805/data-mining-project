Pansharpening aims to fuse a registered high-resolution panchromatic image (PAN) with a low-resolution hyper-spectral image (LR-HSI) to generate an enhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial resolution. Existing pansharp-ening approaches neglect using an attention mechanism to transfer HR texture features from PAN to LR-HSI fea-tures, resulting in spatial and spectral distortions. In this paper, we present a novel attention mechanism for pan-sharpening called HyperTransformer, in which features ofLR-HSI and PAN are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer, respectively. HyperTransformer consists of three main modules, namely two separate feature extrac-tors for PAN and HSI, a multi-head feature soft-attention module, and a spatial-spectral feature fusion module. Such a network improves both spatial and spectral quality mea-sures of the pansharpened HSI by learning cross-feature space dependencies and long-range details of PAN andLR-HSI. Furthermore, HyperTransformer can be utilized across multiple spatial scales at the backbone for obtain-ing improved performance. Extensive experiments con-ducted on three widely used datasets demonstrate that Hy-perTransformer achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on both spatial and spectral qual-ity measures.
