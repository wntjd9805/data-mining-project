Deep Learning (DL) has shown great promise in the un-supervised task of clustering. That said, while in classical (i.e., non-deep) clustering the benefits of the nonparamet-ric approach are well known, most deep-clustering meth-ods are parametric: namely, they require a predefined and fixed number of clusters, denoted by K. When K is un-known, however, using model-selection criteria to choose its optimal value might become computationally expensive, especially in DL as the training process would have to be repeated numerous times. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an effective deep-clustering method that does not require knowing the value of K as it infers it during the learning. Using a split/merge framework, a dynamic architecture that adapts to the changing K, and a novel loss, our proposed method outperforms existing nonpara-metric methods (both classical and deep ones). While the very few existing deep nonparametric methods lack scal-ability, we demonstrate ours by being the first to report the performance of such a method on ImageNet. We also demonstrate the importance of inferring K by showing how methods that fix it deteriorate in performance when their assumed K value gets further from the ground-truth one, especially on imbalanced datasets.
