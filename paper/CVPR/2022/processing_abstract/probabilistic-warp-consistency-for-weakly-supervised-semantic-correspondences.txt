We propose Probabilistic Warp Consistency, a weakly-supervised learning objective for semantic matching. Our approach directly supervises the dense matching scores pre-dicted by the network, encoded as a conditional probability distribution. We first construct an image triplet by apply-ing a known warp to one of the images in a pair depict-ing different instances of the same object class. Our prob-abilistic learning objectives are then derived using the con-straints arising from the resulting image triplet. We fur-ther account for occlusion and background clutter present in real image pairs by extending our probabilistic output space with a learnable unmatched state. To supervise it, we design an objective between image pairs depicting dif-ferent object classes. We validate our method by apply-ing it to four recent semantic matching architectures. Our weakly-supervised approach sets a new state-of-the-art on four challenging semantic matching benchmarks. Lastly, we demonstrate that our objective also brings substantial improvements in the strongly-supervised regime, when com-bined with keypoint annotations.
