We design a Kernelized Few-shot Object Detector by leveraging kernelized matrices computed over multiple pro-posal regions, which yield expressive non-linear represen-tations whose model complexity is learned on the ﬂy. Our pipeline contains several modules. An Encoding Network encodes support and query images. Our Kernelized Auto-correlation unit forms the linear, polynomial and RBF ker-nelized representations from features extracted within sup-port regions of support images. These features are then cross-correlated against features of a query image to obtain attention weights, and generate query proposal regions via an Attention Region Proposal Net. As the query proposal regions are many, each described by the linear, polyno-mial and RBF kernelized matrices, their formation is costly but that cost is reduced by our proposed Integral Region-of-Interest Aggregation unit. Finally, the Multi-head Rela-tion Net combines all kernelized (second-order) represen-tations with the ﬁrst-order feature maps to learn support-query class relations and locations. We outperform the state of the art on novel classes by 3.8%, 5.4% and 5.7% mAP onPASCAL VOC 2007, FSOD, and COCO.
