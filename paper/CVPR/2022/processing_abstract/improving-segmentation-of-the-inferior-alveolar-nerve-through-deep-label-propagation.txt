Many recent works in dentistry and maxillofacial im-agery focused on the Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) canal detection. Unfortunately, the small extent of available 3D maxillofacial datasets has strongly limited the performance of deep learning-based techniques. On the other hand, a huge amount of sparsely annotated data is produced every day from the regular procedures in the maxillofacial prac-tice. Despite the amount of sparsely labeled images being signiﬁcant, the adoption of those data still raises an open problem.Indeed, the deep learning approach frames the presence of dense annotations as a crucial factor. Recent efforts in literature have hence focused on developing label propagation techniques to expand sparse annotations into dense labels. However, the proposed methods proved only marginally effective for the purpose of segmenting the alve-olar nerve in CBCT scans. This paper exploits and pub-licly releases a new 3D densely annotated dataset, through which we are able to train a deep label propagation model which obtains better results than those available in litera-ture. By combining a segmentation model trained on the 3D annotated data and label propagation, we signiﬁcantly improve the state of the art in the Inferior Alveolar Nerve segmentation.
