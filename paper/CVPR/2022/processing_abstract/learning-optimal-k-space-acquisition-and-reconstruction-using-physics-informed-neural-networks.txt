The inherent slow imaging speed of Magnetic ResonanceImage (MRI) has spurred the development of various ac-celeration methods, typically through heuristically under-sampling the MRI measurement domain known as k-space.Recently, deep neural networks have been applied to re-construct undersampled k-space data and have shown im-proved reconstruction performance. While most of these methods focus on designing novel reconstruction networks or new training strategies for a given undersampling pat-tern, e.g., Cartesian undersampling or Non-Cartesian sam-pling, to date, there is limited research aiming to learn and optimize k-space sampling strategies using deep neural net-works. This work proposes a novel optimization framework to learn k-space sampling trajectories by considering it as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) problem that can be solved using neural ODE. In particular, the sampling of k-space data is framed as a dynamic system, in which neu-ral ODE is formulated to approximate the system with ad-ditional constraints on MRI physics. In addition, we have also demonstrated that trajectory optimization and image reconstruction can be learned collaboratively for improved imaging efficiency and reconstruction performance. Exper-iments were conducted on different in-vivo datasets (e.g., brain and knee images) acquired with different sequences.Initial results have shown that our proposed method can generate better image quality in accelerated MRI than con-ventional undersampling schemes in Cartesian and Non-Cartesian acquisitions.
