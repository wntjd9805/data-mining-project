We propose a novel probabilistic method employingBayesian Model Averaging and self-cycle regularization for spatio-temporal correspondence learning in videos within a self-supervised learning framework. Most existing meth-ods for self-supervised correspondence learning suffer from noisy labels that come with the data for free, and the pres-ence of occlusion exacerbates the problem. We tackle this issue within a probabilistic framework that handles model uncertainty inherent in the path selection problem built on a complete graph. We propose a self-cycle regularization to consider a cycle-consistency property on individual edges in order to prevent converging on noisy matching or trivial solutions. We also utilize a mixture of sequential Bayesian filters to estimate posterior distribution for targets. In ad-dition, we present a domain contrastive loss to learn dis-criminative representation among videos. Our algorithm is evaluated on various datasets for video label propagation tasks including DAVIS2017, VIP and JHMDB, and shows outstanding performances compared to the state-of-the-art self-supervised learning based video correspondence algo-rithms. Moreover, our method converges significantly faster than previous methods.
