In response to the explosively-increasing requirement of annotated data, Novel Class Discovery (NCD) has emerged as a promising alternative to automatically recognize un-known classes without any annotation. To this end, a model makes use of a base set to learn basic semantic discrim-inability that can be transferred to recognize novel classes.Most existing works handle the base and novel sets using separate objectives within a two-stage training paradigm.Despite showing competitive performance on novel classes, they fail to generalize to recognizing samples from both base and novel sets. In this paper, we focus on this gen-eralized setting of NCD (GNCD), and propose to divide and conquer it with two groups of Compositional Experts (ComEx). Each group of experts is designed to character-ize the whole dataset in a comprehensive yet complemen-tary fashion. With their union, we can solve GNCD in an efficient end-to-end manner. We further look into the draw-back in current NCD methods, and propose to strengthenComEx with global-to-local and local-to-local regulariza-tion. ComEx1 is evaluated on four popular benchmarks, showing clear superiority towards the goal of GNCD.
