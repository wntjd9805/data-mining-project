This paper introduces a new matting task called human instance matting (HIM), which requires the pertinent model to automatically predict a precise alpha matte for each hu-man instance. Straightforward combination of closely re-lated techniques, namely, instance segmentation, soft seg-mentation and human/conventional matting, will easily fail in complex cases requiring disentangling mingled colors belonging to multiple instances along hairy and thin bound-ary structures. To tackle these technical challenges, we propose a human instance matting framework, called Inst-Matt, where a novel mutual guidance strategy working in tandem with a multi-instance refinement module is used, for delineating multi-instance relationship among humans with complex and overlapping boundaries if present. A new instance matting metric called instance matting qual-ity (IMQ) is proposed, which addresses the absence of a unified and fair means of evaluation emphasizing both in-stance recognition and matting quality. Finally, we con-struct a HIM benchmark for evaluation, which comprises of both synthetic and natural benchmark images. In addi-tion to thorough experimental results on complex cases with multiple and overlapping human instances each has intri-cate boundaries, preliminary results are presented on gen-eral instance matting. Code and benchmark are available in https://github.com/nowsyn/InstMatt.
