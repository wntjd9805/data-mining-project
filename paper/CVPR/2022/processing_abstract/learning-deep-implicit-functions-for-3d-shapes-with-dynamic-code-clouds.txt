Deep Implicit Function (DIF) has gained popularity as an efficient 3D shape representation. To capture geome-try details, current methods usually learn DIF using lo-cal latent codes, which discretize the space into a reg-ular 3D grid (or octree) and store local codes in grid points (or octree nodes). Given a query point, the local feature is computed by interpolating its neighboring lo-cal codes with their positions. However, the local codes are constrained at discrete and regular positions like grid points, which makes the code positions difficult to be op-timized and limits their representation ability. To solve this problem, we propose to learn DIF with Dynamic CodeCloud, named DCC-DIF. Our method explicitly associates local codes with learnable position vectors, and the posi-tion vectors are continuous and can be dynamically opti-In ad-mized, which improves the representation ability. dition, we propose a novel code position loss to optimize the code positions, which heuristically guides more local codes to be distributed around complex geometric details.In contrast to previous methods, our DCC-DIF represents 3D shapes more efficiently with a small amount of local codes, and improves the reconstruction quality. Experi-ments demonstrate that DCC-DIF achieves better perfor-mance over previous methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/lity20/DCCDIF.
