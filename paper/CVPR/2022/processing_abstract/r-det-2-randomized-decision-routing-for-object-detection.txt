In the paradigm of object detection, the decision head is an important part, which affects detection performance sig-nificantly. Yet how to design a high-performance decision head remains to be an open issue. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel approach to combine decision trees and deep neural networks in an end-to-end learning manner for ob-ject detection. First, we disentangle the decision choices and prediction values by plugging soft decision trees into neural networks. To facilitate effective learning, we pro-pose randomized decision routing with node selective and associative losses, which can boost the feature represen-tative learning and network decision simultaneously. Sec-ond, we develop the decision head for object detection with narrow branches to generate the routing probabilities and masks, for the purpose of obtaining divergent decisions from different nodes. We name this approach as the ran-domized decision routing for object detection, abbreviated as R(Det)2. Experiments on MS-COCO dataset demon-strate that R(Det)2 is effective to improve the detection per-formance. Equipped with existing detectors, it achieves 1.4 âˆ¼ 3.6% AP improvement.
