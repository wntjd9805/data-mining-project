This paper aims to leverage symbolic knowledge to im-prove the performance and interpretability of the Visual Re-lationship Detection (VRD) models. Existing VRD meth-ods based on deep learning suffer from the problems of poor performance on insufficient labeled examples and lack of interpretability. To overcome the aforementioned weak-nesses, we integrate symbolic knowledge into deep learn-ing models and propose a bi-level probabilistic graphical reasoning framework called BPGR. Specifically, in the high-level structure, we take the objects and relationships de-tected by the VRD model as hidden variables (reasoning results); In the low-level structure of BPGR, we use MarkovLogic Networks (MLNs) to project First-Order Logic (FOL) as observed variables (symbolic knowledge) to correct er-ror reasoning results. We adopt a variational EM algorithm for optimization. Experiments results show that our BPGR improves the performance of the VRD models. In particu-lar, BPGR can also provide easy-to-understand insights for reasoning results to show interpretability.
