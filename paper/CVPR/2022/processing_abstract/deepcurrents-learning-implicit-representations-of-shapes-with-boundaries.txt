Recent techniques have been successful in reconstructing surfaces as level sets of learned functions (such as signed dis-tance ﬁelds) parameterized by deep neural networks. Many of these methods, however, learn only closed surfaces and are unable to reconstruct shapes with boundary curves. We propose a hybrid shape representation that combines explicit boundary curves with implicit learned interiors. Using ma-chinery from geometric measure theory, we parameterize currents using deep networks and use stochastic gradient descent to solve a minimal surface problem. By modifying the metric according to target geometry coming, e.g., from a mesh or point cloud, we can use this approach to repre-sent arbitrary surfaces, learning implicitly deﬁned shapes with explicitly deﬁned boundary curves. We further demon-strate learning families of shapes jointly parameterized by boundary curves and latent codes.
