The increasing abuse of image editing softwares, such as Photoshop and Meitu, causes the authenticity of digi-tal images questionable. Meanwhile, the widespread avail-ability of online social networks (OSNs) makes them the dominant channels for transmitting forged images to re-port fake news, propagate rumors, etc. Unfortunately, various lossy operations adopted by OSNs, e.g., compres-sion and resizing, impose great challenges for implement-ing the robust image forgery detection. To ﬁght against theOSN-shared forgeries, in this work, a novel robust train-ing scheme is proposed. We ﬁrst conduct a thorough anal-ysis of the noise introduced by OSNs, and decouple it into two parts, i.e., predictable noise and unseen noise, which are modelled separately. The former simulates the noise introduced by the disclosed (known) operations of OSNs, while the latter is designed to not only complete the pre-vious one, but also take into account the defects of the detector itself. We then incorporate the modelled noise into a robust training framework, signiﬁcantly improving the robustness of the image forgery detector. Extensive ex-perimental results are presented to validate the superior-ity of the proposed scheme compared with several state-of-the-art competitors. Finally, to promote the future de-velopment of the image forgery detection, we build a pub-lic forgeries dataset based on four existing datasets and three most popular OSNs. The designed detector recently won the top ranking in a certiﬁcate forgery detection com-petition1. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HighwayWu/ImageForensicsOSN.
