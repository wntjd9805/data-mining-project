Estimating the accurate depth from a single image is challenging since it is inherently ambiguous and ill-posed.While recent works design increasingly complicated and powerful networks to directly regress the depth map, we take the path of CRFs optimization. Due to the expensive com-putation, CRFs are usually performed between neighbor-hoods rather than the whole graph. To leverage the poten-tial of fully-connected CRFs, we split the input into windows and perform the FC-CRFs optimization within each win-dow, which reduces the computation complexity and makesFC-CRFs feasible. To better capture the relationships be-tween nodes in the graph, we exploit the multi-head atten-tion mechanism to compute a multi-head potential function, which is fed to the networks to output an optimized depth map. Then we build a bottom-up-top-down structure, where this neural window FC-CRFs module serves as the decoder, and a vision transformer serves as the encoder. The ex-periments demonstrate that our method signiÔ¨Åcantly im-proves the performance across all metrics on both the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets, compared to previous methods. Fur-thermore, the proposed method can be directly applied to panorama images and outperforms all previous panorama methods on the MatterPort3D dataset. 1
