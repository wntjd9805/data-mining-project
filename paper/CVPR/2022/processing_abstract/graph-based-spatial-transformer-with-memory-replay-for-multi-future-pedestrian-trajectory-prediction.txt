Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an essential and chal-lenging task for a variety of real-life applications such as autonomous driving and robotic motion planning. Besides generating a single future path, predicting multiple plausi-ble future paths is becoming popular in some recent work on trajectory prediction. However, existing methods typ-ically emphasize spatial interactions between pedestrians and surrounding areas but ignore the smoothness and tem-poral consistency of predictions. Our model aims to fore-cast multiple paths based on a historical trajectory by mod-eling multi-scale graph-based spatial transformers com-bined with a trajectory smoothing algorithm named “Mem-ory Replay” utilizing a memory graph. Our method can comprehensively exploit the spatial information as well as correct the temporally inconsistent trajectories (e.g., sharp turns). We also propose a new evaluation metric named“Percentage of Trajectory Usage” to evaluate the compre-hensiveness of diverse multi-future predictions. Our exten-sive experiments show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-future prediction and competitive results for single-future prediction.
