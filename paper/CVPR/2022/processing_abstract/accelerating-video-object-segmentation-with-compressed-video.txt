We propose an efficient plug-and-play acceleration framework for semi-supervised video object segmentation by exploiting the temporal redundancies in videos presented by the compressed bitstream. Specifically, we propose a motion vector-based warping method for propagating seg-mentation masks from keyframes to other frames in a bi-directional and multi-hop manner. Additionally, we in-troduce a residual-based correction module that can fix wrongly propagated segmentation masks from noisy or er-roneous motion vectors. Our approach is flexible and can be added on top of several existing video object segmenta-tion algorithms. We achieved highly competitive results onDAVIS17 and YouTube-VOS on various base models with substantial speed-ups of up to 3.5X with minor drops in ac-curacy. 1
