Appearance-based gaze estimation aims to predict the 3D eye gaze direction from a single image. While recent deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated excel-lent performance, they usually assume one calibrated face in each input image and cannot output multi-person gaze in real time. However, simultaneous gaze estimation for mul-tiple people in the wild is necessary for real-world appli-cations. In this paper, we propose the first one-stage end-to-end gaze estimation method, GazeOnce, which is capa-ble of simultaneously predicting gaze directions for multiple faces (>10) in an image. In addition, we design a sophisti-cated data generation pipeline and propose a new dataset,MPSGaze, which contains full images of multiple people with 3D gaze ground truth. Experimental results demon-strate that our unified framework not only offers a faster speed, but also provides a lower gaze estimation error com-pared with state-of-the-art methods. This technique can be useful in real-time applications with multiple users.
