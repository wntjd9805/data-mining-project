Image deblurring is an ill-posed problem with multiple plausible solutions for a given input image. However, most existing methods produce a deterministic estimate of the clean image and are trained to minimize pixel-level dis-tortion. These metrics are known to be poorly correlated with human perception, and often lead to unrealistic recon-structions. We present an alternative framework for blind deblurring based on conditional diffusion models. Unlike ex-isting techniques, we train a stochastic sampler that reﬁnes the output of a deterministic predictor and is capable of pro-ducing a diverse set of plausible reconstructions for a given input. This leads to a signiﬁcant improvement in perceptual quality over existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple standard benchmarks. Our predict-and-reﬁne approach also enables much more efﬁcient sampling compared to typical diffusion models. Combined with a carefully tuned network architecture and inference procedure, our method is com-petitive in terms of distortion metrics such as PSNR. These results show clear beneﬁts of our diffusion-based method for deblurring and challenge the widely used strategy of producing a single, deterministic reconstruction.
