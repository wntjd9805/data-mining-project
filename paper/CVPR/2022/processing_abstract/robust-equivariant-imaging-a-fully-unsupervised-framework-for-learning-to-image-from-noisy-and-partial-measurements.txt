Deep networks provide state-of-the-art performance in multiple imaging inverse problems ranging from medical imaging to computational photography. However, most ex-isting networks are trained with clean signals which are often hard or impossible to obtain. Equivariant imaging (EI) is a recent self-supervised learning framework that ex-ploits the group invariance present in signal distributions to learn a reconstruction function from partial measure-ment data alone. While EI results are impressive, its per-formance degrades with increasing noise.In this paper, we propose a Robust Equivariant Imaging (REI) framework which can learn to image from noisy partial measurements alone. The proposed method uses Steinâ€™s Unbiased RiskEstimator (SURE) to obtain a fully unsupervised training loss that is robust to noise. We show that REI leads to considerable performance gains on linear and nonlinear inverse problems, thereby paving the way for robust unsu-pervised imaging with deep networks.
