Multi-agent trajectory prediction is critical for planning and decision-making in human-interactive autonomous sys-tems, such as self-driving cars. However, most prediction models are developed separately from their upstream per-ception (detection and tracking) modules, assuming ground truth past trajectories as inputs. As a result, their perfor-mance degrades significantly when using real-world noisy tracking results as inputs. This is typically caused by the propagation of errors from tracking to prediction, such as noisy tracks, fragments and identity switches. To allevi-ate this propagation of errors, we propose a new predic-tion paradigm that uses detections and their affinity matri-ces across frames as inputs, removing the need for error-prone data association during tracking. Since affinity ma-trices contain “soft” information about the similarity and identity of detections across frames, making prediction di-rectly from affinity matrices retains strictly more informa-tion than making prediction from the tracklets generated by data association. Experiments on large-scale, real-world autonomous driving datasets show that our affinity-based prediction scheme1 reduces overall prediction errors by up to 57.9%, in comparison to standard prediction pipelines that use tracklets as inputs, with even more significant er-ror reduction (up to 88.6%) if restricting the evaluation to challenging scenarios with tracking errors.
