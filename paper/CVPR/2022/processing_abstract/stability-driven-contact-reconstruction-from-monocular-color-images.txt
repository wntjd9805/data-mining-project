Physical contact provides additional constraints for hand-object state reconstruction as well as a basis for fur-ther understanding of interaction affordances. Estimat-ing these severely occluded regions from monocular images presents a considerable challenge. Existing methods op-timize the hand-object contact driven by distance thresh-old or prior from contact-labeled datasets. However, due to the number of subjects and objects involved in these in-door datasets being limited, the learned contact patterns could not be generalized easily. Our key idea is to recon-struct the contact pattern directly from monocular images, and then utilize the physical stability criterion in the simula-tion to optimize it. This criterion is deÔ¨Åned by the resultant forces and contact distribution computed by the physics en-gine. Compared to existing solutions, our framework can be adapted to more personalized hands and diverse ob-ject shapes. Furthermore, an interaction dataset with ex-tra physical attributes is created to verify the sim-to-real consistency of our methods. Through comprehensive evalu-ations, hand-object contact can be reconstructed with both accuracy and stability by the proposed framework.
