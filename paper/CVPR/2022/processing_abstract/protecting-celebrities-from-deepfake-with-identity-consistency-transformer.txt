In this work we propose Identity Consistency Trans-former, a novel face forgery detection method that focuses on high-level semantics, speciﬁcally identity information, and detecting a suspect face by ﬁnding identity inconsis-tency in inner and outer face regions. The Identity Consis-tency Transformer incorporates a consistency loss for iden-tity consistency determination. We show that Identity Con-sistency Transformer exhibits superior generalization abil-ity not only across different datasets but also across various types of image degradation forms found in real-world appli-cations including deepfake videos. The Identity ConsistencyTransformer can be easily enhanced with additional identity information when such information is available, and for this reason it is especially well-suited for detecting face forg-eries involving celebrities. 1
