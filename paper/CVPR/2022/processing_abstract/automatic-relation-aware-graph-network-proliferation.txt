Graph neural architecture search has sparked much at-tention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown powerful reasoning capability in many relational tasks.However, the currently used graph search space overem-phasizes learning node features and neglects mining hi-erarchical relational information. Moreover, due to di-verse mechanisms in the message passing, the graph search space is much larger than that of CNNs. This hinders the straightforward application of classical search strate-gies for exploring complicated graph search space. We propose Automatic Relation-aware Graph Network Pro-liferation (ARGNP) for efficiently searching GNNs with a relation-guided message passing mechanism. Specifi-cally, we first devise a novel dual relation-aware graph search space that comprises both node and relation learn-ing operations. These operations can extract hierarchical node/relational information and provide anisotropic guid-ance for message passing on a graph. Second, analo-gous to cell proliferation, we design a network proliferation search paradigm to progressively determine the GNN archi-tectures by iteratively performing network division and dif-ferentiation. The experiments on six datasets for four graph learning tasks demonstrate that GNNs produced by our method are superior to the current state-of-the-art hand-crafted and search-based GNNs.
