Rigged puppets are one of the most prevalent represen-tations to create 2D character animations. Creating these puppets requires partitioning characters into independently moving parts. In this work, we present a method to auto-matically identify such articulated parts from a small set of character poses shown in a sprite sheet, which is an il-lustration of the character that artists often draw before puppet creation. Our method is trained to infer articu-lated parts, e.g. head, torso and limbs, that can be re-assembled to best reconstruct the given poses. Our re-sults demonstrate significantly better performance than al-ternatives qualitatively and quantitatively. Our project page https://zhan- xu.github.io/parts/ includes our code and data.
