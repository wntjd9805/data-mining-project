We present a novel one-shot method for object detection and 6 DoF pose estimation, that does not require training on target objects. At test time, it takes as input a target im-age and a textured 3D query model. The core idea is to represent a 3D model with a number of 2D templates ren-dered from different viewpoints. This enables CNN-based direct dense feature extraction and matching. The object isﬁrst localized in 2D, then its approximate viewpoint is es-timated, followed by dense 2D-3D correspondence predic-tion. The ﬁnal pose is computed with PnP. We evaluate the method on LineMOD, Occlusion, Homebrewed, YCB-V andTLESS datasets and report very competitive performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods trained on syn-thetic data, even though our method is not trained on the object models used for testing.
