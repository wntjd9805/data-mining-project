at https://github.com/raven38/OSSGAN .We introduce a challenging training scheme of condi-tional GANs, called open-set semi-supervised image gen-eration, where the training dataset consists of two parts: (i) labeled data and (ii) unlabeled data with samples belong-ing to one of the labeled data classes, namely, a closed-set, and samples not belonging to any of the labeled data classes, namely, an open-set. Unlike the existing semi-supervised image generation task, where unlabeled data only contain closed-set samples, our task is more general and lowers the data collection cost in practice by allow-ing open-set samples to appear. Thanks to entropy regu-larization, the classiﬁer that is trained on labeled data is able to quantify sample-wise importance to the training of cGAN as conﬁdence, allowing us to use all samples in un-labeled data. We design OSSGAN, which provides decision clues to the discriminator on the basis of whether an unla-beled image belongs to one or none of the classes of inter-est, smoothly integrating labeled and unlabeled data during training. The results of experiments on Tiny ImageNet andImageNet show notable improvements over supervised Big-GAN and semi-supervised methods. Our code is available
