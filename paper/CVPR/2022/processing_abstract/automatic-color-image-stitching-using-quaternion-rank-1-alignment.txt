Color image stitching is a challenging task in real-world applications. This paper first proposes a quaternion rank-1 alignment (QR1A) model for high-precision color image alignment. To solve the optimization problem of QR1A, we develop a nested iterative algorithm under the framework of complex-valued alternating direction method of multipliers.To quantitatively evaluate image stitching performance, we propose a perceptual seam quality (PSQ) measure to calcu-late misalignments of local regions along the seamline. Us-ing QR1A and PSQ, we further propose an automatic colorIn this frame-image stitching (ACIS-QR1A) framework. work, the automatic strategy and iterative learning strategy are developed to simultaneously learn the optimal seamline and local alignment. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed ACIS-QR1A is able to obtain high-quality stitched images under several diffi-cult scenarios including large parallax, low textures, mov-ing objects, large occlusions or/and their combinations.
