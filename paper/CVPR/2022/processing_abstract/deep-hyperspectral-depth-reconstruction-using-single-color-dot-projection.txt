Depth reconstruction and hyperspectral reﬂectance re-construction are two active research topics in computer vi-sion and image processing. Conventionally, these two top-ics have been studied separately using independent imag-ing setups and there is no existing method which can ac-quire depth and spectral reﬂectance simultaneously in one shot without using special hardware. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel single-shot hyperspectral-depth reconstruc-tion method using an off-the-shelf RGB camera and projec-tor. Our method is based on a single color-dot projection, which simultaneously acts as structured light for depth re-construction and spatially-varying color illuminations for hyperspectral reﬂectance reconstruction. To jointly recon-struct the depth and the hyperspectral reﬂectance from a single color-dot image, we propose a novel end-to-end net-work architecture that effectively incorporates a geometric color-dot pattern loss and a photometric hyperspectral re-ﬂectance loss. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that our hyperspectral-depth reconstruction method outper-forms the combination of an existing state-of-the-art single-shot hyperspectral reﬂectance reconstruction method and depth reconstruction method.
