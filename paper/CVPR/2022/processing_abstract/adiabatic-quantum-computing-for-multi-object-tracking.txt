Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is most often approached in the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where object detec-tions are associated through time. The association step nat-urally leads to discrete optimization problems. As these optimization problems are often NP-hard, they can only be solved exactly for small instances on current hard-ware. Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) offers a solu-tion for this, as it has the potential to provide a consid-erable speedup on a range of NP-hard optimization prob-lems in the near future. However, current MOT formulations are unsuitable for quantum computing due to their scaling properties. In this work, we therefore propose the Ô¨Årst MOT formulation designed to be solved with AQC. We employ anIsing model that represents the quantum mechanical sys-tem implemented on the AQC. We show that our approach is competitive compared with state-of-the-art optimization-based approaches, even when using of-the-shelf integer pro-gramming solvers. Finally, we demonstrate that our MOT problem is already solvable on the current generation of real quantum computers for small examples, and analyze the properties of the measured solutions.
