Synthesizing pseudo samples is currently the most ef-fective way to solve the Generalized Zero Shot Learning (GZSL) problem. Most models achieve competitive per-formance but still suffer from two problems: (1) Feature confounding, the overall representations confound task-correlated and task-independent features, and existing mod-els disentangle them in a generative way, but they are unrea-sonable to synthesize reliable pseudo samples with limited samples; (2) Distribution uncertainty, that massive data is needed when existing models synthesize samples from the uncertain distribution, which causes poor performance in limited samples of seen classes. In this paper, we propose a non-generative model to address these problems corre-spondingly in two modules: (1) Task-correlated feature dis-entanglement, to exclude the task-correlated features from task-independent ones by adversarial learning of domain adaption towards reasonable synthesis; (2) Controllable pseudo sample synthesis, to synthesize edge-pseudo and center-pseudo samples with certain characteristics towards more diversity generated and intuitive transfer.In adda-tion, to describe the new scene that is the limit seen class samples in the training process, we further formulate a newZSL task named the ‘Few-shot Seen class and Zero-shot Un-seen class learning’ (FSZU). Extensive experiments on four benchmarks verify that the proposed method is competitive in the GZSL and the FSZU tasks.
