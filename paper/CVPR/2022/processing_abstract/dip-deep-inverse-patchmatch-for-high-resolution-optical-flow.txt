Recently, the dense correlation volume method achieves state-of-the-art performance in optical ﬂow. However, the correlation volume computation requires a lot of memory, which makes prediction difﬁcult on high-resolution images.In this paper, we propose a novel Patchmatch-based frame-work to work on high-resolution optical ﬂow estimation.Speciﬁcally, we introduce the ﬁrst end-to-end Patchmatch based deep learning optical ﬂow. It can get high-precision results with lower memory beneﬁting from propagation and local search of Patchmatch. Furthermore, a new inverse propagation is proposed to decouple the complex opera-tions of propagation, which can signiﬁcantly reduce calcu-lations in multiple iterations. At the time of submission, our method ranks 1st on all the metrics on the popularKITTI2015 [28] benchmark , and ranks 2nd on EPE on the Sintel [7] clean benchmark among published opticalﬂow methods. Experiment shows our method has a strong cross-dataset generalization ability that the F1-all achieves 13.73%, reducing 21% from the best published result 17.4% on KITTI2015. What’s more, our method shows a good de-tails preserving result on the high-resolution dataset DAVIS[1] and consumes 2× less memory than RAFT [36]. Code will be available at github.com/zihuazheng/DIP
