We present IterMVS, a new data-driven method for high-resolution multi-view stereo. We propose a novel GRU-based estimator that encodes pixel-wise probability dis-Ingesting multi-tributions of depth in its hidden state. scale matching information, our model reﬁnes these distri-butions over multiple iterations and infers depth and conﬁ-dence. To extract the depth maps, we combine traditional classiﬁcation and regression in a novel manner. We ver-ify the efﬁciency and effectiveness of our method on DTU,Tanks&Temples and ETH3D. While being the most efﬁcient method in both memory and run-time, our model achieves competitive performance on DTU and better generalization ability on Tanks&Temples as well as ETH3D than most state-of-the-art methods.
