Clinical outcome or severity prediction from medical im-ages has largely focused on learning representations from single-timepoint or snapshot scans. It has been shown that disease progression can be better characterized by tempo-ral imaging. We therefore hypothesized that outcome pre-dictions can be improved by utilizing the disease progres-sion information from sequential images. We present a deep learning approach that leverages temporal progression in-formation to improve clinical outcome predictions fromIn our method, a self-attention single-timepoint images. based Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is used to learn a representation that is most reflective of the disease trajectory. Meanwhile, a Vision Transformer is pretrained in a self-supervised fashion to extract features from single-timepoint images. The key contribution is to design a recal-ibration module that employs maximum mean discrepancy loss (MMD) to align distributions of the above two contex-tual representations. We train our system to predict clini-cal outcomes and severity grades from single-timepoint im-ages. Experiments on chest and osteoarthritis radiography datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques.
