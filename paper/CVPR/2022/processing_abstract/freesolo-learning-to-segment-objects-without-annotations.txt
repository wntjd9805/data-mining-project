Instance segmentation is a fundamental vision task that aims to recognize and segment each object in an image. it requires costly annotations such as bound-However, ing boxes and segmentation masks for learning.In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised learning method that learns class-agnostic instance segmentation without any annotations. We present FreeSOLO, a self-supervised instance segmentation framework built on top of the sim-ple instance segmentation method SOLO. Our method also presents a novel localization-aware pre-training frame-work, where objects can be discovered from complicated scenes in an unsupervised manner. FreeSOLO achieves 9.8% AP50 on the challenging COCO dataset, which even outperforms several segmentation proposal methods time, we that use manual annotations. demonstrate unsupervised class-agnostic instance segmen-tation successfully.
