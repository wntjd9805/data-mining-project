Recent studies on StyleGAN show high performance on artistic portrait generation by transfer learning with limited data. In this paper, we explore more challenging exemplar-based high-resolution portrait style transfer by introduc-ing a novel DualStyleGAN with flexible control of dual styles of the original face domain and the extended artistic portrait domain. Different from StyleGAN, DualStyleGAN provides a natural way of style transfer by characterizing the content and style of a portrait with an intrinsic style path and a new extrinsic style path, respectively. The del-icately designed extrinsic style path enables our model to modulate both the color and complex structural styles hi-erarchically to precisely pastiche the style example. Fur-thermore, a novel progressive fine-tuning scheme is intro-duced to smoothly transform the generative space of the model to the target domain, even with the above modifica-tions on the network architecture. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of DualStyleGAN over state-of-the-art meth-ods in high-quality portrait style transfer and flexible style control.
