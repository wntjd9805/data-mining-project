Large-scale pre-training has been proven to be cru-cial for various computer vision tasks. However, with the increase of pre-training data amount, model architecture amount, and the private/inaccessible data, it is not very efficient or possible to pre-train all the model architec-tures on large-scale datasets.In this work, we investi-gate an alternative strategy for pre-training, namely Knowl-edge Distillation as Efficient Pre-training (KDEP), aim-ing to efficiently transfer the learned feature representa-tion from existing pre-trained models to new student mod-els for future downstream tasks. We observe that existingKnowledge Distillation (KD) methods are unsuitable to-wards pre-training since they normally distill the logits that are going to be discarded when transferred to downstream tasks. To resolve this problem, we propose a feature-basedKD method with non-parametric feature dimension align-ing. Notably, our method performs comparably with su-pervised pre-training counterparts in 3 downstream tasks and 9 downstream datasets requiring 10× less data and 5× less pre-training time.
