Energy-based latent variable models (EBLVMs) are more expressive than conventional energy-based models.However, its potential on visual tasks are limited by its training process based on maximum likelihood estimate that requires sampling from two intractable distributions.In this paper, we propose Bi-level doubly variational learn-ing (BiDVL), which is based on a new bi-level optimiza-tion framework and two tractable variational distributions to facilitate learning EBLVMs. Particularly, we lead a de-coupled EBLVM consisting of a marginal energy-based dis-tribution and a structural posterior to handle the difÔ¨Åculties when learning deep EBLVMs on images. By choosing a symmetric KL divergence in the lower level of our frame-work, a compact BiDVL for visual tasks can be obtained.Our model achieves impressive image generation perfor-mance over related works. It also demonstrates the signif-icant capacity of testing image reconstruction and out-of-distribution detection.
