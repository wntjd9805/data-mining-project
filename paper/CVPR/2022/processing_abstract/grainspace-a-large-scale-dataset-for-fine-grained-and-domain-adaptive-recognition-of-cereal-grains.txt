Cereal grains are a vital part of human diets and are important commodities for people’s livelihood and interna-tional trade. Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) serves as one of the crucial steps for the determination of grain qual-ity and grain stratiﬁcation for proper circulation, storage and food processing, etc. GAI is routinely performed manu-ally by qualiﬁed inspectors with the aid of some hand tools.Automated GAI has the beneﬁt of greatly assisting inspec-tors with their jobs but has been limited due to the lack of datasets and clear deﬁnitions of the tasks.In this paper we formulate GAI as three ubiquitous com-puter vision tasks: ﬁne-grained recognition, domain adap-tation and out-of-distribution recognition. We present a large-scale and publicly available cereal grains dataset called GrainSpace. Speciﬁcally, we construct three types of device prototypes for data acquisition, and a total of 5.25 million images determined by professional inspectors.The grain samples including wheat, maize and rice are collected from ﬁve countries and more than 30 regions.We also develop a comprehensive benchmark based on semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning tech-niques. To the best of our knowledge, GrainSpace is theﬁrst publicly released dataset for cereal grain inspection, https://github.com/hellodfan/GrainSpace.
