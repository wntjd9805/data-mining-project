After the 2017 TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge, its dataset and evaluation based on accuracy and F1 score have become the de facto standard to measure the perfor-mance of lane detection methods. While they have played a major role in improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this evaluation method in down-stream tasks has not been adequately researched. In this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection: End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on the requirements of au-tonomous driving, a core downstream task of lane detec-tion; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evalu-ate the validity of the metrics, we conduct a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection ap-proaches on the TuSimple dataset and our newly con-structed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations (â‰¤-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improve-ments purely targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements in autonomous driv-ing, but rather may actually have made it worse by over-fitting to the conventional metrics. As autonomous driving is a security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the sound development of practical lane detection models. We hope that our study will help the com-munity achieve more downstream task-aware evaluations for lane detection.
