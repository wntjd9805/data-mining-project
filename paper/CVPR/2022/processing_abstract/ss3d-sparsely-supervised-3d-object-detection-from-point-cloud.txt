TrainingInferenceConventional deep learning based methods for 3D object detection require a large amount of 3D bounding box anno-tations for training, which is expensive to obtain in practice.Sparsely annotated object detection, which can largely re-duce the annotations, is very challenging since the missing-annotated instances would be regarded as the background during training.In this paper, we propose a sparsely-supervised 3D object detection method, named SS3D. Aim-ing to eliminate the negative supervision caused by the missing annotations, we design a missing-annotated in-stance mining module with strict ﬁltering strategies to mine positive instances. In the meantime, we design a reliable background mining module and a point cloud ﬁlling data augmentation strategy to generate the conﬁdent data for it-eratively learning with reliable supervision. The proposedSS3D is a general framework that can be used to learn any modern 3D object detector. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset reveal that on different 3D detectors, the proposed SS3D framework with only 20% annotations re-quired can achieve on-par performance comparing to fully-supervised methods. Comparing with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised 3D objection detection on KITTI, our SS3D improves the benchmarks by signiﬁcant margins under the same annotation workload. Moreover, our SS3D also out-performs the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised method by remarkable margins, highlighting its effectiveness.
