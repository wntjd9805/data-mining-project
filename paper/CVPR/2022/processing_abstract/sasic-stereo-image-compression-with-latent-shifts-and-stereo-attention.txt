We propose a learned method for stereo image com-pression that leverages the similarity of the left and right images in a stereo pair due to overlapping fields of view.The left image is compressed by a learned compression method based on an autoencoder with a hyperprior entropy model. The right image uses this information from the pre-viously encoded left image in both the encoding and decod-In particular, for the right image, we encode ing stages. only the residual of its latent representation to the opti-mally shifted latent of the left image. On top of that, we also employ a stereo attention module to connect left and right images during decoding. The performance of the pro-posed method is evaluated on two benchmark stereo image datasets (Cityscapes and InStereo2K) and outperforms pre-vious stereo image compression methods while being signif-icantly smaller in model size.
