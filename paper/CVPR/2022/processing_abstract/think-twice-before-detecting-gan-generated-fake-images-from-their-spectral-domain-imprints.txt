Accurate detection of the fake but photorealistic images is one of the most challenging tasks to address social, bio-metrics security and privacy related concerns in our com-munity. Earlier research has underlined the existence of spectral domain artifacts in fake images generated by pow-erful generative adversarial network (GAN) based meth-ods. Therefore, a number of highly accurate frequency do-main methods to detect such GAN generated images have been proposed in the literature. Our study in this paper in-troduces a pipeline to mitigate the spectral artifacts. We show from our experiments that the artifacts in frequency spectrum of such fake images can be mitigated by proposed methods, which leads to the sharp decrease of performance of spectrum-based detectors. This paper also presents ex-perimental results using a large database of images that are synthesized using BigGAN, CRN, CycleGAN, IMLE, Pro-GAN, StarGAN, StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 (including syn-thesized high resolution fingerprint images) to illustrate ef-fectiveness of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we se-lect a spatial-domain based fake image detector and ob-serve a notable decrease in the detection performance when proposed method is incorporated. In summary, our insight-ful analysis and pipeline presented in this paper cautions the forensic community on the reliability of GAN-generated fake image detectors that are based on the analysis of fre-quency artifacts as these artifacts can be easily mitigated.
