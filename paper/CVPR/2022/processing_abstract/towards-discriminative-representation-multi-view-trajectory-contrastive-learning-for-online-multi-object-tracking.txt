Discriminative representation is crucial for the associ-ation step in multi-object tracking. Recent work mainly utilizes features in single or neighboring frames for con-structing metric loss and empowering networks to extract representation of targets. Although this strategy is effec-tive, it fails to fully exploit the information contained in a whole trajectory. To this end, we propose a strategy, namely multi-view trajectory contrastive learning, in which each trajectory is represented as a center vector. By maintain-ing all the vectors in a dynamically updated memory bank, a trajectory-level contrastive loss is devised to explore the inter-frame information in the whole trajectories. Besides, in this strategy, each target is represented as multiple adap-tively selected keypoints rather than a pre-defined anchor or center. This design allows the network to generate richer representation from multiple views of the same target, which can better characterize occluded objects. Additionally, in the inference stage, a similarity-guided feature fusion strat-egy is developed for further boosting the quality of the tra-jectory representation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on MOTChallenge to verify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. The experimental results indicate that our method has surpassed preceding trackers and es-tablished new state-of-the-art performance.
