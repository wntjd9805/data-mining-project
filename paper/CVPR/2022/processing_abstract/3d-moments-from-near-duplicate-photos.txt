We introduce 3D Moments, a new computational photog-raphy effect. As input we take a pair of near-duplicate photos, i.e., photos of moving subjects from similar viewpoints, com-mon in people’s photo collections. As output, we produce a video that smoothly interpolates the scene motion from the ﬁrst photo to the second, while also producing camera motion with parallax that gives a heightened sense of 3D.To achieve this effect, we represent the scene as a pair of feature-based layered depth images augmented with sceneﬂow. This representation enables motion interpolation along with independent control of the camera viewpoint. Our sys-tem produces photorealistic space-time videos with motion parallax and scene dynamics, while plausibly recovering regions occluded in the original views. We conduct exten-sive experiments demonstrating superior performance over baselines on public datasets and in-the-wild photos. Project page: https://3d-moments.github.io/.
