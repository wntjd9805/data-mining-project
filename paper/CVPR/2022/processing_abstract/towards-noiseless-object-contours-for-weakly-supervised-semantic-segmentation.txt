Image-level label based weakly supervised semantic seg-mentation has attracted much attention since image la-bels are very easy to obtain. Existing methods usually generate pseudo labels from class activation map (CAM) and then train a segmentation model. CAM usually high-lights partial objects and produce incomplete pseudo la-bels. Some methods explore object contour by training a contour model with CAM seed label supervision and then propagate CAM score from discriminative regions to non-discriminative regions with contour guidance. The prop-agation process suffers from the noisy intra-object con-tours, and inadequate propagation results produce incom-plete pseudo labels. This is because the coarse CAM seed label lacks sufficient precise semantic information to sup-press contour noise. In this paper, we train a SANCE model which utilizes an auxiliary segmentation module to sup-plement high-level semantic information for contour train-ing by backbone feature sharing and online label super-vision. The auxiliary segmentation module also provides more accurate localization map than CAM for pseudo la-bel generation. We evaluate our approach on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.
