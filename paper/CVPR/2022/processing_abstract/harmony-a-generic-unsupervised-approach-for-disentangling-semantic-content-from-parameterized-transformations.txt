In many real-life image analysis applications, particu-larly in biomedical research domains, the objects of inter-est undergo multiple transformations that alters their visual properties while keeping the semantic content unchanged.Disentangling images into semantic content factors and transformations can provide significant benefits into many domain-specific image analysis tasks. To this end, we pro-pose a generic unsupervised framework, Harmony, that simultaneously and explicitly disentangles semantic con-tent from multiple parameterized transformations. Har-mony leverages a simple cross-contrastive learning frame-work with multiple explicitly parameterized latent repre-sentations to disentangle content from transformations. To demonstrate the efficacy of Harmony, we apply it to disen-tangle image semantic content from several parameterized transformations (rotation, translation, scaling, and con-trast). Harmony achieves significantly improved disentan-glement over the baseline models on several image datasets of diverse domains. With such disentanglement, Harmony is demonstrated to incentivize bioimage analysis research by modeling structural heterogeneity of macromolecules from cryo-ET images and learning transformation-invariant rep-resentations of protein particles from single-particle cryo-EM images. Harmony also performs very well in disen-tangling content from 3D transformations and can perform coarse and fast alignment of 3D cryo-ET subtomograms.Therefore, Harmony is generalizable to many other imag-ing domains and can potentially be extended to domains beyond imaging as well.
