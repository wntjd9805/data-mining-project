Point cloud scene flow estimation is of practical impor-tance for dynamic scene navigation in autonomous driving.Since scene flow labels are hard to obtain, current meth-ods train their models on synthetic data and transfer them to real scenes. However, large disparities between existing synthetic datasets and real scenes lead to poor model trans-fer. We make two major contributions to address that. First, we develop a point cloud collector and scene flow annotator for GTA-V engine to automatically obtain diverse realistic training samples without human intervention. With that, we develop a large-scale synthetic scene flow dataset GTA-SF.Second, we propose a mean-teacher-based domain adapta-tion framework that leverages self-generated pseudo-labels of the target domain. It also explicitly incorporates shape deformation regularization and surface correspondence re-finement to address distortions and misalignments in do-main transfer. Through extensive experiments, we show that our GTA-SF dataset leads to a consistent boost in model generalization to three real datasets (i.e., Waymo, Lyft andKITTI) as compared to the most widely used FT3D dataset.Moreover, our framework achieves superior adaptation per-formance on six source-target dataset pairs, remarkably closing the average domain gap by 60%.
