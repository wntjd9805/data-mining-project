In portraits, eyeglasses may occlude facial regions and generate cast shadows on faces, which degrades the per-formance of many techniques like face veriﬁcation and ex-pression recognition. Portrait eyeglasses removal is criti-cal in handling these problems. However, completely re-moving the eyeglasses is challenging because the lighting effects (e.g., cast shadows) caused by them are often com-plex. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to re-move eyeglasses as well as their cast shadows from face images. The method works in a detect-then-remove manner, in which eyeglasses and cast shadows are both detected and then removed from images. Due to the lack of paired data for supervised training, we present a new synthetic por-trait dataset with both intermediate and ﬁnal supervisions for both the detection and removal tasks. Furthermore, we apply a cross-domain technique to ﬁll the gap between the synthetic and real data. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed technique is the ﬁrst to remove eyeglasses and their cast shadows simultaneously. The code and syn-thetic dataset are available at https://github.com/StoryMY/take-off-eyeglasses.
