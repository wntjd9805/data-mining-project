This paper proposes the first real-world rolling shut-ter (RS) correction dataset, BS-RSC, and a corresponding model to correct the RS frames in a distorted video. Mo-bile devices in the consumer market with CMOS-based sen-sors for video capture often result in rolling shutter effects when relative movements occur during the video acquisition process, calling for RS effect removal techniques. How-ever, current state-of-the-art RS correction methods often fail to remove RS effects in real scenarios since the mo-tions are various and hard to model. To address this issue, we propose a real-world RS correction dataset BS-RSC.Real distorted videos with corresponding ground truth are recorded simultaneously via a well-designed beam-splitter-based acquisition system. BS-RSC contains various mo-tions of both camera and objects in dynamic scenes. Fur-ther, an RS correction model with adaptive warping is pro-posed. Our model can warp the learned RS features into global shutter counterparts adaptively with predicted mul-tiple displacement fields. These warped features are aggre-gated and then reconstructed into high-quality global shut-ter frames in a coarse-to-fine strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and our dataset can improve the modelâ€™s ability to remove theRS effects in the real world.
