An object’s interior material properties, while invisible to the human eye, determine motion observed on its sur-face. We propose an approach that estimates heterogeneous material properties of an object from a monocular video of its surface vibrations. Specifically, we show how to es-timate Young’s modulus and density throughout a 3D ob-ject with known geometry. Knowledge of how these val-ues change across the object is useful for simulating its motion and characterizing any defects. Traditional non-destructive testing approaches, which often require expen-sive instruments, generally estimate only homogenized ma-terial properties or simply identify the presence of defects.In contrast, our approach leverages monocular video to (1) identify image-space modes from an object’s sub-pixel mo-tion, and (2) directly infer spatially-varying Young’s modu-lus and density values from the observed modes. We demon-strate our approach on both simulated and real videos.
