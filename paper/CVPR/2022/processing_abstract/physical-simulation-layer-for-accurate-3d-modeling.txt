Baseline DeepSDF [32]We introduce a novel approach for generative 3D mod-eling that explicitly encourages the physical and thus func-tional consistency of the generated shapes. To this end, we advocate the use of online physical simulation as part of learning a generative model. Unlike previous related meth-ods, our approach is trained end-to-end with a fully differ-entiable physical simulator in the training loop. We accom-plish this by leveraging recent advances in differentiable programming, and introducing a fully differentiable point-based physical simulation layer, which accurately evaluates the shapeâ€™s stability when subjected to gravity. We then incorporate this layer in a signed distance function (SDF) shape decoder. By augmenting a conventional SDF decoder with our simulation layer, we demonstrate through exten-sive experiments that online physical simulation improves the accuracy, visual plausibility and physical validity of the resulting shapes, while requiring no additional data or an-notation effort.
