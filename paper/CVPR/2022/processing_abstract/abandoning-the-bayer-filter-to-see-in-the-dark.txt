Low-light image enhancement, a pervasive but challeng-ing problem, plays a central role in enhancing the visi-bility of an image captured in a poor illumination envi-ronment. Due to the fact that not all photons can pass the Bayer-Filter on the sensor of the color camera, in this work, we first present a De-Bayer-Filter simulator based on deep neural networks to generate a monochrome raw image from the colored raw image. Next, a fully convolu-tional network is proposed to achieve the low-light image enhancement by fusing colored raw data with synthesized monochrome data. Channel-wise attention is also intro-duced to the fusion process to establish a complementary interaction between features from colored and monochrome raw images. To train the convolutional networks, we pro-pose a dataset with monochrome and color raw pairs namedMono-Colored Raw paired dataset (MCR) collected by us-ing a monochrome camera without Bayer-Filter and a color camera with Bayer-Filter. The proposed pipeline takes ad-vantages of the fusion of the virtual monochrome and the color raw images, and our extensive experiments indicate that significant improvement can be achieved by leverag-ing raw sensor data and data-driven learning.
