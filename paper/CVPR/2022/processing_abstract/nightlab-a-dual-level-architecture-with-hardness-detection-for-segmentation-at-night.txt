The semantic segmentation of nighttime scenes is a chal-lenging problem that is key to impactful applications like self-driving cars. Yet, it has received little attention com-pared to its daytime counterpart.In this paper, we pro-pose NightLab, a novel nighttime segmentation frame-work that leverages multiple deep learning models imbued with night-aware features to yield State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on multiple night segmentation benchmarks.Notably, NightLab contains models at two levels of gran-ularity, i.e. image and regional, and each level is com-posed of light adaptation and segmentation modules. Given a nighttime image, the image level model provides an ini-tial segmentation estimate while, in parallel, a hardness detection module identiﬁes regions and their surrounding context that need further analysis. A regional level model focuses on these difﬁcult regions to provide a signiﬁcantly improved segmentation. All the models in NightLab are trained end-to-end using a set of proposed night-aware losses without handcrafted heuristics. Extensive experi-ments on the NightCity [44] and BDD100K [59] datasets show NightLab achieves SoTA performance compared to concurrent methods.
