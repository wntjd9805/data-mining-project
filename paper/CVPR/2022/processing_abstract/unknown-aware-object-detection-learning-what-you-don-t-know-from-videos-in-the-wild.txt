Building reliable object detectors that can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) objects is critical yet underex-plored. One of the key challenges is that models lack supervision signals from unknown data, producing over-conﬁdent predictions on OOD objects. We propose a new unknown-aware object detection framework throughSpatial-Temporal Unknown Distillation (STUD), which dis-tills unknown objects from videos in the wild and mean-ingfully regularizes the model’s decision boundary. STUDﬁrst identiﬁes the unknown candidate object proposals in the spatial dimension, and then aggregates the candi-dates across multiple video frames to form a diverse set of unknown objects near the decision boundary. Along-side, we employ an energy-based uncertainty regular-ization loss, which contrastively shapes the uncertainty space between the in-distribution and distilled unknown ob-jects. STUD establishes the state-of-the-art performance on OOD detection tasks for object detection, reducing theFPR95 score by over 10% compared to the previous best method.
