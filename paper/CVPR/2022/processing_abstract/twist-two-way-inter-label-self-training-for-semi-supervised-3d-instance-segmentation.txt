We explore the way to alleviate the label-hungry prob-lem in a semi-supervised setting for 3D instance segmenta-tion. To leverage the unlabeled data to boost model perfor-mance, we present a novel Two-Way Inter-label Self-Training framework named TWIST. It exploits inherent correlations between semantic understanding and instance information of a scene. Specifically, we consider two kinds of pseudo labels for semantic- and instance-level supervision. Our key design is to provide object-level information for denois-ing pseudo labels and make use of their correlation for two-way mutual enhancement, thereby iteratively promoting the pseudo-label qualities. TWIST attains leading perfor-mance on both ScanNet and S3DIS, compared to recent 3D pre-training approaches, and can cooperate with them to further enhance performance, e.g., +4.4% AP50 on 1%-label ScanNet data-efficient benchmark.
