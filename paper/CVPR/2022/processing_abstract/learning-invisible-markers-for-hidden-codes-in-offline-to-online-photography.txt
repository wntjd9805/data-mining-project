QR (quick response) codes are widely used as an ofﬂine-to-online channel to convey information (e.g., links) from publicity materials (e.g., display and print) to mobile de-vices. However, QR codes are not favorable for taking up valuable space of publicity materials. Recent works pro-pose invisible codes/hyperlinks that can convey hidden in-formation from ofﬂine to online. However, they require markers to locate invisible codes, which fails the purpose of invisible codes to be visible because of the markers.This paper proposes a novel invisible information hiding ar-chitecture for display/print-camera scenarios, consisting of hiding, locating, correcting, and recovery, where invisible markers are learned to make hidden codes truly invisible.We hide information in a sub-image rather than the entire image and include a localization module in the end-to-end framework. To achieve both high visual quality and high re-covering robustness, an effective multi-stage training strat-egy is proposed. The experimental results show that the pro-posed method outperforms the state-of-the-art informationIn hiding methods in both visual quality and robustness. addition, the automatic localization of hidden codes signif-icantly reduces the time of manually correcting geometric distortions for photos, which is a revolutionary innovation for information hiding in mobile applications.
