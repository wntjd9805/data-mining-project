Tracking and detecting any object, including ones never-seen-before during model training, is a crucial but elusive capability of autonomous systems. An autonomous agent that is blind to never-seen-before objects poses a safety haz-ard when operating in the real world – and yet this is how almost all current systems work. One of the main obstacles towards advancing tracking any object is that this task is no-toriously difﬁcult to evaluate. A benchmark that would al-low us to perform an apples-to-apples comparison of exist-ing efforts is a crucial ﬁrst step towards advancing this im-portant research ﬁeld. This paper addresses this evaluation deﬁcit and lays out the landscape and evaluation method-ology for detecting and tracking both known and unknown objects in the open-world setting. We propose a new bench-mark, TAO-OW: Tracking Any Object in an Open World, analyze existing efforts in multi-object tracking, and con-struct a baseline for this task while highlighting future chal-lenges. We hope to open a new front in multi-object tracking research that will hopefully bring us a step closer to intelli-gent systems that can operate safely in the real world.* These authors contributed equally to this work.
