We study the semi-supervised learning problem, using a few labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train the network, by developing a cross-patch dense con-trastive learning framework, to segment cellular nuclei in histopathologic images. This task is motivated by the ex-pensive burden on collecting labeled data for histopatho-logic image segmentation tasks. The key idea of our method is to align features of teacher and student networks, sam-pled from cross-image in both patch- and pixel-levels, for enforcing the intra-class compactness and inter-class sepa-rability of features that as we shown is helpful for extract-ing valuable knowledge from unlabeled data. We also de-sign a novel optimization framework that combines consis-tency regularization and entropy minimization techniques, showing good property in eviction of gradient vanishing.We assess the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, and obtain positive results on extensive experi-ments, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.
