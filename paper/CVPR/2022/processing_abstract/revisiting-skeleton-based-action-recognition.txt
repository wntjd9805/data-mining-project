Human skeleton, as a compact representation of hu-man action, has received increasing attention in recent years. Many skeleton-based action recognition methods adopt GCNs to extract features on top of human skele-tons. Despite the positive results shown in these attempts,GCN-based methods are subject to limitations in robust-ness, interoperability, and scalability. In this work, we pro-pose PoseConv3D, a new approach to skeleton-based ac-tion recognition. PoseConv3D relies on a 3D heatmap vol-ume instead of a graph sequence as the base representa-tion of human skeletons. Compared to GCN-based methods,PoseConv3D is more effective in learning spatiotemporal features, more robust against pose estimation noises, and generalizes better in cross-dataset settings. Also, PoseC-onv3D can handle multiple-person scenarios without ad-ditional computation costs. The hierarchical features can be easily integrated with other modalities at early fusion stages, providing a great design space to boost the perfor-mance. PoseConv3D achieves the state-of-the-art on five of six standard skeleton-based action recognition bench-marks. Once fused with other modalities, it achieves the state-of-the-art on all eight multi-modality action recog-nition benchmarks.
