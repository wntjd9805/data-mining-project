State-of-the-art stereo matching networks trained only on synthetic data often fail to generalize to more challeng-ing real data domains. In this paper, we attempt to unfold an important factor that hinders the networks from general-izing across domains: through the lens of shortcut learning.We demonstrate that the learning of feature representations in stereo matching networks is heavily influenced by syn-thetic data artefacts (shortcut attributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic Shortcut Avoid-ance (ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related information from being encoded into the feature rep-resentations. As a result, our proposed method learns ro-bust and shortcut-invariant features by minimizing the sen-sitivity of latent features to input variations. To avoid the prohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity op-timization, we propose an effective yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. We show that using this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks that are trained purely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging and previously unseen real data scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method enhances the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the point that they outperform their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging out-of-domain stereo datasets.
