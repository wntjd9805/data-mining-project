3D room layout estimation by a single panorama us-ing deep neural networks has made great progress. How-ever, previous approaches can not obtain efﬁcient geometry awareness of room layout with the only latitude of bound-aries or horizon-depth. We present that using horizon-depth along with room height can obtain omnidirectional-geometry awareness of room layout in both horizontal and vertical directions.In addition, we propose a planar-geometry aware loss function with normals and gradients of normals to supervise the planeness of walls and turn-ing of corners. We propose an efﬁcient network, LGT-Net, for room layout estimation, which contains a novel Trans-former architecture called SWG-Transformer to model ge-ometry relations. SWG-Transformer consists of (Shifted)Window Blocks and Global Blocks to combine the local and global geometry relations. Moreover, we design a novel relative position embedding of Transformer to enhance the spatial identiﬁcation ability for the panorama. Experi-ments show that the proposed LGT-Net achieves better per-formance than current state-of-the-arts (SOTA) on bench-mark datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhigangjiang/LGT-Net.
