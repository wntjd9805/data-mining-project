In the biological visual pathway especially the retina, neurons are tiled along spatial dimensions with the electri-cal coupling as their local association, while in a convolu-tion layer, kernels are placed along the channel dimension singly. We propose convolution of convolution, associat-ing kernels in a layer and letting them collaborate spatially.With this method, a layer can provide feature maps with ex-tra transformations and learn its kernels together instead of isolatedly.It is only used during training, bringing in negligible extra costs; then it can be re-parameterized to common convolution before testing, boosting performance gratuitously in tasks like classiﬁcation, detection and seg-mentation. Our method works even better when larger re-ceptive ﬁelds are demanded. The code is available on site: https://github.com/Genera1Z/ConvolutionOfConvolution.
