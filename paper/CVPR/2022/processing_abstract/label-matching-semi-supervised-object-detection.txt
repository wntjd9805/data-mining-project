Semi-supervised object detection has made significant progress with the development of mean teacher driven self-training. Despite the promising results, the label mismatch problem is not yet fully explored in the previous works, leading to severe confirmation bias during self-training. In this paper, we delve into this problem and propose a sim-ple yet effective LabelMatch framework from two different yet complementary perspectives, i.e., distribution-level and instance-level. For the former one, it is reasonable to ap-proximate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from that of the labeled data according to Monte Carlo Sam-pling. Guided by this weakly supervision cue, we intro-duce a re-distribution mean teacher, which leverages adap-tive label-distribution-aware confidence thresholds to gen-erate unbiased pseudo labels to drive student learning. For the latter one, there exists an overlooked label assignment ambiguity problem across teacher-student models. To rem-edy this issue, we present a novel label assignment mech-anism for self-training framework, namely proposal self-assignment, which injects the proposals from student into teacher and generates accurate pseudo labels to match each proposal in the student model accordingly. Experiments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demon-strate the considerable superiority of our proposed frame-work to other state-of-the-arts.
