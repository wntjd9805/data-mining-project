This paper addresses the problem of single view 3D hu-man reconstruction. Recent implicit function based meth-ods have shown impressive results, but they fail to recover fine face details in their reconstructions. This largely de-grades user experience in applications like 3D telepresence.In this paper, we focus on improving the quality of face in the reconstruction and propose a novel Jointly-alignedImplicit Face Function (JIFF) that combines the merits of the implicit function based approach and model based ap-proach. We employ a 3D morphable face model as our shape prior and compute space-aligned 3D features that capture detailed face geometry information. Such space-aligned 3D features are combined with pixel-aligned 2D features to jointly predict an implicit face function for high quality face reconstruction. We further extend our pipeline and introduce a coarse-to-fine architecture to predict high quality texture for our detailed face model. Extensive evalu-ations have been carried out on public datasets and our pro-posed JIFF has demonstrates superior performance (both quantitatively and qualitatively) over existing state-of-the-arts.
