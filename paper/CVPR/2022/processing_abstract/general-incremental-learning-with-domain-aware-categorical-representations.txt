Continual learning is an important problem for achiev-ing human-level intelligence in real-world applications as an agent must continuously accumulate knowledge in re-sponse to streaming data/tasks. In this work, we consider a general and yet under-explored incremental learning prob-lem in which both the class distribution and class-specific domain distribution change over time.In addition to the typical challenges in class incremental learning, this setting also faces the intra-class stability-plasticity dilemma and intra-class domain imbalance problems. To address above issues, we develop a novel domain-aware continual learn-ing method based on the EM framework. Specifically, we introduce a flexible class representation based on the vonMises-Fisher mixture model to capture the intra-class struc-ture, using an expansion-and-reduction strategy to dynam-ically increase the number of components according to the class complexity. Moreover, we design a bi-level balanced memory to cope with data imbalances within and across classes, which combines with a distillation loss to achieve better inter- and intra-class stability-plasticity trade-off. We conduct exhaustive experiments on three benchmarks: iDig-its, iDomainNet and iCIFAR-20. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms previous methods by a significant margin, demonstrating its superiority.
