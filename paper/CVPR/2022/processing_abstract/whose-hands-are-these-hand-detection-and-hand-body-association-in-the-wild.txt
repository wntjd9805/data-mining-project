We study a new problem of detecting hands and finding the location of the corresponding person for each detected hand. This task is helpful for many downstream tasks such as hand tracking and hand contact estimation. Associating hands with people is challenging in unconstrained condi-tions since multiple people can be present in the scene with varying overlaps and occlusions.We propose a novel end-to-end trainable convolutional network that can jointly detect hands and the body loca-tion for the corresponding person. Our method first de-tects a set of hands and bodies and uses a novel Hand-BodyAssociation Network to predict association scores between them. We use these association scores to find the body lo-cation for each detected hand. We also introduce a new challenging dataset called BodyHands containing uncon-strained images with hand and their corresponding body locations annotations. We conduct extensive experiments on BodyHands and another public dataset to show the ef-fectiveness of our method. Finally, we demonstrate the ben-efits of hand-body association in two critical applications: hand tracking and hand contact estimation. Our experi-ments show that hand tracking and hand contact estima-tion methods can be improved significantly by reasoning about the hand-body association.
