Precise representations of 3D faces are beneﬁcial to var-ious computer vision and graphics applications. Due to the data discretization and model linearity, however, it re-mains challenging to capture accurate identity and expres-sion clues in current studies. This paper presents a novel 3D morphable face model, namely ImFace, to learn a nonlinear and continuous space with implicit neural representations.It builds two explicitly disentangled deformation ﬁelds to model complex shapes associated with identities and ex-pressions, respectively, and designs an improved learning strategy to extend embeddings of expressions to allow more diverse changes. We further introduce a Neural Blend-Field to learn sophisticated details by adaptively blending a se-ries of local ﬁelds. In addition to ImFace, an effective pre-processing pipeline is proposed to address the issue of wa-tertight input requirement in implicit representations, en-abling them to work with common facial surfaces for theﬁrst time. Extensive experiments are performed to demon-strate the superiority of ImFace.
