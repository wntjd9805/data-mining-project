Waste inspection for packaged waste is an important step in the pipeline of waste disposal. Previous methods either rely on manual visual checking or RGB image-based in-spection algorithm, requiring costly preparation procedures (e.g., open the bag and spread the waste items). More-over, occluded items are very likely to be left out. Inspired by the fact that X-ray has a strong penetrating power to see through the bag and overlapping objects, we propose to perform waste inspection efficiently using X-ray images without the need to open the bag. We introduce a novel problem of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray im-age for intelligent waste inspection, and contribute a real dataset consisting of 5,038 X-ray images (totally 30,881 waste items) with high-quality annotations (i.e., waste cate-gories, object boxes, and instance-level masks) as a bench-mark for this problem. As existing segmentation methods are mainly designed for natural images and cannot take ad-vantage of the characteristics of X-ray waste images (e.g., heavy occlusions and penetration effect), we propose a new instance segmentation method to explicitly take these im-age characteristics into account. Specifically, our method adopts an easy-to-hard disassembling strategy to use high confidence predictions to guide the segmentation of highly overlapped objects, and a global structure guidance module to better capture the complex contour information caused by the penetration effect. Extensive experiments demon-strate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our dataset is released at WIXRayNet.
