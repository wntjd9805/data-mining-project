The application of deep neural networks (DNNs) on 360-degree images has achieved remarkable progress in the re-cent years. However, DNNs have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to well-crafted adversarial examples, which may trigger severe safety problems in the real-world ap-plications based on 360-degree images. In this paper, we propose an adversarial attack targeting spherical images, called 360-attactk, that transfers adversarial perturbations from perspective-view (PV) images to a ﬁnal adversarial spherical image. Given a target spherical image, we ﬁrst represent it with a set of planar PV images, and then per-form 2D attacks on them to obtain adversarial PV images.Considering the issue of the projective distortion between spherical and PV images, we propose a distortion-aware attack to reduce the negative impact of distortion on attack.Moreover, to reconstruct the ﬁnal adversarial spherical im-age with high aggressiveness, we calculate the spherical saliency map with a novel spherical spectrum method and next propose a saliency-aware fusion strategy that merges multiple inverse perspective projections for the same po-sition on the spherical image. Extensive experimental re-sults show that 360-attack is effective for disturbing spheri-cal images in the black-box setting. Our attack also proves the presence of adversarial transferability from Z2 to SO(3) groups.
