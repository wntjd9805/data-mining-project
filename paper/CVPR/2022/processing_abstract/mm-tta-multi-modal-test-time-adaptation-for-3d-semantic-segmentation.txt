Test-time adaptation approaches have recently emerged as a practical solution for handling domain shift without access to the source domain data. In this paper, we pro-pose and explore a new multi-modal extension of test-time adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation. We find that, di-rectly applying existing methods usually results in perfor-mance instability at test time, because multi-modal input is not considered jointly. To design a framework that can take full advantage of multi-modality, where each modal-ity provides regularized self-supervisory signals to other modalities, we propose two complementary modules within and across the modalities. First, Intra-modal Pseudo-label Generation (Intra-PG) is introduced to obtain reli-able pseudo labels within each modality by aggregating information from two models that are both pre-trained on source data but updated with target data at different paces.Second, Inter-modal Pseudo-label Refinement (Inter-PR) adaptively selects more reliable pseudo labels from different modalities based on a proposed consistency scheme. Exper-iments demonstrate that our regularized pseudo labels pro-duce stable self-learning signals in numerous multi-modal test-time adaptation scenarios for 3D semantic segmenta-tion.

We propose a Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation (MM-TTA) framework that enables a model to be quickly adapted to multi-modal test data without access to the source domain train-ing data. We introduce two modules: 1) Intra-PG to produce reli-able pseudo labels within each modality via updating two models (batch norm statistics) in different paces, i.e., slow and fast up-dating schemes with a momentum, and 2) Inter-PR to adaptively select pseudo-labels from the two modalities. These two modules seamlessly collaborate with each other and co-produce final cross-modal pseudo labels to help test-time adaptation.
