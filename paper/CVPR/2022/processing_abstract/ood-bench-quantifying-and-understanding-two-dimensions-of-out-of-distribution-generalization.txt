Deep learning has achieved tremendous success with in-dependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. However, the performance of neural networks often degenerates dras-tically when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) data, i.e., when training and test data are sampled from different distributions. While a plethora of algorithms have been proposed for OoD generalization, our understanding of the data used to train and evaluate these algorithms re-mains stagnant.In this work, we Ô¨Årst identify and mea-sure two distinct kinds of distribution shifts that are ubiq-uitous in various datasets. Next, through extensive experi-ments, we compare OoD generalization algorithms across two groups of benchmarks, each dominated by one of the distribution shifts, revealing their strengths on one shift as well as limitations on the other shift. Overall, we position existing datasets and algorithms from different research ar-eas seemingly unconnected into the same coherent picture.It may serve as a foothold that can be resorted to by fu-ture OoD generalization research.
