Human behavior has the nature of indeterminacy, which requires the pedestrian trajectory prediction system to model the multi-modality of future motion states. Unlike ex-isting stochastic trajectory prediction methods which usu-ally use a latent variable to represent multi-modality, we explicitly simulate the process of human motion variation from indeterminate to determinate. In this paper, we present a new framework to formulate the trajectory prediction task as a reverse process of motion indeterminacy diffu-sion (MID), in which we progressively discard indetermi-nacy from all the walkable areas until reaching the desired trajectory. This process is learned with a parameterizedMarkov chain conditioned by the observed trajectories. We can adjust the length of the chain to control the degree of in-determinacy and balance the diversity and determinacy of the predictions. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we encode the history behav-ior information and the social interactions as a state em-bedding and devise a Transformer-based diffusion model to capture the temporal dependencies of trajectories. Exten-sive experiments on the human trajectory prediction bench-marks including the Stanford Drone and ETH/UCY datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
