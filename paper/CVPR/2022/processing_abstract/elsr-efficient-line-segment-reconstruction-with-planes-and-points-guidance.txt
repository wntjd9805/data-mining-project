Three-dimensional (3D) line segments are helpful for scene reconstruction. Most of the existing 3D-line-segment-reconstruction algorithms deal with two views or dozens of small-size images; while in practice there are usually hundreds or thousands of large-size images. In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient line segment reconstruction method called ELSR 1. ELSR exploits scene planes that are com-monly seen in city scenes and sparse 3D points that can be acquired easily from the structure-from-motion (SfM) ap-proach. For two views, ELSR efﬁciently ﬁnds the local scene plane to guide the line matching and exploits sparse 3D points to accelerate and constrain the matching. To recon-struct a 3D line segment with multiple views, ELSR utilizes an efﬁcient abstraction approach that selects representative 3D lines based on their spatial consistence. Our experi-ments demonstrated that ELSR had a higher accuracy and efﬁciency than the existing methods. Moreover, our results showed that ELSR could reconstruct 3D lines efﬁciently for large and complex scenes that contain thousands of large-size images.
