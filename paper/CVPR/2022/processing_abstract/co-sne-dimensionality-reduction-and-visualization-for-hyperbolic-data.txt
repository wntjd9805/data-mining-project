Hyperbolic space can naturally embed hierarchies that often exist in real-world data and semantics. While high-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings lead to better repre-sentations, most hyperbolic models utilize low-dimensional embeddings, due to non-trivial optimization and visualiza-tion of high-dimensional hyperbolic data.We propose CO-SNE, which extends the Euclidean space visualization tool, t-SNE, to hyperbolic space. Like t-SNE, it converts distances between data points to joint probabil-ities and tries to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of high-dimensional data X and low-dimensional embedding Y . However, unlike Eu-clidean space, hyperbolic space is inhomogeneous: A vol-ume could contain a lot more points at a location far from the origin. CO-SNE thus uses hyperbolic normal distribu-tions for X and hyperbolic Cauchy instead of t-SNE’s Stu-dent’s t-distribution for Y , and it additionally seeks to pre-serve X’s individual distances to the Origin in Y .We apply CO-SNE to naturally hyperbolic data and su-pervisedly learned hyperbolic features. Our results demon-strate that CO-SNE deﬂates high-dimensional hyperbolic data into a low-dimensional space without losing their hy-perbolic characteristics, signiﬁcantly outperforming pop-ular visualization tools such as PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, andHoroPCA which is also designed for hyperbolic data.
