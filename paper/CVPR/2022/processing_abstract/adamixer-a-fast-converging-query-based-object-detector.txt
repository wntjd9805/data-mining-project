Traditional object detectors employ the dense paradigm of scanning over locations and scales in an image. The recent query-based object detectors break this convention by decoding image features with a set of learnable queries.However, this paradigm still suffers from slow convergence, limited performance, and design complexity of extra net-works between backbone and decoder.In this paper, we find that the key to these issues is the adaptability of de-coders for casting queries to varying objects. Accordingly, we propose a fast-converging query-based detector, namedAdaMixer, by improving the adaptability of query-based de-coding processes in two aspects. First, each query adap-tively samples features over space and scales based on es-timated offsets, which allows AdaMixer to efficiently attend to the coherent regions of objects. Then, we dynamically decode these sampled features with an adaptive MLP-Mixer under the guidance of each query. Thanks to these two criti-cal designs, AdaMixer enjoys architectural simplicity with-out requiring dense attentional encoders or explicit pyra-mid networks. On the challenging MS COCO benchmark,AdaMixer with ResNet-50 as the backbone, with 12 train-ing epochs, reaches up to 45.0 AP on the validation set along with 27.9 APs in detecting small objects. With the longer training scheme, AdaMixer with ResNeXt-101-DCN and Swin-S reaches 49.5 and 51.3 AP. Our work sheds light on a simple, accurate, and fast converging architecture for query-based object detectors. The code is made available at https://github.com/M CG-NJ U/AdaM ixer.
