Trojan attacks threaten deep neural networks (DNNs) by poisoning them to behave normally on most samples, yet to produce manipulated results for inputs attached with a par-ticular trigger. Several works attempt to detect whether a given DNN has been injected with a specific trigger dur-In a parallel line of research, the lot-ing the training. tery ticket hypothesis reveals the existence of sparse sub-networks which are capable of reaching competitive per-formance as the dense network after independent training.Connecting these two dots, we investigate the problem ofTrojan DNN detection from the brand new lens of spar-sity, even when no clean training data is available. Our crucial observation is that the Trojan features are signif-icantly more stable to network pruning than benign fea-tures. Leveraging that, we propose a novel Trojan network detection regime: first locating a “winning Trojan lottery ticket” which preserves nearly full Trojan information yet only chance-level performance on clean inputs; then re-covering the trigger embedded in this already isolated sub-network. Extensive experiments on various datasets, i.e.,CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, with different net-work architectures, i.e., VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-20s, and DenseNet-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro-posal.
