InputGround TruthBaselineBaseline+ADELEDeep learning in the presence of noisy annotations has been studied extensively in classiﬁcation, but much less in segmentation tasks.In this work, we study the learning dynamics of deep segmentation networks trained on inaccu-rately annotated data. We observe a phenomenon that has been previously reported in the context of classiﬁcation: the networks tend to ﬁrst ﬁt the clean pixel-level labels during an “early-learning” phase, before eventually memorizing the false annotations. However, in contrast to classiﬁcation, memorization in segmentation does not arise simultaneously for all semantic categories. Inspired by these ﬁndings, we propose a new method for segmentation from noisy annota-tions with two key elements. First, we detect the beginning of the memorization phase separately for each category dur-ing training. This allows us to adaptively correct the noisy annotations in order to exploit early learning. Second, we incorporate a regularization term that enforces consistency across scales to boost robustness against annotation noise.Our method outperforms standard approaches on a medical-imaging segmentation task where noises are synthesized to mimic human annotation errors. It also provides robustness to realistic noisy annotations present in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results onPASCAL VOC 2012. 1
