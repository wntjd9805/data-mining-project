Although existing semantic segmentation approaches achieve impressive results, they still struggle to update their models incrementally as new categories are uncov-ered. Furthermore, pixel-by-pixel annotations are expen-sive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel framework for Weakly Incremental Learning for SemanticSegmentation, that aims at learning to segment new classes from cheap and largely available image-level labels. As op-posed to existing approaches, that need to generate pseudo-labels offline, we use a localizer, trained with image-level labels and regularized by the segmentation model, to obtain pseudo-supervision online and update the model incremen-tally. We cope with the inherent noise in the process by us-ing soft-labels generated by the localizer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Pascal VOC andCOCO datasets, outperforming offline weakly-supervised methods and obtaining results comparable with incremental learning methods with full supervision. 1
