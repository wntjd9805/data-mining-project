We present Reversible Vision Transformers, a memory efficient architecture design for visual recognition. By de-coupling the GPU memory footprint from the depth of the model, Reversible Vision Transformers enable memory ef-ficient scaling of transformer architectures. We adapt two popular models, namely Vision Transformer and MultiscaleVision Transformers, to reversible variants and benchmark extensively across both model sizes and tasks of image clas-sification, object detection and video classification. Re-versible Vision Transformers achieve a reduced memory footprint of up to 15.5× at identical model complexity, pa-rameters and accuracy, demonstrating the promise of re-versible vision transformers as an efficient backbone for re-source limited training regimes. Finally, we find that the ad-ditional computational burden of recomputing activations is more than overcome for deeper models, where through-put can increase up to 3.9× over their non-reversible coun-terparts.
