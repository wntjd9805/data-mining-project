We address the problem of generalizability for multi-view 3D human pose estimation. The standard approach is to first detect 2D keypoints in images and then apply triangula-tion from multiple views. Even though the existing methods achieve remarkably accurate 3D pose estimation on pub-lic benchmarks, most of them are limited to a single spa-tial camera arrangement and their number. Several meth-ods address this limitation but demonstrate significantly de-graded performance on novel views. We propose a stochas-tic framework for human pose triangulation and demon-strate a superior generalization across different camera ar-rangements on two public datasets. In addition, we apply the same approach to the fundamental matrix estimation problem, showing that the proposed method can success-fully apply to other computer vision problems. The stochas-tic framework achieves more than 8.8% improvement on the 3D pose estimation task, compared to the state-of-the-art, and more than 30% improvement for fundamental matrix estimation, compared to a standard algorithm.
