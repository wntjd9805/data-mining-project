This paper investigates the geometric consistency for monocular 3D object detection, which suffers from the ill-posed depth estimation. We ﬁrst conduct a thorough anal-ysis to reveal how existing methods fail to consistently lo-calize objects when different geometric shifts occur. In par-ticular, we design a series of geometric manipulations to diagnose existing detectors and then illustrate their vulner-ability to consistently associate the depth with object ap-parent sizes and positions. To alleviate this issue, we pro-pose four geometry-aware data augmentation approaches to enhance the geometric consistency of the detectors. Weﬁrst modify some commonly used data augmentation meth-ods for 2D images so that they can maintain geometric con-sistency in 3D spaces. We demonstrate such modiﬁcations are important. In addition, we propose a 3D-speciﬁc image perturbation method that employs the camera movement.During the augmentation process, the camera system with the corresponding image is manipulated, while the geomet-ric visual cues for depth recovery are preserved. We show that by using the geometric consistency constraints, the pro-posed augmentation techniques lead to improvements on theKITTI and nuScenes monocular 3D detection benchmarksIn addition, we demonstrate with state-of-the-art results. that the augmentation methods are well suited for semi-supervised training and cross-dataset generalization.
