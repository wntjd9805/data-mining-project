Geometric verification is considered a de facto solution for the re-ranking task in image retrieval.In this study, we propose a novel image retrieval re-ranking network named Correlation Verification Networks (CVNet). Our proposed network, comprising deeply stacked 4D convolu-tional layers, gradually compresses dense feature correla-tion into image similarity while learning diverse geomet-ric matching patterns from various image pairs. To en-able cross-scale matching, it builds feature pyramids and constructs cross-scale feature correlations within a single inference, replacing costly multi-scale inferences.In ad-dition, we use curriculum learning with the hard negative mining and Hide-and-Seek strategy to handle hard sam-ples without losing generality. Our proposed re-ranking network shows state-of-the-art performance on several re-trieval benchmarks with a significant margin (+12.6% in mAP on ROxford-Hard+1M set) over state-of-the-art meth-ods.
