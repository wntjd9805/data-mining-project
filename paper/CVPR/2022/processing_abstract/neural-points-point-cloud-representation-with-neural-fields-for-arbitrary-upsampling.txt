In this paper, we propose Neural Points, a novel point cloud representation and apply it to the arbitrary-factored upsampling task. Different from traditional point cloud representation where each point only represents a posi-tion or a local plane in the 3D space, each point in Neu-ral Points represents a local continuous geometric shape via neural fields. Therefore, Neural Points contain more shape information and thus have a stronger representa-tion ability. Neural Points is trained with surface con-taining rich geometric details, such that the trained model has enough expression ability for various shapes. Specifi-cally, we extract deep local features on the points and con-struct neural fields through the local isomorphism between the 2D parametric domain and the 3D local patch. In the final, local neural fields are integrated together to form the global surface. Experimental results show that Neu-ral Points has powerful representation ability and demon-strate excellent robustness and generalization ability. WithNeural Points, we can resample point cloud with arbi-trary resolutions, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud upsampling methods.
