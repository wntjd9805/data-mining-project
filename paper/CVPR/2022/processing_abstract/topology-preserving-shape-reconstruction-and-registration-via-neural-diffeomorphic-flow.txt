Deep Implicit Functions (DIFs) represent 3D geometry with continuous signed distance functions learned through deep neural nets. Recently DIFs-based methods have been proposed to handle shape reconstruction and dense point correspondences simultaneously, capturing semantic relationships across shapes of the same class by learn-ing a DIFs-modeled shape template. These methods pro-vide great ï¬‚exibility and accuracy in reconstructing 3D shapes and inferring correspondences. However, the point correspondences built from these methods do not intrin-sically preserve the topology of the shapes, unlike mesh-based template matching methods. This limits their ap-plications on 3D geometries where underlying topologi-cal structures exist and matter, such as anatomical struc-In this paper, we propose a tures in medical images. new model called Neural Diffeomorphic Flow (NDF) to learn deep implicit shape templates, representing shapes as conditional diffeomorphic deformations of templates, in-trinsically preserving shape topologies. The diffeomor-phic deformation is realized by an auto-decoder consist-ing of Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) blocks that progressively map shapes to implicit tem-plates. We conduct extensive experiments on several medical image organ segmentation datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of NDF on reconstructing and aligning shapes. NDF achieves consistently state-of-the-art organ shape reconstruction and registration results in both ac-curacy and quality.
