Subgraph recognition aims at discovering a compressed substructure of a graph that is most informative to the graph property. It can be formulated by optimizing Graph Infor-mation Bottleneck (GIB) with a mutual information estima-tor. However, GIB suffers from training instability and de-generated results due to its intrinsic optimization process.To tackle these issues, we reformulate the subgraph recog-nition problem into two steps: graph perturbation and sub-graph selection, leading to a novel Variational Graph Infor-mation Bottleneck (VGIB) framework. VGIB first employs the noise injection to modulate the information flow from the input graph to the perturbed graph. Then, the perturbed graph is encouraged to be informative to the graph prop-erty. VGIB further obtains the desired subgraph by filtering out the noise in the perturbed graph. With the customized noise prior for each input, the VGIB objective is endowed with a tractable variational upper bound, leading to a su-perior empirical performance as well as theoretical prop-erties. Extensive experiments on graph interpretation, ex-plainability of Graph Neural Networks, and graph classifi-cation show that VGIB finds better subgraphs than existing methods 1.
