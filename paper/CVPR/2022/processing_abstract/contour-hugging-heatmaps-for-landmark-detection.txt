We propose an effective and easy-to-implement method for simultaneously performing landmark detection in im-ages and obtaining an ingenious uncertainty measurement for each landmark. Uncertainty measurements for land-marks are particularly useful in medical imaging applica-tions: rather than giving an erroneous reading, a landmark detection system is more useful when it flags its level of confidence in its prediction. When an automated system is unsure of its predictions, the accuracy of the results can be further improved manually by a human.In the medi-cal domain, being able to review an automated system’s level of certainty significantly improves a clinician’s trust in it. This paper obtains landmark predictions with un-certainty measurements using a three stage method: 1) We train our network on one-hot heatmap images, 2) We cali-brate the uncertainty of the network using temperature scal-ing, 3) We calculate a novel statistic called ‘Expected Ra-dial Error’ to obtain uncertainty measurements. We find that this method not only achieves localization results on par with other state-of-the-art methods but also an uncer-tainty score which correlates with the true error for each landmark thereby bringing an overall step change in what a generic computer vision method for landmark detection should be capable of. In addition we show that our uncer-tainty measurement can be used to classify, with good accu-racy, what landmark predictions are likely to be inaccurate.Code available at: https://github.com/jfm15/ContourHuggingHeatmaps.git
