Removing adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow from images is an important problem in many appli-cations. Most methods proposed in the literature have been designed to deal with just removing one type of degrada-tion. Recently, a CNN-based method using neural archi-tecture search (All-in-One) was proposed to remove all the weather conditions at once. However, it has a large num-ber of parameters as it uses multiple encoders to cater to each weather removal task and still has scope for improve-ment in its performance. In this work, we focus on devel-oping an efﬁcient solution for the all adverse weather re-moval problem. To this end, we propose TransWeather, a transformer-based end-to-end model with just a single en-coder and a decoder that can restore an image degraded by any weather condition. Speciﬁcally, we utilize a novel transformer encoder using intra-patch transformer blocks to enhance attention inside the patches to effectively re-move smaller weather degradations. We also introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather type embed-dings to adjust to the weather degradation at hand. Tran-sWeather achieves signiﬁcant improvements across multi-ple test datasets over both All-in-One network as well as methods ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. TransWeather is also validated on real world test images and found to be more effective than previous methods. Implementation code can be found in the supplementary document.
