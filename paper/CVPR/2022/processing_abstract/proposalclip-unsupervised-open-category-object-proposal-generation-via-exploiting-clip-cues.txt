Unlike previous works which require a large number of bounding box annota-tions and/or can only generate proposals for limited ob-ject categories, our ProposalCLIP is able to predict pro-posals for a large variety of object categories without an-notations, by exploiting CLIP (contrastive language-image pre-training) cues. Firstly, we analyze CLIP for unsuper-vised open-category proposal generation and design an ob-jectness score based on our empirical analysis on proposal selection. Secondly, a graph-based merging module is pro-posed to solve the limitations of CLIP cues and merge frag-mented proposals. Finally, we present a proposal regres-sion module that extracts pseudo labels based on CLIP cues and trains a lightweight network to further refine proposals.Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO and Vi-sual Genome datasets show that our ProposalCLIP can bet-ter generate proposals than previous state-of-the-art meth-ods. Our ProposalCLIP also shows benefits for downstream tasks, such as unsupervised object detection.
