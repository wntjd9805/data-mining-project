Normal FrameAnomalous FrameA Anomalous VideoUnlabeled Video............Video anomaly detection is well investigated in weakly-supervised and one-class classiﬁcation (OCC) settings.However, unsupervised video anomaly detection methods are quite sparse, likely because anomalies are less frequent in occurrence and usually not well-deﬁned, which when coupled with the absence of ground truth supervision, could adversely affect the performance of the learning algorithms.This problem is challenging yet rewarding as it can com-pletely eradicate the costs of obtaining laborious annota-tions and enable such systems to be deployed without hu-man intervention. To this end, we propose a novel unsuper-vised Generative Cooperative Learning (GCL) approach for video anomaly detection that exploits the low frequency of anomalies towards building a cross-supervision between a generator and a discriminator. In essence, both networks get trained in a cooperative fashion, thereby allowing unsu-pervised learning. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale video anomaly detection datasets, UCF crime and ShanghaiTech. Consistent improvement over the exist-ing state-of-the-art unsupervised and OCC methods corrob-orate the effectiveness of our approach.
