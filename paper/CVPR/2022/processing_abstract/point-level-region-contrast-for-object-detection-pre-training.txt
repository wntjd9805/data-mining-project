In this work we present point-level region contrast, a self-supervised pre-training approach for the task of object detection. This approach is motivated by the two key fac-tors in detection: localization and recognition. While accu-rate localization favors models that operate at the pixel- or point-level, correct recognition typically relies on a more holistic, region-level view of objects.Incorporating this perspective in pre-training, our approach performs con-trastive learning by directly sampling individual point pairs from different regions. Compared to an aggregated repre-sentation per region, our approach is more robust to the change in input region quality, and further enables us to im-plicitly improve initial region assignments via online knowl-edge distillation during training. Both advantages are im-portant when dealing with imperfect regions encountered in the unsupervised setting. Experiments show point-level region contrast improves on state-of-the-art pre-training methods for object detection and segmentation across mul-tiple tasks and datasets, and we provide extensive ablation studies and visualizations to aid understanding. Code will be made available.
