Scene text detection and document layout analysis have long been treated as two separate tasks in different im-age domains.In this paper, we bring them together and introduce the task of uniﬁed scene text detection and lay-out analysis. The ﬁrst hierarchical scene text dataset is introduced to enable this novel research task. We also propose a novel method that is able to simultaneously de-tect scene text and form text clusters in a uniﬁed way.Comprehensive experiments show that our uniﬁed model achieves better performance than multiple well-designed baseline methods. Additionally, this model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple scene text detection datasets without the need of complex post-processing.
