Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are known to make over-conﬁdent mistakes, which makes their use problematic in safety-critical applications. State-of-the-art (SOTA) calibra-tion techniques improve on the conﬁdence of predicted labels alone, and leave the conﬁdence of non-max classes (e.g. top-2, top-5) uncalibrated. Such calibration is not suitable for§Equal contribution label reﬁnement using post-processing. Further, most SOTA techniques learn a few hyper-parameters post-hoc, leaving out the scope for image, or pixel speciﬁc calibration. This makes them unsuitable for calibration under domain shift, or for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. In this paper, we argue for intervening at the train time itself, so as to directly produce calibrated DNN models. We pro-pose a novel auxiliary loss function: Multi-class Difference in Conﬁdence and Accuracy (MDCA), to achieve the same.      MDCA can be used in conjunction with other application/task speciﬁc loss functions. We show that training with MDCA leads to better calibrated models in terms of Expected Cal-ibration Error (ECE), and Static Calibration Error (SCE) on image classiﬁcation, and segmentation tasks. We reportECE (SCE) score of 0.72 (1.60) on the CIFAR 100 dataset, in comparison to 1.90 (1.71) by the SOTA. Under domain shift, a ResNet-18 model trained on PACS dataset using MDCA gives a average ECE (SCE) score of 19.7 (9.7) across all domains, compared to 24.2 (11.8) by the SOTA. For segmen-tation task, we report a 2× reduction in calibration error on PASCAL-VOC dataset in comparison to Focal Loss [32].Finally, MDCA training improves calibration even on imbal-anced data, and for natural language classiﬁcation tasks.
