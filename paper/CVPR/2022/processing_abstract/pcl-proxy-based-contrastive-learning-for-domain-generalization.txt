Domain generalization refers to the problem of training a model from a collection of different source domains that can directly generalize to the unseen target domains. A promising solution is contrastive learning, which attempts to learn domain-invariant representations by exploiting rich semantic relations among sample-to-sample pairs from dif-ferent domains. A simple approach is to pull positive sam-ple pairs from different domains closer while pushing other negative pairs further apart.In this paper, we ﬁnd that directly applying contrastive-based methods (e.g., super-vised contrastive learning) are not effective in domain gen-eralization. We argue that aligning positive sample-to-sample pairs tends to hinder the model generalization due to the signiﬁcant distribution gaps between different do-mains. To address this issue, we propose a novel proxy-based contrastive learning method, which replaces the orig-inal sample-to-sample relations with proxy-to-sample rela-tions, signiﬁcantly alleviating the positive alignment issue.Experiments on the four standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we also consider a more complex scenario where no ImageNet pre-trained models are provided. Our method consistently shows better performance.
