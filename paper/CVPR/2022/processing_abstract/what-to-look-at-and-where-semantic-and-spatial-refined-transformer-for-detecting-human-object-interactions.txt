We propose a novel one-stage Transformer-based se-mantic and spatial refined transformer (SSRT) to solve theHuman-Object Interaction detection task, which requires to localize humans and objects, and predicts their interac-tions. Differently from previous Transformer-based HOI ap-proaches, which mostly focus at improving the design of the decoder outputs for the final detection, SSRT introduces two new modules to help select the most relevant object-action pairs within an image and refine the queriesâ€™ representation using rich semantic and spatial features. These enhance-ments lead to state-of-the-art results on the two most popu-lar HOI benchmarks: V-COCO and HICO-DET.
