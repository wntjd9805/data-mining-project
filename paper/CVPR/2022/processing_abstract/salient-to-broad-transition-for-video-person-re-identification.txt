Due to the limited utilization of temporal relations in video re-id, the frame-level attention regions of mainstream methods are partial and highly similar. To address this problem, we propose a Salient-to-Broad Module (SBM) to enlarge the attention regions gradually. Speciﬁcally, in SBM, while the previous frames have focused on the the later frames tend to focus on most salient regions, broader regions.In this way, the additional information in broad regions can supplement salient regions, incurring more powerful video-level representations. To further im-prove SBM, an Integration-and-Distribution Module (IDM) is introduced to enhance frame-level representations. IDMﬁrst integrates features from the entire feature space and then distributes the integrated features to each spatial lo-cation. SBM and IDM are mutually beneﬁcial since they enhance the representations from video-level and frame-level, respectively. Extensive experiments on four preva-lent benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and supe-riority of our method. The source code is available at https://github.com/baist/SINet.
