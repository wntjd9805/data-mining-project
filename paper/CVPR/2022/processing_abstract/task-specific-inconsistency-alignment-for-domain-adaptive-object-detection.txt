Detectors trained with massive labeled data often exhibit dramatic performance degradation in some particular sce-narios with data distribution gap. To alleviate this problem of domain shift, conventional wisdom typically concentrates solely on reducing the discrepancy between the source and target domains via attached domain classifiers, yet ignoring the difficulty of such transferable features in coping with both classification and localization subtasks in object de-tection. To address this issue, in this paper, we proposeTask-specific Inconsistency Alignment (TIA), by develop-ing a new alignment mechanism in separate task spaces, improving the performance of the detector on both sub-tasks. Specifically, we add a set of auxiliary predictors for both classification and localization branches, and exploit their behavioral inconsistencies as finer-grained domain-specific measures. Then, we devise task-specific losses to align such cross-domain disagreement of both subtasks. By optimizing them individually, we are able to well approx-imate the category- and boundary-wise discrepancies in each task space, and therefore narrow them in a decou-pled manner. TIA demonstrates superior results on vari-ous scenarios to the previous state-of-the-art methods. It is also observed that both the classification and localiza-tion capabilities of the detector are sufficiently strength-ened, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our TIA method.
