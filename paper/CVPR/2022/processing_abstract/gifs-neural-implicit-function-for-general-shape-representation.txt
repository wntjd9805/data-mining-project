implicitRecent development of neural function has shown tremendous success on high-quality 3D shape re-construction. However, most works divide the space into inside and outside of the shape, which limits their repre-senting power to single-layer and watertight shapes. This limitation leads to tedious data processing (converting non-watertight raw data to watertight) as well as the inca-pability of representing general object shapes in the realIn this work, we propose a novel method to rep-world. resent general shapes including non-watertight shapes and shapes with multi-layer surfaces. We introduce General Im-plicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS), which models the re-lationships between every two points instead of the relation-ships between points and surfaces. Instead of dividing 3D space into predefined inside-outside regions, GIFS encodes whether two points are separated by any surface. Experi-ments on ShapeNet show that GIFS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction qual-ity, rendering efficiency, and visual fidelity.
