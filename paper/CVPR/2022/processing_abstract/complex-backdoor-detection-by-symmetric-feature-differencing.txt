Many existing backdoor scanners work by finding a small and fixed trigger. However, advanced attacks have large and pervasive triggers, rendering existing scannersIt less effective. We develop a new detection method. first uses a trigger inversion technique to generate triggers, namely, universal input patterns flipping victim class sam-ples to a target class. It then checks if any such trigger is composed of features that are not natural distinctive fea-tures between the victim and target classes. It is based on a novel symmetric feature differencing method that identi-fies features separating two sets of samples (e.g., from two respective classes). We evaluate the technique on a number of advanced attacks including composite attack, reflection attack, hidden attack, filter attack, and also on the tradi-tional patch attack. The evaluation is on thousands of mod-els, including both clean and trojaned models, with various architectures. We compare with three state-of-the-art scan-ners. Our technique can achieve 80-88% accuracy while the baselines can only achieve 50-70% on complex attacks.Our results on the TrojAI competition rounds 2-4, which have patch backdoors and filter backdoors, show that exist-ing scanners may produce hundreds of false positives (i.e., clean models recognized as trojaned), while our technique removes 78-100% of them with a small increase of false negatives by 0-30%, leading to 17-41% overall accuracy improvement. This allows us to achieve top performance on the leaderboard.
