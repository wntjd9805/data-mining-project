We consider the object recognition problem in au-tonomous driving using automotive radar sensors. Com-paring to Lidar sensors, radar is cost-effective and robust in all-weather conditions for perception in autonomous driving.However, radar signals suffer from low angular resolution and precision in recognizing surrounding objects. To en-hance the capacity of automotive radar, in this work, we exploit the temporal information from successive ego-centric bird-eye-view radar image frames for radar object recogni-tion. We leverage the consistency of an objectâ€™s existence and attributes (size, orientation, etc.), and propose a tempo-ral relational layer to explicitly model the relations between objects within successive radar images. In both object detec-tion and multiple object tracking, we show the superiority of our method compared to several baseline approaches.
