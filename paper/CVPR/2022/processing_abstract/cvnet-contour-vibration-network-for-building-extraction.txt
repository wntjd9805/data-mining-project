The classic active contour model raises a great promis-ing solution to polygon-based object extraction with the progress of deep learning recently. Inspired by the physical vibration theory, we propose a contour vibration network (CVNet) for automatic building boundary delineation. Dif-ferent from the previous contour models, the CVNet orig-inally roots in the force and motion principle of contour string. Through the inﬁnitesimal analysis and Newton’s second law, we derive the spatial-temporal contour vibra-tion model of object shapes, which is mathematically re-duced to second-order differential equation. To concretize the dynamic model, we transform the vibration model into the space of image features, and reparameterize the equa-tion coefﬁcients as the learnable state from feature domain.The contour changes are ﬁnally evolved in a progressive mode through the computation of contour vibration equa-tion. Both the polygon contour evolution and the model optimization are modulated to form a close-looping end-to-end network. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our CVNet over other baselines and state-of-the-art methods for the polygon-based building extraction.
