Nowadays, cameras equipped with AI systems can cap-ture and analyze images to detect people automatically.However, the AI system can make mistakes when receiving deliberately designed patterns in the real world, i.e., phys-ical adversarial examples. Prior works have shown that it is possible to print adversarial patches on clothes to evadeDNN-based person detectors. However, these adversarial examples could have catastrophic drops in the attack suc-cess rate when the viewing angle (i.e., the cameraâ€™s an-gle towards the object) changes. To perform a multi-angle attack, we propose Adversarial Texture (AdvTexture). Ad-vTexture can cover clothes with arbitrary shapes so that people wearing such clothes can hide from person detec-tors from different viewing angles. We propose a generative method, named Toroidal-Cropping-based Expandable Gen-erative Attack (TC-EGA), to craft AdvTexture with repetitive structures. We printed several pieces of cloth with AdvTex-ure and then made T-shirts, skirts, and dresses in the physi-cal world. Experiments showed that these clothes could fool person detectors in the physical world.
