Hyperspectral imaging is an essential imaging modal-ity for a wide range of applications, especially in remote sensing, agriculture, and medicine.Inspired by existing hyperspectral cameras that are either slow, expensive, or bulky, reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from a low-budget snapshot measurement has drawn wide atten-tion. By mapping a truncated numerical optimization al-gorithm into a network with a ﬁxed number of phases, re-cent deep unfolding networks (DUNs) for spectral snapshot compressive sensing (SCI) have achieved remarkable suc-cess. However, DUNs are far from reaching the scope of industrial applications limited by the lack of cross-phase feature interaction and adaptive parameter adjustment. In this paper, we propose a novel Hyperspectral ExplicableReconstruction and Optimal Sampling deep Network forSCI, dubbed HerosNet, which includes several phases un-der the ISTA-unfolding framework. Each phase can ﬂexibly simulate the sensing matrix and contextually adjust the step size in the gradient descent step, and hierarchically fuse and interact the hidden states of previous phases to effec-tively recover current HSI frames in the proximal mapping step. Simultaneously, a hardware-friendly optimal binary mask is learned end-to-end to further improve the recon-struction performance. Finally, our HerosNet is validated to outperform the state-of-the-art methods on both simula-tion and real datasets by large margins.
