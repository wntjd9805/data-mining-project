A model that can authentically restore a low-quality face image to a high-quality one can beneﬁt many applications.While existing approaches for face restoration make sig-niﬁcant progress in generating high-quality faces, they of-ten fail to preserve facial features that compromise the au-thenticity of reconstructed faces. Because the human vi-sual system is very sensitive to faces, even minor changes may signiﬁcantly degrade the perceptual quality.In this work, we argue that the problems of existing models can be traced down to the two sub-tasks of the face restoration problem, i.e. face generation and face reconstruction, and the fragile balance between them. Based on the observa-tion, we propose a new face restoration model that improves both generation and reconstruction. Besides the model improvement, we also introduce a new evaluation metric for measuring models’ ability to preserve the identity in the restored faces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multi-ple face restoration benchmarks, and the proposed metric has a higher correlation with user preference. The user study shows that our model produces higher quality faces while better preserving the identity 86.4% of the time com-pared with state-of-the-art methods.
