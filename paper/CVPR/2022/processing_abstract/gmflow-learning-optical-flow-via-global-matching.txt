Learning-based optical flow estimation has been domi-nated with the pipeline of cost volume with convolutions for flow regression, which is inherently limited to local corre-lations and thus is hard to address the long-standing chal-lenge of large displacements. To alleviate this, the state-of-the-art framework RAFT gradually improves its predic-tion quality by using a large number of iterative refinements, achieving remarkable performance but introducing linearly increasing inference time. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, we completely revamp the dominant flow re-gression pipeline by reformulating optical flow as a global matching problem, which identifies the correspondences by directly comparing feature similarities. Specifically, we propose a GMFlow framework, which consists of three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature matching, and a self-attention layer for flow propa-gation. We further introduce a refinement step that reusesGMFlow at higher feature resolution for residual flow pre-diction. Our new framework outperforms 31-refinementsRAFT on the challenging Sintel benchmark, while using only one refinement and running faster, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.Code is available at https://github.com/haofeixu/gmflow.
