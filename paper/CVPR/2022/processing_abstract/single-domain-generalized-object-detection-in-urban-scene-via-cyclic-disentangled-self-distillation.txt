In this paper, we are concerned with enhancing the gen-eralization capability of object detectors. And we consider a realistic yet challenging scenario, namely Single-DomainGeneralized Object Detection (Single-DGOD), which aims to learn an object detector that performs well on many unseen target domains with only one source domain for training. Towards Single-DGOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant representations (DIR) containing intrin-sical object characteristics, which is beneﬁcial for improv-ing the robustness for unseen domains. Thus, we present a method, i.e., cyclic-disentangled self-distillation, to dis-entangle DIR from domain-speciﬁc representations without the supervision of domain-related annotations (e.g., domain labels). Concretely, a cyclic-disentangled module is ﬁrst proposed to cyclically extract DIR from the input visual fea-tures. Through the cyclic operation, the disentangled ability can be promoted without the reliance on domain-related an-notations. Then, taking the DIR as the teacher, we design a self-distillation module to further enhance the generaliza-tion ability. In the experiments, our method is evaluated in urban-scene object detection. Experimental results of ﬁve weather conditions show that our method obtains a signiﬁ-cant performance gain over baseline methods. Particularly, for the night-sunny scene, our method outperforms base-lines by 3%, which indicates that our method is instrumen-tal in enhancing generalization ability.
