Estimating the articulated 3D hand-object pose from a single RGB image is a highly ambiguous and challeng-ing problem, requiring large-scale datasets that contain diverse hand poses, object types, and camera viewpoints.Most real-world datasets lack these diversities.In con-trast, data synthesis can easily ensure those diversities separately. However, constructing both valid and diverse hand-object interactions and efficiently learning from the vast synthetic data is still challenging. To address the above issues, we propose ArtiBoost, a lightweight online data enhancement method. ArtiBoost can cover diverse hand-object poses and camera viewpoints through sam-pling in a Composited hand-object Configuration and View-point space (CCV-space) and can adaptively enrich the current hard-discernable items by loss-feedback and sam-ple re-weighting. ArtiBoost alternatively performs data exploration and synthesis within a learning pipeline, and those synthetic data are blended into real-world source data for training. We apply ArtiBoost on a simple learn-ing baseline network and witness the performance boost on several hand-object benchmarks.
