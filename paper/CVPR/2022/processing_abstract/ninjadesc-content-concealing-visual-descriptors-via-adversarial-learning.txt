In the light of recent analyses on privacy-concerning scene revelation from visual descriptors, we develop de-scriptors that conceal the input image content. In partic-ular, we propose an adversarial learning framework for training visual descriptors that prevent image reconstruc-tion, while maintaining the matching accuracy. We let a fea-ture encoding network and image reconstruction network compete with each other, such that the feature encoder tries to impede the image reconstruction with its generated de-scriptors, while the reconstructor tries to recover the in-put image from the descriptors. The experimental results demonstrate that the visual descriptors obtained with our method signiÔ¨Åcantly deteriorate the image reconstruction quality with minimal impact on correspondence matching and camera localization performance.
