Curating a large set of fully annotated training data can be costly, especially for the tasks of medical image seg-mentation. Scribble, a weaker form of annotation, is more obtainable in practice, but training segmentation models from limited supervision of scribbles is still challenging.To address the difﬁculties, we propose a new framework for scribble learning-based medical image segmentation, which is composed of mix augmentation and cycle con-sistency and thus is referred to as CycleMix. For aug-mentation of supervision, CycleMix adopts the mixup strat-egy with a dedicated design of random occlusion, to per-form increments and decrements of scribbles. For regu-larization of supervision, CycleMix intensiﬁes the train-ing objective with consistency losses to penalize incon-sistent segmentation, which results in signiﬁcant improve-ment of segmentation performance. Results on two open datasets, i.e., ACDC and MSCMRseg, showed that the pro-posed method achieved exhilarating performance, demon-strating comparable or even better accuracy than the fully-supervised methods. The code and expert-made scribble an-notations for MSCMRseg are publicly available at https://github.com/BWGZK/CycleMix.
