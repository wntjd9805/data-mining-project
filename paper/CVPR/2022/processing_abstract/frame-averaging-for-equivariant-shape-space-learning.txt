The task of shape space learning involves mapping a train set of shapes to and from a latent representation space with good generalization properties. Often, real-world col-lections of shapes have symmetries, which can be defined as transformations that do not change the essence of the shape. A natural way to incorporate symmetries in shape space learning is to ask that the mapping to the shape space (encoder) and mapping from the shape space (decoder) are equivariant to the relevant symmetries. In this paper, we present a framework for incorporating equivariance in en-coders and decoders by introducing two contributions: (i) adapting the recent Frame Averaging (FA) framework for building generic, efficient, and maximally expressive Equiv-ariant autoencoders; and (ii) constructing autoencoders equivariant to piecewise Euclidean motions applied to dif-ferent parts of the shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully piecewise Euclidean equivariant au-toencoder construction. Training our framework is simple: it uses standard reconstruction losses, and does not require the introduction of new losses. Our architectures are built of standard (backbone) architectures with the appropriate frame averaging to make them equivariant. Testing our framework on both rigid shapes dataset using implicit neu-ral representations, and articulated shape datasets using mesh-based neural networks show state of the art general-ization to unseen test shapes, improving relevant baselines by a large margin. In particular, our method demonstrates significant improvement in generalizing to unseen articu-lated poses.
