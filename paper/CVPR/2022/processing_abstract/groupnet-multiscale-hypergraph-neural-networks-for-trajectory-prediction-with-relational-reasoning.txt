Demystifying the interactions among multiple agents from their past trajectories is fundamental to precise and inter-pretable trajectory prediction. However, previous works only consider pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction mod-eling for relational reasoning, we propose GroupNet, a mul-tiscale hypergraph neural network, which is novel in terms of both interaction capturing and representation learning.From the aspect of interaction capturing, we propose a train-able multiscale hypergraph to capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions at multiple group sizes. From the aspect of interaction representation learning, we propose a three-element format that can be learnt end-to-end and explicitly reason some relational factors including the inter-action strength and category. We apply GroupNet into bothCVAE-based prediction system and previous state-of-the-art prediction systems for predicting socially plausible trajec-tories with relational reasoning. To validate the ability of relational reasoning, we experiment with synthetic physics simulations to reflect the ability to capture group behaviors, reason interaction strength and interaction category. To validate the effectiveness of prediction, we conduct exten-sive experiments on three real-world trajectory prediction datasets, including NBA, SDD and ETH-UCY; and we show that with GroupNet, the CVAE-based prediction system out-performs state-of-the-art methods. We also show that addingGroupNet will further improve the performance of previous state-of-the-art prediction systems.
