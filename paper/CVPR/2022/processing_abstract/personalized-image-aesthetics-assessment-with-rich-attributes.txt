Personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA) is challenging due to its highly subjective nature. People’s aesthetic tastes depend on diversiﬁed factors, including im-age characteristics and subject characters. The existingPIAA databases are limited in terms of annotation diver-sity, especially the subject aspect, which can no longer meet the increasing demands of PIAA research. To solve the dilemma, we conduct so far, the most comprehensive sub-jective study of personalized image aesthetics and introduce a new Personalized image Aesthetics database with Rich At-tributes (PARA), which consists of 31,220 images with an-notations by 438 subjects. PARA features wealthy annota-tions, including 9 image-oriented objective attributes and 4 human-oriented subjective attributes. In addition, desensi-tized subject information, such as personality traits, is also provided to support study of PIAA and user portraits. A comprehensive analysis of the annotation data is provided and statistic study indicates that the aesthetic preferences can be mirrored by proposed subjective attributes. We also propose a conditional PIAA model by utilizing subject in-formation as conditional prior. Experimental results indi-cate that the conditional PIAA model can outperform the control group, which is also the ﬁrst attempt to demonstrate how image aesthetics and subject characters interact to pro-duce the intricate personalized tastes on image aesthetics.We believe the database and the associated analysis would be useful for conducting next-generation PIAA study.
