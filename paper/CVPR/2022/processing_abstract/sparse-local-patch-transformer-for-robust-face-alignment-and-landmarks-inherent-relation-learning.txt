Heatmap regression methods have dominated face align-ment area in recent years while they ignore the inherent re-lation between different landmarks. In this paper, we pro-pose a Sparse Local Patch Transformer (SLPT) for learn-ing the inherent relation. The SLPT generates the repre-sentation of each single landmark from a local patch and aggregates them by an adaptive inherent relation based on the attention mechanism. The subpixel coordinate of each landmark is predicted independently based on the aggre-gated feature. Moreover, a coarse-to-fine framework is fur-ther introduced to incorporate with the SLPT, which enables the initial landmarks to gradually converge to the target facial landmarks using fine-grained features from dynam-ically resized local patches. Extensive experiments carried out on three popular benchmarks, including WFLW, 300W and COFW, demonstrate that the proposed method works at the state-of-the-art level with much less computational complexity by learning the inherent relation between facial landmarks.
