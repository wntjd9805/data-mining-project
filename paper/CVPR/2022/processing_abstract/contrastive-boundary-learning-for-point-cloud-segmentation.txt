Point cloud segmentation is fundamental in understand-ing 3D environments. However, current 3D point cloud segmentation methods usually perform poorly on scene boundaries, which degenerates the overall segmentation performance. In this paper, we focus on the segmentation of scene boundaries. Accordingly, we ﬁrst explore met-rics to evaluate the segmentation performance on scene boundaries. To address the unsatisfactory performance on boundaries, we then propose a novel contrastive bound-ary learning (CBL) framework for point cloud segmenta-tion. Speciﬁcally, the proposed CBL enhances feature dis-crimination between points across boundaries by contrast-ing their representations with the assistance of scene con-texts at multiple scales. By applying CBL on three differ-ent baseline methods, we experimentally show that CBL consistently improves different baselines and assists them to achieve compelling performance on boundaries, as well as the overall performance, e.g. in mIoU. The experimen-tal results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the importance of boundaries for 3D point cloud segmen-tation.
