Recently, significant progress has been made on image denoising with strong supervision from large-scale datasets.However, obtaining well-aligned noisy-clean training im-age pairs for each specific scenario is complicated and costly in practice. Consequently, applying a conventional supervised denoising network on in-the-wild noisy inputs is not straightforward. Although several studies have chal-lenged this problem without strong supervision, they rely on less practical assumptions and cannot be applied to practi-cal situations directly. To address the aforementioned chal-lenges, we propose a novel and powerful self-supervised de-noising method called CVF-SID based on a Cyclic multi-Variate Function (CVF) module and a self-supervised im-age disentangling (SID) framework. The CVF module can output multiple decomposed variables of the input and take a combination of the outputs back as an input in a cyclic manner. Our CVF-SID can disentangle a clean image and noise maps from the input by leveraging various self-supervised loss terms. Unlike several methods that only consider the signal-independent noise models, we also deal with signal-dependent noise components for real-world ap-plications. Furthermore, we do not rely on any prior as-sumptions about the underlying noise distribution, makingCVF-SID more generalizable toward realistic noise. Ex-tensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CVF-SID achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised image denois-ing performance and is comparable to other existing ap-proaches. The code is publicly available from this link.
