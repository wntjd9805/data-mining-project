Images captured with improper exposures usually bring unsatisfactory visual effects. Previous works mainly focus on either underexposure or overexposure correction, result-ing in poor generalization to various exposures. An alterna-tive solution is to mix the multiple exposure data for train-ing a single network. However, the procedures of correcting underexposure and overexposure to normal exposures are much different from each other, leading to large discrep-ancies for the network in correcting multiple-exposures, thus resulting in poor performance. The key point to ad-dress this issue lies in bridging different exposure repre-sentations. To achieve this goal, we design a multiple ex-posure correction framework based on an Exposure Nor-malization and Compensation (ENC) module. Speciﬁcally, the ENC module consists of an exposure normalization part for mapping different exposure features to the exposure-invariant feature space, and a compensation part for in-tegrating the initial features unprocessed by the exposure normalization part to ensure the completeness of informa-tion. Besides, to further alleviate the imbalanced perfor-mance caused by variations in the optimization process, we introduce a parameter regularization ﬁne-tuning strategy to improve the performance of the worst-performed exposure without degrading other exposures. Our model empowered by ENC outperforms the existing methods by more than 2dB and is robust to multiple image enhancement tasks, demon-strating its effectiveness and generalization capability for real-world applications.
