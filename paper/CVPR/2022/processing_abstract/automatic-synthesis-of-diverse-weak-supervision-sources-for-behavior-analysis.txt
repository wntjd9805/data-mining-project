Obtaining annotations for large training sets is expen-sive, especially in settings where domain knowledge is re-quired, such as behavior analysis. Weak supervision has been studied to reduce annotation costs by using weak la-bels from task-specific labeling functions (LFs) to augment ground truth labels. However, domain experts still need to hand-craft different LFs for different tasks, limiting scal-ability. To reduce expert effort, we present AutoSWAP: a framework for automatically synthesizing data-efficient task-level LFs. The key to our approach is to efficiently represent expert knowledge in a reusable domain-specific language and more general domain-level LFs, with which we use state-of-the-art program synthesis techniques and a small labeled dataset to generate task-level LFs. Addition-ally, we propose a novel structural diversity cost that allows for efficient synthesis of diverse sets of LFs, further improv-ing AutoSWAPâ€™s performance. We evaluate AutoSWAP in three behavior analysis domains and demonstrate that Au-toSWAP outperforms existing approaches using only a frac-tion of the data. Our results suggest that AutoSWAP is an effective way to automatically generate LFs that can signif-icantly reduce expert effort for behavior analysis.
