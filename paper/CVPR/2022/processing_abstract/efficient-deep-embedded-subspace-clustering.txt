Recently deep learning methods have shown signiﬁcant progress in data clustering tasks. Deep clustering method-s (including distance-based methods and subspace-based methods) integrate clustering and feature learning into a uniﬁed framework, where there is a mutual promotion be-tween clustering and representation. However, deep sub-space clustering methods are usually in the framework of self-expressive model and hence have quadratic time and space complexities, which prevents their applications in large-scale clustering and real-time clustering. In this pa-per, we propose a new mechanism for deep clustering. We aim to learn the subspace bases from deep representation in an iterative reﬁning manner while the reﬁned subspace bases help learning the representation of the deep neural networks in return. The proposed method is out of the self-expressive framework, scales to the sample size linearly, and is applicable to arbitrarily large datasets and online clustering scenarios. More importantly, the clustering ac-curacy of the proposed method is much higher than its com-petitors. Extensive comparison studies with state-of-the-art clustering approaches on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.
