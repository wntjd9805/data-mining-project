This paper presents a Generative prior ReciprocAtedInvertible rescaling Network (GRAIN) for generating faith-ful high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) invertible images with an extreme upscaling factor (64×).Previous researches have leveraged the prior knowledge of a pretrained GAN model to generate high-quality upscal-ing results. However, they fail to produce pixel-accurate results due to the highly ambiguous extreme mapping pro-cess. We remedy this problem by introducing a reciprocated invertible image rescaling process, in which high-resolution information can be delicately embedded into an invertible low-resolution image and generative prior for a faithful HR reconstruction. In particular, the invertible LR features not only carry signiﬁcant HR semantics, but also are trained to predict scale-speciﬁc latent codes, yielding a preferable utilization of generative features. On the other hand, the enhanced generative prior is re-injected to the rescaling pro-*Corresponding author (hesfe@scut.edu.cn). cess, compensating the lost details of the invertible rescal-ing. Our reciprocal mechanism perfectly integrates the ad-vantages of invertible encoding and generative prior, lead-ing to the ﬁrst feasible extreme rescaling solution. Exten-sive experiments demonstrate superior performance against state-of-the-art upscaling methods. Code is available at https://github.com/cszzx/GRAIN .
