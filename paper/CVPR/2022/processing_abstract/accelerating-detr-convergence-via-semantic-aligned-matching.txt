The recently developed DEtection TRansformer (DETR) establishes a new object detection paradigm by eliminat-ing a series of hand-crafted components. However, DETR suffers from extremely slow convergence, which increases the training cost significantly. We observe that the slow convergence is largely attributed to the complication in matching object queries with target features in different fea-ture embedding spaces. This paper presents SAM-DETR, a Semantic-Aligned-Matching DETR that greatly acceler-ates DETRâ€™s convergence without sacrificing its accuracy.SAM-DETR addresses the convergence issue from two per-spectives. First, it projects object queries into the same em-bedding space as encoded image features, where the match-ing can be accomplished efficiently with aligned seman-tics. Second, it explicitly searches salient points with the most discriminative features for semantic-aligned match-ing, which further speeds up the convergence and boosts de-tection accuracy as well. Being like a plug and play, SAM-DETR complements existing convergence solutions well yet only introduces slight computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SAM-DETR achieves superior convergence as well as competitive detection ac-curacy.
