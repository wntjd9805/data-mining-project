Pan-sharpening aims to obtain high-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images for remote sensing systems and deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable success.However, most existing methods are designed in a black-box principle, lacking sufficient interpretability. Addition-ally, they ignore the different characteristics of each band of MS images and directly concatenate them with panchro-matic (PAN) images, leading to severe copy artifacts [9]. To address the above issues, we propose an interpretable deep neural network, namely Memory-augmented Deep Condi-tional Unfolding Network with two specified core designs.Firstly, considering the degradation process, it formulates the Pan-sharpening problem as the minimization of a vari-ational model with denoising-based prior and non-local auto-regression prior which is capable of searching the similarities between long-range patches, benefiting the tex-ture enhancement. A novel iteration algorithm with built-in CNNs is exploited for transparent model design. Sec-ondly, to fully explore the potentials of different bands ofMS images, the PAN image is combined with each band ofMS images, selectively providing the high-frequency details and alleviating the copy artifacts. Extensive experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed algorithm against other state-of-the-art methods.
