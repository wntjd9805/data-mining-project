We propose a theoretical framework that generalizes simple and fast algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with both attractive and re-pulsive interactions between the nodes. This framework deﬁnes GASP, a Generalized Algorithm for Signed graphPartitioning1, and allows us to explore many combinations of different linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints.We prove the equivalence of existing clustering methods to some of those combinations and introduce new algo-rithms for combinations that have not been studied before.We study both theoretical and empirical properties of these combinations and prove that some of these deﬁne an ultra-metric on the graph. We conduct a systematic compari-son of various instantiations of GASP on a large variety of both synthetic and existing signed clustering problems, in terms of accuracy but also efﬁciency and robustness to noise. Lastly, we show that some of the algorithms included in our framework, when combined with the predictions from a CNN model, result in a simple bottom-up instance seg-mentation pipeline. Going all the way from pixels to ﬁnal segments with a simple procedure, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the CREMI 2016 EM segmentation bench-mark without requiring domain-speciﬁc superpixels.
