In this paper, we present a new large-scale dataset for the video panoptic segmentation task, which aims to as-sign semantic classes and track identities to all pixels in a video. As the ground truth for this task is difficult to an-notate, previous datasets for video panoptic segmentation are limited by either small scales or the number of scenes.In contrast, our large-scale VIdeo Panoptic Segmentation in the Wild (VIPSeg) dataset provides 3,536 videos and 84,750 frames with pixel-level panoptic annotations, cov-ering a wide range of real-world scenarios and categories.To the best of our knowledge, our VIPSeg is the first at-tempt to tackle the challenging video panoptic segmentation task in the wild by considering diverse scenarios. Based on VIPSeg, we evaluate existing video panoptic segmen-tation approaches and propose an efficient and effective clip-based baseline method to analyze our VIPSeg dataset.Our dataset is available at https://github.com/VIPSeg-Dataset/VIPSeg-Dataset/.
