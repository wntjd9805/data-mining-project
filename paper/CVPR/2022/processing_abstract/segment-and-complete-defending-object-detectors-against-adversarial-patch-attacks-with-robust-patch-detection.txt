Object detection plays a key role in many security-critical systems. Adversarial patch attacks, which are easy to im-plement in the physical world, pose a serious threat to state-of-the-art object detectors. Developing reliable de-fenses for object detectors against patch attacks is critical but severely understudied. In this paper, we propose Seg-ment and Complete defense (SAC), a general framework for defending object detectors against patch attacks through detection and removal of adversarial patches. We first train a patch segmenter that outputs patch masks which provide pixel-level localization of adversarial patches. We then pro-pose a self adversarial training algorithm to robustify the patch segmenter. In addition, we design a robust shape com-pletion algorithm, which is guaranteed to remove the entire patch from the images if the outputs of the patch segmenter are within a certain Hamming distance of the ground-truth patch masks. Our experiments on COCO and xView datasets demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness even under strong adaptive attacks with no reduction in perfor-mance on clean images, and generalizes well to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and unseen attack methods.Furthermore, we present the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which augments the APRICOT dataset with pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches. We show SAC can significantly re-duce the targeted attack success rate of physical patch at-tacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/ joellliu/SegmentAndComplete.
