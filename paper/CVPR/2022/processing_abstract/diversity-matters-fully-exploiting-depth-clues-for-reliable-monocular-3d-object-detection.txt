As an inherently ill-posed problem, depth estimation from single images is the most challenging part of monoc-ular 3D object detection (M3OD). Many existing methods rely on preconceived assumptions to bridge the missing spa-tial information in monocular images, and predict a sole depth value for every object of interest. However, these as-sumptions do not always hold in practical applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a depth solving system that fully explores the visual clues from the subtasks in M3OD and generates multiple estimations for the depth of each target. Since the depth estimations rely on different assump-tions in essence, they present diverse distributions. Even if some assumptions collapse, the estimations established on the remaining assumptions are still reliable. In addition, we develop a depth selection and combination strategy. This strategy is able to remove abnormal estimations caused by collapsed assumptions, and adaptively combine the remain-In this way, our depth ing estimations into a single one. solving system becomes more precise and robust. Exploit-ing the clues from multiple subtasks of M3OD and without introducing any extra information, our method surpasses the current best method by more than 20% relatively on theModerate level of test split in the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, while still maintaining real-time efficiency.
