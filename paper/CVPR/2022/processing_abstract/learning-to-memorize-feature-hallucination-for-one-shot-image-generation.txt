This paper studies the task of One-Shot image Gener-ation (OSG), where generation network learned on base dataset should be generalizable to synthesize images of novel categories with only one available sample per novel category. Most existing methods for feature transfer in one-shot image generation only learn reusable features implic-itly on pre-training tasks. Such methods would be likelyIn this paper, we propose to overfit pre-training tasks. a novel model to explicitly learn and memorize reusable features that can help hallucinate novel category images.To be specific, our algorithm learns to decompose im-age features into the Category-Related (CR) and Category-Independent(CI) features. Our model learning to memo-rize class-independent CI features which are further utilized by our feature hallucination component to generate target novel category images. We validate our model on several benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively boosts the OSG performance and can gen-erate compelling and diverse samples.
