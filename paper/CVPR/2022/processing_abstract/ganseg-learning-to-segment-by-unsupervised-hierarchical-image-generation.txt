Segmenting an image into its parts is a common pre-process for high-level vision tasks such as image editing.However, annotating masks for supervised training is ex-pensive. Weakly-supervised and unsupervised methods ex-ist, but they depend on the comparison of pairs of im-ages, such as from multi-views, frames of videos, and im-age augmentation, which limit their applicability. To ad-dress this, we propose a GAN-based approach that gener-ates images conditioned on latent masks, thereby alleviating full or weak annotations required by previous approaches.We show that such mask-conditioned image generation can be learned faithfully when conditioning the masks in a hi-erarchical manner on 2D latent points that deÔ¨Åne the po-sition of parts explicitly. Without requiring supervision of masks or points, this strategy increases robustness of mask to viewpoint and object position changes.It also lets us generate image-mask pairs for training a segmentation net-work, which outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised seg-mentation methods on established benchmarks.
