Equivariance has been a long-standing concern in vari-ous fields ranging from computer vision to physical model-ing. Most previous methods struggle with generality, sim-plicity, and expressiveness — some are designed ad hoc for specific data types, some are too complex to be accessible, and some sacrifice flexible transformations. In this work, we propose a novel and simple framework to achieve equiv-ariance for point cloud analysis based on the message pass-ing (graph neural network) scheme. We find the equivariant property could be obtained by introducing an orientation for each point to decouple the relative position for each point from the global pose of the entire point cloud. There-fore, we extend current message passing networks with a module that learns orientations for each point. Before ag-gregating information from the neighbors of a point, the net-works transforms the neighbors’ coordinates based on the point’s learned orientations. We provide formal proofs to show the equivariance of the proposed framework. Empir-ically, we demonstrate that our proposed method is com-petitive on both point cloud analysis and physical model-ing tasks.
