The large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs) facilitate the learning-based computational pathology methods. How-ever, the gigapixel size of WSIs makes it hard to train a conventional model directly. Current approaches typically adopt multiple-instance learning (MIL) to tackle this prob-lem. Among them, MIL combined with graph convolutional network (GCN) is a significant branch, where the sampled patches are regarded as the graph nodes to further discover their correlations. However, it is difficult to build corre-spondence across patches from different WSIs. Therefore, most methods have to perform non-ordered node pooling to generate the bag-level representation. Direct non-ordered pooling will lose much structural and contextual informa-tion, such as patch distribution and heterogeneous patterns, which is critical for WSI representation. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical global-to-local clustering strategy to build a Node-Aligned GCN (NAGCN) to represent WSI with rich local structural information as well as global distribu-tion. We first deploy a global clustering operation based on the instance features in the dataset to build the corre-spondence across different WSIs. Then, we perform a lo-cal clustering-based sampling strategy to select typical in-stances belonging to each cluster within the WSI. Finally, we employ the graph convolution to obtain the represen-tation. Since our graph construction strategy ensures the alignment among different WSIs, WSI-level representation can be easily generated and used for the subsequent classi-fication. The experiment results on two cancer subtype clas-sification datasets demonstrate our method achieves better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
