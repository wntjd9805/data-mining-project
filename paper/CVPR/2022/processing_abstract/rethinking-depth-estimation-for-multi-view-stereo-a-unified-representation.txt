Depth estimation is solved as a regression or classiﬁca-tion problem in existing learning-based multi-view stereo methods. Although these two representations have recently demonstrated their excellent performance, they still have apparent shortcomings, e.g., regression methods tend to overﬁt due to the indirect learning cost volume, and clas-siﬁcation methods cannot directly infer the exact depth due to its discrete prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel representation, termed Uniﬁcation, to unify the advantages of regression and classiﬁcation. It can directly constrain the cost volume like classiﬁcation methods, but also realize the sub-pixel depth prediction like regression methods. To exca-vate the potential of uniﬁcation, we design a new loss func-tion named Uniﬁed Focal Loss, which is more uniform and reasonable to combat the challenge of sample imbalance.Combining these two unburdened modules, we present a coarse-to-ﬁne framework, that we call UniMVSNet. The results of ranking ﬁrst on both DTU and Tanks and Temples benchmarks verify that our model not only performs the best but also has the best generalization ability.
