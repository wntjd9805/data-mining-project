Learning semantic segmentation from weakly-labeled (e.g., image tags only) data is challenging since it is hard to infer dense object regions from sparse semantic tags. De-spite being broadly studied, most current efforts directly learn from limited semantic annotations carried by individ-ual image or image pairs, and struggle to obtain integral localization maps. Our work alleviates this from a novel perspective, by exploring rich semantic contexts synergis-tically among abundant weakly-labeled training data for network learning and inference. In particular, we propose regional semantic contrast and aggregation (RCA) . RCA is equipped with a regional memory bank to store massive, di-verse object patterns appearing in training data, which acts as strong support for exploration of dataset-level semantic structure. Particularly, we propose i) semantic contrast to drive network learning by contrasting massive categorical object regions, leading to a more holistic object pattern un-derstanding, and ii) semantic aggregation to gather diverse relational contexts in the memory to enrich semantic repre-sentations. In this manner, RCA earns a strong capability of Ô¨Åne-grained semantic understanding, and eventually es-tablishes new state-of-the-art results on two popular bench-marks, i.e., PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014.
