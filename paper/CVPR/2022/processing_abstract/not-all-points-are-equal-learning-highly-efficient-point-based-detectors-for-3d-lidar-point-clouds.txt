We study the problem of efﬁcient object detection of 3DLiDAR point clouds. To reduce the memory and compu-tational cost, existing point-based pipelines usually adopt task-agnostic random sampling or farthest point sampling to progressively downsample input point clouds, despite the fact that not all points are equally important to the task of object detection. In particular, the foreground points are in-herently more important than background points for object detectors. Motivated by this, we propose a highly-efﬁcient single-stage point-based 3D detector in this paper, termedIA-SSD. The key of our approach is to exploit two learn-able, task-oriented, instance-aware downsampling strate-gies to hierarchically select the foreground points belong-ing to objects of interest. Additionally, we also introduce a contextual centroid perception module to further estimate precise instance centers. Finally, we build our IA-SSD fol-lowing the encoder-only architecture for efﬁciency. Exten-sive experiments conducted on several large-scale detec-tion benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of our IA-SSD. Thanks to the low memory footprint and a high degree of parallelism, it achieves a superior speed of 80+ frames-per-second on the KITTI dataset with a sin-gle RTX2080Ti GPU.
