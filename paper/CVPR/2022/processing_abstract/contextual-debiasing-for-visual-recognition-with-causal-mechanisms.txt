As a common problem in the visual world, contex-tual bias means the recognition may depend on the co-occurrence context rather than the objects themselves, which is even more severe in multi-label tasks due to mul-tiple targets and the absence of location. Although some studies have focused on tackling the problem, removing the negative effect of context is still challenging because it is difﬁcult to obtain the representation of contextual bias. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective framework em-ploying causal inference to mitigate contextual bias. Weﬁrst present a Structural Causal Model (SCM) clarifying the causal relation among object representations, context, and predictions. Then, we develop a novel Causal ContextDebiasing (CCD) Module to pursue the direct effect of an instance. Speciﬁcally, we adopt causal intervention to elim-inate the effect of confounder and counterfactual reasoning to obtain a Total Direct Effect (TDE) free from the contex-tual bias. Note that our CCD framework is orthogonal to existing statistical models and thus can be migrated to any other backbones. Extensive experiments on several multi-label classiﬁcation datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over other state-of-the-art baselines.
