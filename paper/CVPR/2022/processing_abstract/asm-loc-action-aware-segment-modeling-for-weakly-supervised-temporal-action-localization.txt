Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to recognize and localize action segments in untrimmed videos given only video-level action labels for training. Without the boundary information of action segments, existing meth-ods mostly rely on multiple instance learning (MIL), where the predictions of unlabeled instances (i.e., video snippets) are supervised by classifying labeled bags (i.e., untrimmed videos). However, this formulation typically treats snippets in a video as independent instances, ignoring the underly-ing temporal structures within and across action segments.To address this problem, we propose ASM-Loc, a novelWTAL framework that enables explicit, action-aware seg-ment modeling beyond standard MIL-based methods. Our framework entails three segment-centric components: (i) dynamic segment sampling for compensating the contribu-tion of short actions; (ii) intra- and inter-segment attention for modeling action dynamics and capturing temporal de-pendencies; (iii) pseudo instance-level supervision for im-proving action boundary prediction. Furthermore, a multi-step refinement strategy is proposed to progressively im-prove action proposals along the model training process.Extensive experiments on THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, estab-lishing new state of the art on both datasets.
