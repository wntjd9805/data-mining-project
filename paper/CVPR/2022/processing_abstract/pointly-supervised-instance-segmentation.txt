We propose an embarrassingly simple point annotation scheme to collect weak supervision for instance segmenta-tion. In addition to bounding boxes, we collect binary labels for a set of points uniformly sampled inside each bound-ing box. We show that the existing instance segmentation models developed for full mask supervision can be seam-lessly trained with point-based supervision collected via our scheme. Remarkably, Mask R-CNN trained on COCO,PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes, and LVIS with only 10 anno-tated random points per object achieves 94%â€“98% of its fully-supervised performance, setting a strong baseline for weakly-supervised instance segmentation. The new point annotation scheme is approximately 5 times faster than an-notating full object masks, making high-quality instance segmentation more accessible in practice.Inspired by the point-based annotation form, we propose a modification to PointRend instance segmentation mod-ule. For each object, the new architecture, called ImplicitPointRend, generates parameters for a function that makes the final point-level mask prediction.Implicit PointRend is more straightforward and uses a single point-level mask loss. Our experiments show that the new module is more suitable for the point-based supervision. 1
