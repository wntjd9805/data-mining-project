Referring video object segmentation (R-VOS) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to segment the target object referred by a language expression in all video frames.In this work, we propose a simple and unified framework built upon Transformer, termed ReferFormer. It views the language as queries and directly attends to the most rele-vant regions in the video frames. Concretely, we introduce a small set of object queries conditioned on the language as the input to the Transformer.In this manner, all the queries are obligated to find the referred objects only. They are eventually transformed into dynamic kernels which cap-ture the crucial object-level information, and play the role of convolution filters to generate the segmentation masks from feature maps. The object tracking is achieved natu-rally by linking the corresponding queries across frames.This mechanism greatly simplifies the pipeline and the end-to-end framework is significantly different from the previ-ous methods. Extensive experiments on Ref-Youtube-VOS,Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences show the effectiveness of ReferFormer. On Ref-Youtube-VOS,ReferFormer achieves 55.6 J &F with a ResNet-50 back-bone without bells and whistles, which exceeds the previ-ous state-of-the-art performance by 8.4 points. In addition, with the strong Video-Swin-Base backbone, ReferFormer achieves the best J &F of 64.9 among all existing meth-ods. Moreover, we show the impressive results of 55.0 mAP and 43.7 mAP on A2D-Sentences and JHMDB-Sentences respectively, which significantly outperforms the previous methods by a large margin.
