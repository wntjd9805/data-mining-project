The lack of large-scale noisy-clean image pairs restricts supervised denoising methodsâ€™ deployment in actual ap-plications. While existing unsupervised methods are able to learn image denoising without ground-truth clean im-ages, they either show poor performance or work under impractical settings (e.g., paired noisy images). In this pa-per, we present a practical unsupervised image denoising method to achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance.Our method only requires single noisy images and a noise model, which is easily accessible in practical raw image de-noising. It performs two steps iteratively: (1) Constructing a noisier-noisy dataset with random noise from the noise model; (2) training a model on the noisier-noisy dataset and using the trained model to refine noisy images to ob-tain the targets used in the next round. We further approx-imate our full iterative method with a fast algorithm for more efficient training while keeping its original high per-formance. Experiments on real-world, synthetic, and cor-related noise show that our proposed unsupervised denois-ing approach has superior performances over existing un-supervised methods and competitive performance with su-pervised methods. In addition, we argue that existing de-noising datasets are of low quality and contain only a small number of scenes. To evaluate raw image denoising perfor-mance in real-world applications, we build a high-quality raw image dataset SenseNoise-500 that contains 500 real-life scenes. The dataset can serve as a strong benchmark for better evaluating raw image denoising. Code and dataset will be released1
