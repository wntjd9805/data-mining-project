Deep Metric Learning (DML) proposes to learn met-ric spaces which encode semantic similarities as embed-ding space distances. These spaces should be transfer-able to classes beyond those seen during training. Com-monly, DML methods task networks to solve contrastive ranking tasks deﬁned over binary class assignments. How-ever, such approaches ignore higher-level semantic rela-tions between the actual classes. This causes learned em-bedding spaces to encode incomplete semantic context and misrepresent the semantic relation between classes, impact-ing the generalizability of the learned metric space. To tackle this issue, we propose a language guidance objec-tive for visual similarity learning. Leveraging language em-beddings of expert- and pseudo-classnames, we contextu-alize and realign visual representation spaces correspond-ing to meaningful language semantics for better semantic consistency. Extensive experiments and ablations provide a strong motivation for our proposed approach and show language guidance offering signiﬁcant, model-agnostic im-provements for DML, achieving competitive and state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.
