We present Lepard, a Learning based approach for partial point cloud matching in rigid and deformable scenes. The key characteristics are the following techniques that exploit 3D positional knowledge for point cloud match-ing: 1) An architecture that disentangles point cloud repre-sentation into feature space and 3D position space. 2) A position encoding method that explicitly reveals 3D rela-tive distance information through the dot product of vec-tors. 3) A repositioning technique that modiÔ¨Åes the cross-point-cloud relative positions. Ablation studies demon-strate the effectiveness of the above techniques.In rigid cases, Lepard combined with RANSAC and ICP demon-strates state-of-the-art registration recall of 93.9% / 71.3% on the 3DMatch / 3DLoMatch. In deformable cases, Lep-ard achieves +27.1% / +34.8% higher non-rigid feature matching recall than the prior art on our newly constructed 4DMatch / 4DLoMatch benchmark.
