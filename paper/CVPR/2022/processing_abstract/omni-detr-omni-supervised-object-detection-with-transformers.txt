We consider the problem of omni-supervised object de-tection, which can use unlabeled, fully labeled and weakly labeled annotations, such as image tags, counts, points, etc., for object detection. This is enabled by a unified architecture, Omni-DETR, based on the recent progress on student-teacher framework and end-to-end transformer based object detection. Under this unified architecture, dif-ferent types of weak labels can be leveraged to generate ac-curate pseudo labels, by a bipartite matching based filter-ing mechanism, for the model to learn. In the experiments,Omni-DETR has achieved state-of-the-art results on mul-tiple datasets and settings. And we have found that weak annotations can help to improve detection performance and a mixture of them can achieve a better trade-off be-tween annotation cost and accuracy than the standard com-plete annotation. These findings could encourage larger object detection datasets with mixture annotations. The code is available at https://github.com/amazon-research/omni-detr.
