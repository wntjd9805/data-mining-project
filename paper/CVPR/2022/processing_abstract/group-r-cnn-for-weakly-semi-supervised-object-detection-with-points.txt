We study the problem of weakly semi-supervised ob-ject detection with points (WSSOD-P), where the training data is combined by a small set of fully annotated images with bounding boxes and a large set of weakly-labeled im-ages with only a single point annotated for each instance.The core of this task is to train a point-to-box regressor on well-labeled images that can be used to predict cred-ible bounding boxes for each point annotation. We chal-lenge the prior belief that existing CNN-based detectors are not compatible with this task. Based on the classic R-CNN architecture, we propose an effective point-to-box re-gressor: Group R-CNN. Group R-CNN first uses instance-level proposal grouping to generate a group of proposals for each point annotation and thus can obtain a high re-call rate. To better distinguish different instances and im-prove precision, we propose instance-level proposal assign-ment to replace the vanilla assignment strategy adopted in original R-CNN methods. As naive instance-level as-signment brings converging difficulty, we propose instance-aware representation learning which consists of instance-aware feature enhancement and instance-aware parame-ter generation to overcome this issue. Comprehensive ex-periments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, Group R-CNN significantly outperforms the prior method Point DETR by 3.9 mAP with 5% well-labeled images, which is the most challenging scenario.
