Accurate facial landmarks are essential prerequisites for many tasks related to human faces. In this paper, an accu-rate facial landmark detector is proposed based on cascad-ed transformers. We formulate facial landmark detection as a coordinate regression task such that the model can be trained end-to-end. With self-attention in transformers, our model can inherently exploit the structured relationships be-tween landmarks, which would beneﬁt landmark detection under challenging conditions such as large pose and oc-clusion. During cascaded reﬁnement, our model is able to extract the most relevant image features around the target landmark for coordinate prediction, based on deformable attention mechanism, thus bringing more accurate align-ment.In addition, we propose a novel decoder that re-ﬁnes image features and landmark positions simultaneous-ly. With few parameter increasing, the detection perfor-mance improves further. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on several standard facial landmark detection benchmarks, and shows good generalization abil-ity in cross-dataset evaluation.
