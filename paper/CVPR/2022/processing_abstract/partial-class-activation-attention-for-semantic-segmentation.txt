Current attention-based methods for semantic segmen-tation mainly model pixel relation through pairwise affin-ity and coarse segmentation. For the first time, this paper explores modeling pixel relation via Class Activation Map (CAM). Beyond the previous CAM generated from image-level classification, we present Partial CAM, which sub-divides the task into region-level prediction and achieves better localization performance. In order to eliminate the intra-class inconsistency caused by the variances of local context, we further propose Partial Class Activation Atten-tion (PCAA) that simultaneously utilizes local and global class-level representations for attention calculation. Once obtained the partial CAM, PCAA collects local class cen-ters and computes pixel-to-class relation locally. Apply-ing local-specific representations ensures reliable results under different local contexts. To guarantee global con-sistency, we gather global representations from all local class centers and conduct feature aggregation. Experimen-tal results confirm that Partial CAM outperforms the pre-vious two strategies as pixel relation. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challeng-ing benchmarks including Cityscapes, Pascal Context, andADE20K.
