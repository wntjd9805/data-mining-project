While GANs can produce photo-realistic images in ideal conditions for certain domains, the generation of full-body human images remains difficult due to the diversity of iden-In-tities, hairstyles, clothing, and the variance in pose. stead of modeling this complex domain with a single GAN, we propose a novel method to combine multiple pretrainedGANs, where one GAN generates a global canvas (e.g., hu-man body) and a set of specialized GANs, or insets, focus on different parts (e.g., faces, shoes) that can be seamlessly inserted onto the global canvas. We model the problem as jointly exploring the respective latent spaces such that the generated images can be combined, by inserting the parts from the specialized generators onto the global can-vas, without introducing seams. We demonstrate the setup by combining a full body GAN with a dedicated high-quality face GAN to produce plausible-looking humans. We evalu-ate our results with quantitative metrics and user studies.
