Previous vision MLPs such as MLP-Mixer and ResMLP accept linearly ﬂattened image patches as input, making them inﬂexible for different input sizes and hard to capture spatial information. Such approach withholds MLPs from getting comparable performance with their transformer-based counterparts and prevents them from becoming a general backbone for computer vision. This paper presentsHire-MLP, a simple yet competitive vision MLP architecture via Hierarchical rearrangement, which contains two lev-els of rearrangements. Speciﬁcally, the inner-region rear-rangement is proposed to capture local information inside a spatial region, and the cross-region rearrangement is pro-posed to enable information communication between differ-ent regions and capture global context by circularly shifting all tokens along spatial directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Hire-MLP as a versatile backbone for various vision tasks. In particular, Hire-MLP achieves competitive results on image classiﬁcation, object detection and semantic segmentation tasks, e.g., 83.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.7% box AP and 44.8% maskAP on COCO val2017, and 49.9% mIoU on ADE20K, sur-passing previous transformer-based and MLP-based mod-els with better trade-off for accuracy and throughput.
