Talking gesture generation is a practical yet challeng-ing task that aims to synthesize gestures in line with speech.Gestures with meaningful signs can better convey useful in-formation and arouse sympathy in the audience. Current works focus on aligning gestures with the speech rhythms, which are difficult to mine the semantics and model seman-tic gestures explicitly. This paper proposes a novel SE-mantic Energized Generation (SEEG) method for semantic-aware gesture generation. Our method contains two parts:DEcoupled Mining module (DEM) and Semantic Energiz-ing Module (SEM). DEM decouples the semantic-irrelevant information from inputs and separately mines information for the beat and semantic gestures. SEM conducts seman-tic learning and produces semantic gestures. Apart from representational similarity, SEM requires the predictions to express the same semantics as the ground truth. Be-sides, a semantic prompter is designed in SEM to leverage the semantic-aware supervision to predictions. This pro-motes the networks to learn and generate semantic gestures.Experimental results reported in three metrics on differ-ent benchmarks prove that SEEG efficiently mines semantic cues and generates semantic gestures. SEEG outperforms other methods in all semantic-aware evaluations on differ-ent datasets. Qualitative evaluations also indicate the supe-riority of SEEG in semantic expressiveness.
