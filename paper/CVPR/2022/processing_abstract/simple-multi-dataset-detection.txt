How do we build a general and broad object detec-tion system? We use all labels of all concepts ever an-notated. These labels span diverse datasets with poten-tially inconsistent taxonomies.In this paper, we present a simple method for training a uniﬁed detector on multi-ple large-scale datasets. We use dataset-speciﬁc training protocols and losses, but share a common detection archi-tecture with dataset-speciﬁc outputs. We show how to au-tomatically integrate these dataset-speciﬁc outputs into a common semantic taxonomy.In contrast to prior work, our approach does not require manual taxonomy reconcilia-tion. Experiments show our learned taxonomy outperforms a expert-designed taxonomy in all datasets. Our multi-dataset detector performs as well as dataset-speciﬁc models on each training domain, and can generalize to new unseen dataset without ﬁne-tuning on them.
