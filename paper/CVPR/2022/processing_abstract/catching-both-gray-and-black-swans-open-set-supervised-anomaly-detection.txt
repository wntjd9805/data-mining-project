Despite most existing anomaly detection studies assume the availability of normal training samples only, a few la-beled anomaly examples are often available in many real-world applications, such as defect samples identiﬁed during random quality inspection, lesion images conﬁrmed by radi-ologists in daily medical screening, etc. These anomaly ex-amples provide valuable knowledge about the application-speciﬁc abnormality, enabling signiﬁcantly improved detec-tion of similar anomalies in some recent models. However, those anomalies seen during training often do not illus-trate every possible class of anomaly, rendering these mod-els ineffective in generalizing to unseen anomaly classes.This paper tackles open-set supervised anomaly detection, in which we learn detection models using the anomaly ex-amples with the objective to detect both seen anomalies (‘gray swans’) and unseen anomalies (‘black swans’). We propose a novel approach that learns disentangled repre-sentations of abnormalities illustrated by seen anomalies, pseudo anomalies, and latent residual anomalies (i.e., sam-ples that have unusual residuals compared to the normal data in a latent space), with the last two abnormalities de-signed to detect unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on nine real-world anomaly detection datasets show supe-rior performance of our model in detecting seen and unseen anomalies under diverse settings.
