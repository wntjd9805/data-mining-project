Prevailing video frame interpolation algorithms, that generate the intermediate frames from consecutive inputs, typically rely on complex model architectures with heavy parameters or large delay, hindering them from diverse real-time applications. In this work, we devise an efﬁcient encoder-decoder based network, termed IFRNet, for fast in-termediate frame synthesizing. It ﬁrst extracts pyramid fea-tures from given inputs, and then reﬁnes the bilateral in-termediate ﬂow ﬁelds together with a powerful intermedi-ate feature until generating the desired output. The gradu-ally reﬁned intermediate feature can not only facilitate in-termediate ﬂow estimation, but also compensate for con-textual details, making IFRNet do not need additional syn-thesis or reﬁnement module. To fully release its potential, we further propose a novel task-oriented optical ﬂow dis-tillation loss to focus on learning the useful teacher knowl-edge towards frame synthesizing. Meanwhile, a new ge-ometry consistency regularization term is imposed on the gradually reﬁned intermediate features to keep better struc-ture layout. Experiments on various benchmarks demon-strate the excellent performance and fast inference speed of proposed approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/ltkong218/IFRNet.
