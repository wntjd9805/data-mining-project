We propose a semi-supervised network for wide-angle portraits correction. Wide-angle images often suffer from skew and distortion affected by perspective distortion, espe-cially noticeable at the face regions. Previous deep learn-ing based approaches need the ground-truth correction flow maps for training guidance. However, such labels are ex-pensive, which can only be obtained manually.In this work, we design a semi-supervised scheme and build a high-quality unlabeled dataset with rich scenarios, allow-ing us to simultaneously use labeled and unlabeled data to improve performance. Specifically, our semi-supervised scheme takes advantage of the consistency mechanism, with several novel components such as direction and range con-sistency (DRC) and regression consistency (RC). Further-more, different from the existing methods, we propose theMulti-Scale Swin-Unet (MS-Unet) based on the multi-scale swin transformer block (MSTB), which can simultaneously learn short-distance and long-distance information to avoid artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the pro-posed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and other representative baselines.
