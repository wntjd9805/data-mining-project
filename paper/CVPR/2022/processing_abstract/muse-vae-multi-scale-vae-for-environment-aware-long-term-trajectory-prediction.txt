Accurate long-term trajectory prediction in complex scenes, where multiple agents (e.g., pedestrians or vehi-cles) interact with each other and the environment while at-tempting to accomplish diverse and often unknown goals, is a challenging stochastic forecasting problem.In this work, we propose MUSE-VAE, a new probabilistic model-ing framework based on a cascade of Conditional VAEs, which tackles the long-term, uncertain trajectory prediction task using a coarse-to-ﬁne multi-factor forecasting archi-tecture. In its Macro stage, the model learns a joint pixel-space representation of two key factors, the underlying en-vironment and the agent movements, to predict the long and short term motion goals. Conditioned on them, the Micro stage learns a ﬁne-grained spatio-temporal representation for the prediction of individual agent trajectories. The VAE backbones across the two stages make it possible to nat-urally account for the joint uncertainty at both levels of granularity. As a result, MUSE-VAE offers diverse and si-multaneously more accurate predictions compared to the current state-of-the-art. We demonstrate these assertions through a comprehensive set of experiments on nuScenes and SDD benchmarks as well as PFSD, a new synthetic dataset, which challenges the forecasting ability of models on complex agent-environment interaction scenarios.
