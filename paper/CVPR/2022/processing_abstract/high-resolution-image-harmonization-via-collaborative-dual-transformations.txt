Given a composite image, image harmonization aims to adjust the foreground to make it compatible with the background. High-resolution image harmonization is in high demand, but still remains unexplored. Conventional image harmonization methods learn global RGB-to-RGB transformation which could effortlessly scale to high reso-lution, but ignore diverse local context. Recent deep learn-ing methods learn the dense pixel-to-pixel transformation which could generate harmonious outputs, but are highly constrained in low resolution. In this work, we propose a high-resolution image harmonization network with Collab-orative Dual Transformation (CDTNet) to combine pixel-to-pixel transformation and RGB-to-RGB transformation coherently in an end-to-end network. Our CDTNet con-sists of a low-resolution generator for pixel-to-pixel trans-formation, a color mapping module for RGB-to-RGB trans-formation, and a reﬁnement module to take advantage of both. Extensive experiments on high-resolution bench-mark dataset and our created high-resolution real compos-ite images demonstrate that our CDTNet strikes a good balance between efﬁciency and effectiveness.
