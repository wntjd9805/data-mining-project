Existing GAN inversion methods fail to provide latent codes for reliable reconstruction and ﬂexible editing simul-taneously. This paper presents a transformer-based image inversion and editing model for pretrained StyleGAN which is not only with less distortions, but also of high quality and ﬂexibility for editing. The proposed model employs aCNN encoder to provide multi-scale image features as keys and values. Meanwhile it regards the style code to be deter-mined for different layers of the generator as queries. It ﬁrst initializes query tokens as learnable parameters and maps them into W + space. Then the multi-stage alternate self-and cross-attention are utilized, updating queries with the purpose of inverting the input by the generator. Moreover, based on the inverted code, we investigate the reference-and label-based attribute editing through a pretrained la-tent classiﬁer, and achieve ﬂexible image-to-image transla-tion with high quality results. Extensive experiments are carried out, showing better performances on both inversion and editing tasks within StyleGAN. Codes are available at https://github.com/sapphire497/style-transformer.
