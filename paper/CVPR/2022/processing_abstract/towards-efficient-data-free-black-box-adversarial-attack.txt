Classic black-box adversarial attacks can take advan-tage of transferable adversarial examples generated by a similar substitute model to successfully fool the target model. However, these substitute models need to be trained by target modelsâ€™ training data, which is hard to acquire due to privacy or transmission reasons. Recognizing the limited availability of real data for adversarial queries, re-cent works proposed to train substitute models in a data-free black-box scenario. However, their generative adver-sarial networks (GANs) based framework suffers from the convergence failure and the model collapse, resulting in low efficiency. In this paper, by rethinking the collabora-tive relationship between the generator and the substitute model, we design a novel black-box attack framework. The proposed method can efficiently imitate the target model through a small number of queries and achieve high at-tack success rate. The comprehensive experiments over six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against the state-of-the-art attacks. Especially, we con-duct both label-only and probability-only attacks on theMicrosoft Azure online model, and achieve a 100% attack success rate with only 0.46% query budget of the SOTA method [49].
