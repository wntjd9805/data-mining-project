Trajectory prediction is a critical functionality of au-tonomous systems that share environments with uncon-trolled agents, one prominent example being self-driving vehicles. Currently, most prediction methods do not en-force scene consistency, i.e., there are a substantial amount of self-collisions between predicted trajectories of differ-ent agents in the scene. Moreover, many approaches gen-erate individual trajectory predictions per agent instead of joint trajectory predictions of the whole scene, which makes downstream planning difﬁcult.In this work, we presentScePT, a policy planning-based trajectory prediction model that generates accurate, scene-consistent trajectory predic-tions suitable for autonomous system motion planning. It explicitly enforces scene consistency and learns an agent interaction policy that can be used for conditional predic-tion. Experiments on multiple real-world pedestrians and autonomous vehicle datasets show that ScePT matches cur-rent state-of-the-art prediction accuracy with signiﬁcantly improved scene consistency. We also demonstrate ScePT’s ability to work with a downstream contingency planner.
