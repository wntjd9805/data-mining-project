Advection-diffusion equations describe a large family of natural transport processes, e.g., fluid flow, heat transfer, and wind transport. They are also used for optical flow and perfusion imaging computations. We develop a ma-chine learning model, D2-SONATA, built upon a stochas-tic advection-diffusion equation, which predicts the velocity and diffusion fields that drive 2D/3D image time-series of transport. In particular, our proposed model incorporates a model of transport atypicality, which isolates abnormal dif-ferences between expected normal transport behavior and the observed transport. In a medical context such a normal-abnormal decomposition can be used, for example, to quan-tify pathologies. Specifically, our model identifies the ad-vection and diffusion contributions from the transport time-series and simultaneously predicts an anomaly value field to provide a decomposition into normal and abnormal ad-vection and diffusion behavior. To achieve improved estima-tion performance for the velocity and diffusion-tensor fields underlying the advection-diffusion process and for the esti-mation of the anomaly fields, we create a 2D/3D anomaly-encoded advection-diffusion simulator, which allows for su-pervised learning. We further apply our model on a brain perfusion dataset from ischemic stroke patients via trans-fer learning. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that our model successfully distinguishes stroke lesions (abnormal) from normal brain regions, while reconstructing the under-lying velocity and diffusion tensor fields.
