In this paper, we ﬁrst investigate the class-wise visual quality imbalance problem of scene images generated byGANs. The tendency is empirically found that the class-wise visual qualities are highly correlated with the dominance of object classes in the training data in terms of their scales and appearance frequencies. Speciﬁcally, the synthesized qualities of small and less frequent object classes tend to be low. To address this, we propose a novel attention module,Local Attention Pyramid (LAP) module tailored for scene image synthesis, that encourages GANs to generate diverse object classes in a high quality by explicit spread of high at-tention scores to local regions, since objects in scene images are scattered over the entire images. Moreover, our LAP as-signs attention scores in a multiple scale to reﬂect the scale diversity of various objects. The experimental evaluations on three different datasets show consistent improvements inFrechet Inception Distance (FID) and Frechet SegmentationDistance (FSD) over the state-of-the-art baselines. Further-more, we apply our LAP module to various GANs methods to demonstrate a wide applicability of our LAP module.
