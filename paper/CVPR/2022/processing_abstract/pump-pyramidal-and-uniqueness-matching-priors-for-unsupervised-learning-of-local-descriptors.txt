Existing approaches for learning local image descrip-tors have shown remarkable achievements in a wide range of geometric tasks. However, most of them require per-pixel correspondence-level supervision, which is difficult to ac-quire at scale and in high quality. In this paper, we propose to explicitly integrate two matching priors in a single loss in order to learn local descriptors without supervision. Given two images depicting the same scene, we extract pixel de-scriptors and build a correlation volume. The first prior enforces the local consistency of matches in this volume via a pyramidal structure iteratively constructed using a non-parametric module. The second prior exploits the fact that each descriptor should match with at most one descrip-tor from the other image. We combine our unsupervised loss with a standard self-supervised loss trained from syn-thetic image augmentations. Feature descriptors learned by the proposed approach outperform their fully- and self-supervised counterparts on various geometric benchmarks such as visual localization and image matching, achiev-ing state-of-the-art performance.
