Preserving geometric structures in the scene plays a vi-tal role in image stitching. However, most of the existing methods ignore the large-scale layouts reflected by straight lines or curves, decreasing overall stitching quality. To ad-dress this issue, this work presents a structure-preserving stitching approach that produces images with natural vi-sual effects and less distortion. Our method first employs deep learning-based edge detection to extract various types of large-scale edges. Then, the extracted edges are sampled to construct multiple groups of triangles to represent geo-metric structures. Meanwhile, a GEometric Structure pre-serving (GES) energy term is introduced to make these tri-angles undergo similarity transformation. Further, an op-timized GES energy term is presented to reasonably deter-mine the weights of the sampling points on the geometric structure, and the term is added into the Global Similar-ity Prior (GSP) stitching model called GES-GSP to achieve a smooth transition between local alignment and geomet-ric structure preservation. The effectiveness of GES-GSP is validated through comprehensive experiments on a stitch-ing dataset. The experimental results show that the pro-posed method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in geometric structure preservation and obtains more nat-ural stitching results.
