Image restoration tasks have witnessed great perfor-mance improvement in recent years by developing large deep models. Despite the outstanding performance, the heavy computation demanded by the deep models has re-stricted the application of image restoration. To lift the re-striction, it is required to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. Recently, N :M structured pruning has appeared as one of the effective and practical pruning approaches for making the model efﬁcient with the accuracy constraint. However, it fails to account for differ-ent computational complexities and performance require-ments for different layers of an image restoration network.To further optimize the trade-off between the efﬁciency and the restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N :M struc-tured sparsity at each layer. Extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our method which outperforms previous prun-ing methods signiﬁcantly. PyTorch implementation for the proposed methods will be publicly available at https://github.com/JungHunOh/SLS_CVPR2022
