Pedestrian counting is a fundamental tool for under-standing pedestrian patterns and crowd flow analysis. Ex-isting works (e.g., image-level pedestrian counting, cross-line crowd counting et al.) either only focus on the image-level counting or are constrained to the manual annotationIn this work, we propose to conduct the pedes-of lines. trian counting from a new perspective - Video IndividualCounting (VIC), which counts the total number of individ-ual pedestrians in the given video (a person is only counted once). Instead of relying on the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) techniques, we propose to solve the problem by de-composing all pedestrians into the initial pedestrians who existed in the first frame and the new pedestrians with sep-arate identities in each following frame. Then, an end-to-end Decomposition and Reasoning Network (DRNet) is designed to predict the initial pedestrian count with the density estimation method and reason the new pedestrianâ€™s count of each frame with the differentiable optimal trans-port. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets with congested pedestrians and diverse scenes, demonstrat-ing the effectiveness of our method over baselines with great superiority in counting the individual pedestrians.
