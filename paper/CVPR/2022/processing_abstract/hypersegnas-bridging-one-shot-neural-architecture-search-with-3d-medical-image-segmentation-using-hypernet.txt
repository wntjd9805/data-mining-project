Semantic segmentation of 3D medical images is a chal-lenging task due to the high variability of the shape and pattern of objects (such as organs or tumors). Given the recent success of deep learning in medical image segmen-tation, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been intro-duced to find high-performance 3D segmentation network architectures. However, because of the massive computa-tional requirements of 3D data and the discrete optimiza-tion nature of architecture search, previous NAS methods require a long search time or necessary continuous relax-ation, and commonly lead to sub-optimal network architec-tures. While one-shot NAS can potentially address these disadvantages, its application in the segmentation domain has not been well studied in the expansive multi-scale multi-path search space. To enable one-shot NAS for medical im-age segmentation, our method, named HyperSegNAS, intro-duces a HyperNet to assist super-net training by incorpo-rating architecture topology information. Such a Hyper-Net can be removed once the super-net is trained and in-troduces no overhead during architecture search. We show that HyperSegNAS yields better performing and more intu-itive architectures compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation networks; furthermore, it can quickly and accurately find good architecture candidates under dif-ferent computing constraints. Our method is evaluated on public datasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, and achieves SOTA performances.
