A practical eye authentication (EA) system targeted for edge devices needs to perform authentication and be ro-bust to presentation attacks, all while remaining compute and latency efﬁcient. However, existing eye-based frame-works a) perform authentication and Presentation AttackDetection (PAD) independently and b) involve signiﬁcant pre-processing steps to extract the iris region. Here, we in-troduce a joint framework for EA and PAD using periocular images. While a deep Multitask Learning (MTL) network can perform both the tasks, MTL suffers from the forget-ting effect since the training datasets for EA and PAD are disjoint. To overcome this, we propose Eye Authentication with PAD (EyePAD), a distillation-based method that trains a single network for EA and PAD while reducing the effect of forgetting. To further improve the EA performance, we introduce a novel approach called EyePAD++ that includes training an MTL network on both EA and PAD data, while distilling the ‘versatility’ of the EyePAD network through an additional distillation step. Our proposed methods outper-form the SOTA in PAD and obtain near-SOTA performance in eye-to-eye veriﬁcation, without any pre-processing. We also demonstrate the efﬁcacy of EyePAD and EyePAD++ in user-to-user veriﬁcation with PAD across network back-bones and image quality.
