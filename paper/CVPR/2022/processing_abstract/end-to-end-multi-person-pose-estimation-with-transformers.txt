Current methods of multi-person pose estimation typi-cally treat the localization and association of body joints separately. In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst fully end-to-end multi-person Pose Estimation framework with TRans-formers, termed PETR. Our method views pose estimation as a hierarchical set prediction problem and effectively re-moves the need for many hand-crafted modules like RoI cropping, NMS and grouping post-processing.In PETR, multiple pose queries are learned to directly reason a set of full-body poses. Then a joint decoder is utilized to fur-ther reﬁne the poses by exploring the kinematic relations between body joints. With the attention mechanism, the proposed method is able to adaptively attend to the fea-tures most relevant to target keypoints, which largely over-comes the feature misalignment difﬁculty in pose estimation and improves the performance considerably. Extensive ex-periments on the MS COCO and CrowdPose benchmarks show that PETR plays favorably against state-of-the-art ap-proaches in terms of both accuracy and efﬁciency.
