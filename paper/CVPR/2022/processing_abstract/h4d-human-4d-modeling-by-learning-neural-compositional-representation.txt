Despite the impressive results achieved by deep learning based 3D reconstruction, the techniques of directly learning to model 4D human captures with detailed geometry have been less studied. This work presents a novel framework that can effectively learn a compact and compositional rep-resentation for dynamic human by exploiting the human body prior from the widely used SMPL parametric model.Particularly, our representation, named H4D, represents a dynamic 3D human over a temporal span with the SMPL parameters of shape and initial pose, and latent codes en-coding motion and auxiliary information. A simple yet ef-fective linear motion model is proposed to provide a rough and regularized motion estimation, followed by per-frame compensation for pose and geometry details with the resid-ual encoded in the auxiliary code. Technically, we intro-duce novel GRU-based architectures to facilitate learning and improve the representation capability. Extensive exper-iments demonstrate our method is not only efficacy in re-covering dynamic human with accurate motion and detailed geometry, but also amenable to various 4D human related tasks, including motion retargeting, motion completion and future prediction.
