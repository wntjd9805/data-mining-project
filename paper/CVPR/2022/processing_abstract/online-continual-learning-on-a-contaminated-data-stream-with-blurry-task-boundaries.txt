Learning under a continuously changing data distribu-tion with incorrect labels is a desirable real-world problem yet challenging. A large body of continual learning (CL) methods, however, assumes data streams with clean labels, and online learning scenarios under noisy data streams are yet underexplored. We consider a more practical CL task setup of an online learning from blurry data stream with corrupted labels, where existing CL methods strug-gle. To address the task, we first argue the importance of both diversity and purity of examples in the episodic mem-ory of continual learning models. To balance diversity and purity in the episodic memory, we propose a novel strat-egy to manage and use the memory by a unified approach of label noise aware diverse sampling and robust learn-ing with semi-supervised learning. Our empirical valida-tions on four real-world or synthetic noise datasets (CI-FAR10 and 100, mini-WebVision, and Food-101N) exhibit that our method significantly outperforms prior arts in this realistic and challenging continual learning scenario.
