Real-world autonomous driving datasets comprise of im-ages aggregated from different drives on the road. The ability to relight captured scenes to unseen lighting con-ditions, in a controllable manner, presents an opportunity to augment datasets with a richer variety of lighting con-ditions, similar to what would be encountered in the real-world. This paper presents a novel image-based relight-ing pipeline, SIMBAR, that can work with a single image as input. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work on scene relighting leveraging explicit geometric rep-resentations from a single image. We present qualitative comparisons with prior multi-view scene relighting base-lines. To further validate and effectively quantify the ben-efit of leveraging SIMBAR for data augmentation for au-tomated driving vision tasks, object detection and tracking experiments are conducted with a state-of-the-art method, a Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) of 93.3% is achieved with CenterTrack on SIMBAR-augmented KITTI -an impressive 9.0% relative improvement over the baselineMOTA of 85.6% with CenterTrack on original KITTI, both models trained from scratch and tested on Virtual KITTI.For more details and sample relit datasets, please visit our project website (https://simbarv1.github.io).
