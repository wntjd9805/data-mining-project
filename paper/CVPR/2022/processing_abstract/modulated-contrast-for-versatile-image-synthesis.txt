Perceiving the similarity between images has been a long-standing and fundamental problem underlying various visual generation tasks. Predominant approaches measure the inter-image distance by computing pointwise absolute deviations, which tends to estimate the median of instance distributions and leads to blurs and artifacts in the gener-ated images. This paper presents MoNCE, a versatile met-ric that introduces image contrast to learn a calibrated met-ric for the perception of multifaceted inter-image distances.Unlike vanilla contrast which indiscriminately pushes neg-ative samples from the anchor regardless of their similar-ity, we propose to re-weight the pushing force of negative samples adaptively according to their similarity to the an-chor, which facilitates the contrastive learning from infor-mative negative samples. Since multiple patch-level con-trastive objectives are involved in image distance measure-ment, we introduce optimal transport in MoNCE to modu-late the pushing force of negative samples collaboratively across multiple contrastive objectives. Extensive experi-ments over multiple image translation tasks show that the proposed MoNCE outperforms various prevailing metrics substantially. The code is available at MoNCE.
