In LiDAR-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving, the ratio of the object size to input scene size is sig-niﬁcantly smaller compared to 2D detection cases. Over-looking this difference, many 3D detectors directly follow the common practice of 2D detectors, which downsample the feature maps even after quantizing the point clouds.In this paper, we start by rethinking how such multi-stride stereotype affects the LiDAR-based 3D object detectors.Our experiments point out that the downsampling opera-tions bring few advantages, and lead to inevitable infor-mation loss. To remedy this issue, we propose Single-stride Sparse Transformer (SST) to maintain the original resolution from the beginning to the end of the network.Armed with transformers, our method addresses the prob-lem of insufﬁcient receptive ﬁeld in single-stride architec-tures.It also cooperates well with the sparsity of point clouds and naturally avoids expensive computation. Even-tually, our SST achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset. It is worth mentioning that our method can achieve exciting performance (83.8 LEVEL 1AP on validation split) on small object (pedestrian) detec-tion due to the characteristic of single stride. Our codes will be public soon.
