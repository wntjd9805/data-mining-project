WSITarget Tiles (ROI)Target Sub-tiles (ROI)An increasing number of applications in computer vi-sion, specially, in medical imaging and remote sensing, be-come challenging when the goal is to classify very large im-ages with tiny informative objects. Speciﬁcally, these classi-ﬁcation tasks face two key challenges: i) the size of the input image is usually in the order of mega- or giga-pixels, how-ever, existing deep architectures do not easily operate on such big images due to memory constraints, consequently, we seek a memory-efﬁcient method to process these im-ages; and ii) only a very small fraction of the input im-ages are informative of the label of interest, resulting in low region of interest (ROI) to image ratio. However, most of the current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are de-signed for image classiﬁcation datasets that have relatively large ROIs and small image sizes (sub-megapixel). Existing approaches have addressed these two challenges in isola-tion. We present an end-to-end CNN model termed Zoom-In network that leverages hierarchical attention sampling for classiﬁcation of large images with tiny objects using a single GPU. We evaluate our method on four large-image histopathology, road-scene and satellite imaging datasets, and one gigapixel pathology dataset. Experimental results show that our model achieves higher accuracy than existing methods while requiring less memory resources.
