Classifying all cells in an organ is a relevant and dif-ficult problem from plant developmental biology. We here abstract the problem into a new benchmark for node clas-sification in a geo-referenced graph. Solving it requires learning the spatial layout of the organ including symme-tries. To allow the convenient testing of new geometrical learning methods, the benchmark of Arabidopsis thaliana ovules is made available as a PyTorch data loader, along with a large number of precomputed features. Finally, we benchmark eight recent graph neural network architectures, finding that DeeperGCN currently works best on this prob-lem.
