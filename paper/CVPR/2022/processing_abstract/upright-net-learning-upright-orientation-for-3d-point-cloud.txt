A mass of experiments shows that the pose of the in-put 3D models exerts a tremendous influence on automatic 3D shape analysis. In this paper, we propose Upright-Net, a deep-learning-based approach for estimating the upright orientation of 3D point clouds. Based on a well-known pos-tulate of design states that ”form ever follows function”, we treat the natural base of an object as a common functional structure, which supports the object in a most commonly seen pose following a set of specific rules, e.g. physical laws, functionality-related geometric properties, semantic cues, and so on. Thus we apply a data-driven deep learn-ing method to automatically encode those rules and formu-late the upright orientation estimation problem as a classi-fication model, i.e. extract the points on a 3D model that forms the natural base. And then the upright orientation is computed as the normal of the natural base. Our proposed new approach has three advantages. First, it formulates the continuous orientation estimation task as a discrete classi-fication task while preserving the continuity of the solution space. Second, it automatically learns the comprehensive criteria defining a natural base of general 3D models even with asymmetric geometry. Third, the learned orientation-aware features can serve well in downstream tasks. Results show that our network outperforms previous approaches on orientation estimation and also achieves remarkable gener-alization capability and transfer capability.
