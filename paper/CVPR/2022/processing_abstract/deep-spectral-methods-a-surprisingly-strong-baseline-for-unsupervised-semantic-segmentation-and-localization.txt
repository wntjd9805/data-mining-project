Unsupervised localization and segmentation are long-standing computer vision challenges that involve decom-posing an image into semantically meaningful segments without any labeled data. These tasks are particularly in-teresting in an unsupervised setting due to the difficulty and cost of obtaining dense image annotations, but existing un-supervised approaches struggle with complex scenes con-taining multiple objects. Differently from existing methods, which are purely based on deep learning, we take inspira-tion from traditional spectral segmentation methods by re-framing image decomposition as a graph partitioning prob-lem. Specifically, we examine the eigenvectors of the Lapla-cian of a feature affinity matrix from self-supervised net-works. We find that these eigenvectors already decompose an image into meaningful segments, and can be readily used to localize objects in a scene. Furthermore, by clus-tering the features associated with these segments across a dataset, we can obtain well-delineated, nameable re-gions, i.e. semantic segmentations. Experiments on complex datasets (PASCAL VOC, MS-COCO) demonstrate that our simple spectral method outperforms the state-of-the-art in unsupervised localization and segmentation by a significant margin. Furthermore, our method can be readily used for a variety of complex image editing tasks, such as background removal and compositing. 1
