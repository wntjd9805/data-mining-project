Standard DetectorRemoteTable??BoxTV?Train TestPainting?BinCupOver the years various methods have been proposed for the problem of object detection. Recently, we have wit-nessed great strides in this domain owing to the emer-gence of powerful deep neural networks. However, there are typically two main assumptions common among these approaches. First, the model is trained on a ﬁxed training set and is evaluated on a pre-recorded test set. Second, the model is kept frozen after the training phase, so no further updates are performed after the training is ﬁnished. These two assumptions limit the applicability of these methods to real-world settings. In this paper, we propose Interactron, a method for adaptive object detection in an interactive set-ting, where the goal is to perform object detection in images observed by an embodied agent navigating in different envi-ronments. Our idea is to continue training during inference and adapt the model at test time without any explicit super-vision via interacting with the environment. Our adaptive object detection model provides a 11.8 point improvement inAP (and 19.1 points in AP50) over DETR [5], a recent, high-performance object detector. Moreover, we show that our object detection model adapts to environments with com-pletely different appearance characteristics, and its per-formance is on par with a model trained with full super-vision for those environments.
