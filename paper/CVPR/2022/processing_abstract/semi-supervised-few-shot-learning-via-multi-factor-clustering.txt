The scarcity of labeled data and the problem of model overﬁtting have been the challenges in few-shot learning.Recently, semi-supervised few-shot learning has been de-veloped to obtain pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples for expanding the support set. However, the relationship be-tween unlabeled and labeled data is not well exploited in generating pseudo labels, the noise of which will di-rectly harm the model learning.In this paper, we pro-pose a Clustering-based semi-supervised Few-Shot Learn-ing (cluster-FSL) method to solve the above problems in image classiﬁcation. By using multi-factor collaborative representation, a novel Multi-Factor Clustering (MFC) is designed to fuse the information of few-shot data distribu-tion, which can generate soft and hard pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples based on labeled data. And we exploit the pseudo labels of unlabeled samples by MFC to expand the support set for obtaining more distribution informa-tion. Furthermore, robust data augmentation is used for support set in the ﬁne-tuning phase to increase the labeled samples’ diversity. We veriﬁed the validity of the cluster-FSL by comparing it with other few-shot learning meth-ods on three popular benchmark datasets, miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and CUB-200-2011. The ablation exper-iments further demonstrate that our MFC can effectively fuse distribution information of labeled samples and pro-vide high-quality pseudo-labels.
