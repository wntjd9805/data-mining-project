Although many video prediction methods have obtained good performance in low-resolution (64∼128) videos, pre-dictive models for high-resolution (512∼4K) videos have not been fully explored yet, which are more meaningful due to the increasing demand for high-quality videos. Com-pared with low-resolution videos, high-resolution videos contain richer appearance (spatial) information and more complex motion (temporal) information.In this paper, we propose a Spatiotemporal Residual Predictive Model (STRPM) for high-resolution video prediction. On the one hand, we propose a Spatiotemporal Encoding-DecodingScheme to preserve more spatiotemporal information for high-resolution videos. In this way, the appearance details for each frame can be greatly preserved. On the other hand, we design a Residual Predictive Memory (RPM) which focuses on modeling the spatiotemporal residual features (STRF) between previous and future frames instead of the whole frame, which can greatly help capture the complex motion information in high-resolution videos. In addition, the proposed RPM can supervise the spatial encoder and temporal encoder to extract different features in the spatial domain and the temporal domain, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model is trained using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a learned perceptual loss (LP-loss) to improve the perceptual quality of the predictions. Exper-imental results show that STRPM can generate more satis-factory results compared with various existing methods.*Corresponding author: Shanshe Wang, sswang@pku.edu.cn.

Qualitative results between the proposed STRPM and the state-of-the-art method CrevNet [29] on the SJTU4K dataset (4K: 2160×3840 resolution, 4 frames → 1 frame). STRPM has generated much better visual details compared with CrevNet.
