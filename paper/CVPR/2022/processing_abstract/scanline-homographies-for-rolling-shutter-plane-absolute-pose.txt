GS imageRS image rectiﬁed RS imageCameras on portable devices are manufactured with a rolling-shutter (RS) mechanism, where the image rows (aka. scanlines) are read out sequentially. The unknown cam-era motions during the imaging process cause the so-calledRS effects which are solved by motion assumptions in the literature.In this work, we give a solution to the abso-lute pose problem free of motion assumptions. We cate-gorically demonstrate that the only requirement is motion smoothness instead of stronger constraints on the camera motion. To this end, we propose a novel mathematical ab-straction for RS cameras observing a planar scene, called the scanline-homography, a 3 × 2 matrix with 5 DOFs. We establish the relationship between a scanline-homography and the corresponding plane-homography, a 3 × 3 ma-trix with 6 DOFs assuming the camera is calibrated. We estimate the scanline-homographies of an RS frame us-ing a smooth image warp powered by B-Splines, and re-cover the plane-homographies afterwards to obtain the scanline-poses based on motion smoothness. We back our claims with various experiments. Code and new datasets: https: / / bitbucket.org/ clermontferrand / planarscanlinehomography/src/master/.
