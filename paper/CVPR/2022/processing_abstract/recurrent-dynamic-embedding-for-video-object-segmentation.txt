Memory bankSpace-time memory (STM) based video object segmen-tation (VOS) networks usually keep increasing memory bank every several frames, which shows excellent perfor-mance. However, 1) the hardware cannot withstand the ever-increasing memory requirements as the video length increases. 2) Storing lots of information inevitably intro-duces lots of noise, which is not conducive to reading the most important information from the memory bank.In this paper, we propose a Recurrent Dynamic Embedding (RDE) to build a memory bank of constant size. Speciﬁ-cally, we explicitly generate and update RDE by the pro-posed Spatio-temporal Aggregation Module (SAM), which exploits the cue of historical information. To avoid error accumulation owing to the recurrent usage of SAM, we pro-pose an unbiased guidance loss during the training stage, which makes SAM more robust in long videos. Moreover, the predicted masks in the memory bank are inaccurate due to the inaccurate network inference, which affects the seg-mentation of the query frame. To address this problem, we design a novel self-correction strategy so that the network can repair the embeddings of masks with different quali-ties in the memory bank. Extensive experiments show our method achieves the best tradeoff between performance and speed. Code is available at https://github.com/Limingxing00/RDE-VOS-CVPR2022.

The inference pipelines of the segmentation of frame c(cid:2) denotes concatenation. θ denotes the sampling intervalT . for the update of the memory bank. (a) shows the network read the space-time memory (STM) pattern memory bank to segment frame T . As the length of videos increases, the STM pattern mem-ory bank has an ever-increasing size. In (b), we update a recurrent dynamic embedding (RDE) to build a memory bank of the con-stant size, which is maintained by a spatio-temporal aggregation module (SAM).
