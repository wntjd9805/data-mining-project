While neural representations for static 3D shapes are widely studied, representations for deformable surfaces are limited to be template-dependent or to lack efficiency.We introduce Canonical Deformation Coordinate Space (CaDeX), a unified representation of both shape and non-rigid motion. Our key insight is the factorization of the de-formation between frames by continuous bijective canon-ical maps (homeomorphisms) and their inverses that go through a learned canonical shape. Our novel deforma-tion representation and its implementation are simple, ef-ficient, and guarantee cycle consistency, topology preser-vation, and, if needed, volume conservation. Our mod-elling of the learned canonical shapes provides a flexible and stable space for shape prior learning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in modelling a wide range of deformable geometries: human bodies, animal bodies, and articulated objects. 1
