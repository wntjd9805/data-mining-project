We present Polarity Sampling, a theoretically justified plug-and-play method for controlling the generation quality and diversity of any pre-trained deep generative network (DGN). Leveraging the fact that DGNs are, or can be ap-proximated by, continuous piecewise affine splines, we de-rive the analytical DGN output space distribution as a func-tion of the product of the DGN’s Jacobian singular val-ues raised to a power ρ. We dub ρ the polarity param-eter and prove that ρ focuses the DGN sampling on the modes (ρ < 0) or anti-modes (ρ > 0) of the DGN output-space probability distribution. We demonstrate that nonzero polarity values achieve a better precision-recall (quality-diversity) Pareto frontier than standard methods, such as truncation, for a number of state-of-the-art DGNs. We also present quantitative and qualitative results on the improve-ment of overall generation quality (e.g., in terms of theFr´echet Inception Distance) for a number of state-of-the-art DGNs, including StyleGAN3, BigGAN-deep, NVAE, for different conditional and unconditional image generation tasks. In particular, Polarity Sampling redefines the state-of-the-art for StyleGAN2 on the FFHQ Dataset to FID 2.57,StyleGAN2 on the LSUN Car Dataset to FID 2.27 and Style-GAN3 on the AFHQv2 Dataset to FID 3.95.
