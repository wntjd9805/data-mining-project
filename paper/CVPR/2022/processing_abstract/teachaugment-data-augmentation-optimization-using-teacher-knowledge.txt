Optimization of image transformation functions for the purpose of data augmentation has been intensively studied.In particular, adversarial data augmentation strategies, which search augmentation maximizing task loss, show sig-nificant improvement in the model generalization for many tasks. However, the existing methods require careful param-eter tuning to avoid excessively strong deformations that take away image features critical for acquiring generaliza-tion.In this paper, we propose a data augmentation op-timization method based on the adversarial strategy calledTeachAugment, which can produce informative transformed images to the model without requiring careful tuning by leveraging a teacher model. Specifically, the augmentation is searched so that augmented images are adversarial for the target model and recognizable for the teacher model.We also propose data augmentation using neural networks, which simplifies the search space design and allows for up-dating of the data augmentation using the gradient method.We show that TeachAugment outperforms existing methods in experiments of image classification, semantic segmenta-tion, and unsupervised representation learning tasks.
