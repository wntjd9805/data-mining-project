Conditioned and composed image retrieval extend CBIR systems by combining a query image with an additional text that expresses the intent of the user, describing additional requests w.r.t. the visual content of the query image. This type of search is interesting for e-commerce applications, to develop interactive multimodal searches and chat-e.g. bots. In this demo, we present an interactive system based on a combiner network, trained using contrastive learning, that combines visual and textual features obtained from theOpenAI CLIP network to address conditioned CBIR. The system can be used to improve e-shop search engines. For example, considering the fashion domain it lets users search for dresses, shirts and toptees using a candidate start image and expressing some visual differences w.r.t. its visual con-tent, e.g. asking to change color, pattern or shape. The pro-posed network obtains state-of-the-art performance on theFashionIQ dataset and on the more recent CIRR dataset, showing its applicability to the fashion domain for condi-tioned retrieval, and to more generic content considering the more general task of composed image retrieval.Figure 1. Example of use of conditioned image in the fashion domain for e-commerce application. The user can refine product search providing details and constraints in natural language. The system uses both visual and textual features to retrieve the desired result.
