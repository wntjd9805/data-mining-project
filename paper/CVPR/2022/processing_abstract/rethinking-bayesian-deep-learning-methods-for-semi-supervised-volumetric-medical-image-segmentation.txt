Recently, several Bayesian deep learning methods have been proposed for semi-supervised medical image segmen-tation. Although they have achieved promising results on medical benchmarks, some problems are still existing. Firstly, their overall architectures belong to the discriminative mod-els, and hence, in the early stage of training, they only use la-beled data for training, which might make them overﬁt to the labeled data. Secondly, in fact, they are only partially based on Bayesian deep learning, as their overall architectures are not designed under the Bayesian framework. However, unifying the overall architecture under the Bayesian perspec-tive can make the architecture have a rigorous theoretical basis, so that each part of the architecture can have a clear probabilistic interpretation. Therefore, to solve the prob-lems, we propose a new generative Bayesian deep learning (GBDL) architecture. GBDL belongs to the generative mod-els, whose target is to estimate the joint distribution of input medical volumes and their corresponding labels. Estimating the joint distribution implicitly involves the distribution of data, so both labeled and unlabeled data can be utilized in the early stage of training, which alleviates the potential overﬁtting problem. Besides, GBDL is completely designed under the Bayesian framework, and thus we give its fullBayesian formulation, which lays a theoretical probabilistic foundation for our architecture. Extensive experiments show that our GBDL outperforms previous state-of-the-art meth-ods in terms of four commonly used evaluation indicators on three public medical datasets.
