We present a deformable prototypical part network (De-formable ProtoPNet), an interpretable image classifier that integrates the power of deep learning and the interpretabil-ity of case-based reasoning. This model classifies input images by comparing them with prototypes learned during training, yielding explanations in the form of “this looks like that.” However, while previous methods use spatially rigid prototypes, we address this shortcoming by proposing spatially flexible prototypes. Each prototype is made up of several prototypical parts that adaptively change their rel-ative spatial positions depending on the input image. Con-sequently, a Deformable ProtoPNet can explicitly capture pose variations and context, improving both model accu-racy and the richness of explanations provided. Compared to other case-based interpretable models using prototypes, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and gives an explanation with greater context.
