In this paper, we propose a conceptually novel, effi-cient, and fully convolutional framework for real-time in-stance segmentation. Previously, most instance segmen-tation methods heavily rely on object detection and per-form mask prediction based on bounding boxes or dense centers. In contrast, we propose a sparse set of instance activation maps, as a new object representation, to high-light informative regions for each foreground object. Then instance-level features are obtained by aggregating fea-tures according to the highlighted regions for recognition and segmentation. Moreover, based on bipartite match-ing, the instance activation maps can predict objects in a one-to-one style, thus avoiding non-maximum suppression (NMS) in post-processing. Owing to the simple yet effec-tive designs with instance activation maps, SparseInst has extremely fast inference speed and achieves 40 FPS and 37.9 AP on the COCO benchmark, which significantly out-performs the counterparts in terms of speed and accuracy.Code and models are available at https://github. com/hustvl/SparseInst.
