Lane is critical in the vision navigation system of the in-telligent vehicle. Naturally, lane is a trafﬁc sign with high-level semantics, whereas it owns the speciﬁc local pattern which needs detailed low-level features to localize accu-rately. Using different feature levels is of great importance for accurate lane detection, but it is still under-explored.In this work, we present Cross Layer Reﬁnement Net-work (CLRNet) aiming at fully utilizing both high-level and low-level features in lane detection. In particular, it ﬁrst de-tects lanes with high-level semantic features then performs reﬁnement based on low-level features. In this way, we can exploit more contextual information to detect lanes while leveraging local detailed lane features to improve localiza-tion accuracy. We present ROIGather to gather global con-text, which further enhances the feature representation of lanes. In addition to our novel network design, we introduceLine IoU loss which regresses the lane line as a whole unit to improve the localization accuracy. Experiments demon-strate that the proposed method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art lane detection approaches. Code is avail-able at:https://github.com/Turoad/CLRNet.
