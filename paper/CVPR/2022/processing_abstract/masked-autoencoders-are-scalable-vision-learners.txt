This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. OurMAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that oper-ates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask to-kens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we ﬁnd that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two de-signs enables us to train large models efﬁciently and ef-fectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and im-prove accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanillaViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer per-formance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.
