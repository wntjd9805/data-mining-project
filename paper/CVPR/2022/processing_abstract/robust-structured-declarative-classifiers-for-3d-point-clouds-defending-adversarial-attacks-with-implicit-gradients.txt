Deep neural networks for 3D point cloud classiﬁcation, such as PointNet, have been demonstrated to be vulnera-ble to adversarial attacks. Current adversarial defenders often learn to denoise the (attacked) point clouds by recon-struction, and then feed them to the classiﬁers as input. In contrast to the literature, we propose a family of robust structured declarative classiﬁers for point cloud classiﬁ-cation, where the internal constrained optimization mech-anism can effectively defend adversarial attacks through implicit gradients. Such classiﬁers can be formulated using a bilevel optimization framework. We further propose an effective and efﬁcient instantiation of our approach, namely,Lattice Point Classiﬁer (LPC), based on structured sparse coding in the permutohedral lattice and 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that is end-to-end trainable. We demonstrate state-of-the-art robust point cloud classiﬁca-tion performance on ModelNet40 and ScanNet under seven different attackers. For instance, we achieve 89.51% and 83.16% test accuracy on each dataset under the recentJGBA attacker that outperforms DUP-Net and IF-Defense with PointNet by ∼70%.
