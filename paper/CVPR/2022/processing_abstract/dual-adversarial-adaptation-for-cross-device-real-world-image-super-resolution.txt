Due to the sophisticated imaging process, an identical scene captured by different cameras could exhibit distinct imaging patterns, introducing distinct proficiency among the super-resolution (SR) models trained on images from different devices. In this paper, we investigate a novel and practical task coded cross-device SR, which strives to adapt a real-world SR model trained on the paired images cap-tured by one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured by arbitrary target devices. The proposed task is highly challenging due to the absence of paired data from vari-ous imaging devices. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism for real-worldSR, named Dual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA), which only requires LR images in the target domain with avail-able real paired data from a source camera. DADA em-ploys the Domain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to es-tablish the basis of target model training even without HR supervision. Furthermore, the dual framework of DADA fa-cilitates an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) in one branch for two LR input images from two domains, and an Intra-domain Adversarial Adaptation (IntraAA) in two branches for an LR input image.InterAA and In-traAA together improve the model transferability from the source domain to the target. We empirically conduct ex-periments under six Realâ†’Real adaptation settings among three different cameras, and achieve superior performance compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches. We also evaluate the proposed DADA to address the adapta-tion to the video camera, which presents a promising re-search topic to promote the wide applications of real-world super-resolution.
