Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on image-level labels has attracted much attention due to low annotation costs. Existing methods often rely onClass Activation Mapping (CAM) that measures the corre-lation between image pixels and classiﬁer weight. However, the classiﬁer focuses only on the discriminative regions while ignoring other useful information in each image, re-sulting in incomplete localization maps. To address this is-sue, we propose a Self-supervised Image-speciﬁc PrototypeExploration (SIPE) that consists of an Image-speciﬁc Pro-totype Exploration (IPE) and a General-Speciﬁc Consis-tency (GSC) loss. Speciﬁcally, IPE tailors prototypes for ev-ery image to capture complete regions, formed our Image-Speciﬁc CAM (IS-CAM), which is realized by two sequential steps. In addition, GSC is proposed to construct the con-sistency of general CAM and our speciﬁc IS-CAM, which further optimizes the feature representation and empow-ers a self-correction ability of prototype exploration. Ex-tensive experiments are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 segmentation benchmark and results show our SIPE achieves new state-of-the-art performance using only image-level labels.
