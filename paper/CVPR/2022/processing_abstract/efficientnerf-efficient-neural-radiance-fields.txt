Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has been wildly applied to various tasks for its high-quality representation of 3D scenes. It takes long per-scene training time and per-imageIn this paper, we present EfﬁcientNeRF as testing time. an efﬁcient NeRF-based method to represent 3D scene and synthesize novel-view images. Although several ways exist to accelerate the training or testing process, it is still dif-ﬁcult to much reduce time for both phases simultaneously.We analyze the density and weight distribution of the sam-pled points then propose valid and pivotal sampling at the coarse and ﬁne stage, respectively, to signiﬁcantly improveIn addition, we design a novel data sampling efﬁciency. structure to cache the whole scene during testing to accel-erate the rendering speed. Overall, our method can reduce over 88% of training time, reach rendering speed of over 200 FPS, while still achieving competitive accuracy. Ex-periments prove that our method promotes the practical-ity of NeRF in the real world and enables many applica-tions. The code is available in https://github.com/dvlab-research/EfﬁcientNeRF.
