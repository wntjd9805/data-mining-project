Matching cost construction is a key step in light ﬁeld (LF) depth estimation, but was rarely studied in the deep learning era. Recent deep learning-based LF depth es-timation methods construct matching cost by sequentially shifting each sub-aperture image (SAI) with a series of pre-deﬁned offsets, which is complex and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a simple and fast cost constructor to construct matching cost for LF depth estimation. Our cost constructor is composed by a series of convolutions with speciﬁcally designed dilation rates. By applying our cost constructor to SAI arrays, pixels under predeﬁned dispari-ties can be integrated and matching cost can be constructed without using any shifting operation. More importantly, the proposed cost constructor is occlusion-aware and can han-dle occlusions by dynamically modulating pixels from dif-ferent views. Based on the proposed cost constructor, we develop a deep network for LF depth estimation. Our net-work ranks ﬁrst on the commonly used 4D LF benchmark in terms of the mean square error (MSE), and achieves a faster running time than other state-of-the-art methods.
