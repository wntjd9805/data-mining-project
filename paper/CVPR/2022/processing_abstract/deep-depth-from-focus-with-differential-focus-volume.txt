Depth-from-focus (DFF) is a technique that infers depth using the focus change of a camera. In this work, we pro-pose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to find the best-focused pixels in a focal stack and infer depth from the fo-cus estimation. The key innovation of the network is the novel deep differential focus volume (DFV). By computing the first-order derivative with the stacked features over dif-ferent focal distances, DFV is able to capture both the fo-cus and context information for focus analysis. Besides, we also introduce a probability regression mechanism for focus estimation to handle sparsely sampled focal stacks and pro-vide uncertainty estimation to the final prediction. Compre-hensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets with good generalizability and fast speed.
