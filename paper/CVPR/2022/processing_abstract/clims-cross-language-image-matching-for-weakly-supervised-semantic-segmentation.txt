It has been widely known that CAM (Class ActivationMap) usually only activates discriminative object regions and falsely includes lots of object-related backgrounds. As only a ﬁxed set of image-level object labels are available to the WSSS (weakly supervised semantic segmentation) model, it could be very difﬁcult to suppress those diverse background regions consisting of open set objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross Language Image Match-ing (CLIMS) framework, based on the recently introducedContrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, for WSSS. The core idea of our framework is to introduce natural language supervision to activate more complete ob-ject regions and suppress closely-related open background regions. In particular, we design object, background region and text label matching losses to guide the model to excite more reasonable object regions for CAM of each category.In addition, we design a co-occurring background sup-pression loss to prevent the model from activating closely-related background regions, with a predeﬁned set of class-related background text descriptions. These designs enable the proposed CLIMS to generate a more complete and com-pact activation map for the target objects. Extensive exper-iments on PASCAL VOC2012 dataset show that our CLIMS signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art meth-ods. Code will be available at https://github.com/CVI-SZU/CLIMS.
