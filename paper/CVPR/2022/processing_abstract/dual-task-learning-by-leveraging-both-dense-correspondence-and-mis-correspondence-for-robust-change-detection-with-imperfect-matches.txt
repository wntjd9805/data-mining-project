Accurate change detection enables a wide range of tasks in visual surveillance, anomaly detection and mo-bile robotics. However, contemporary change detection ap-proaches assume an ideal matching between the current and stored scenes, whereas only coarse matching is possible in real-world scenarios. Thus, contemporary approaches fail to show the reported performance in real-world settings. To overcome this limitation, we propose SimSaC. SimSaC con-currently conducts scene flow estimation and change detec-tion and is able to detect changes with imperfect matches.To train SimSaC without additional manual labeling, we propose a training scheme with random geometric trans-formations and the cut-paste method. Moreover, we design an evaluation protocol which reflects performance in real-world settings. In designing the protocol, we collect a test benchmark dataset, which we claim as another contribu-tion. Our comprehensive experiments verify that SimSaC displays robust performance even given imperfect matches and the performance margin compared to contemporary ap-proaches is huge.
