In this paper, we introduce VCSL (Video Copy SegmentLocalization), a new comprehensive segment-level anno-tated video copy dataset. Compared with existing copy de-tection datasets restricted by either video-level annotation or small-scale, VCSL not only has two orders of magnitude more segment-level labelled data, with 160k realistic video copy pairs containing more than 280k localized copied seg-ment pairs, but also covers a variety of video categories and a wide range of video duration. All the copied seg-ments inside each collected video pair are manually ex-tracted and accompanied by precisely annotated starting and ending timestamps. Alongside the dataset, we also propose a novel evaluation protocol that better measures the prediction accuracy of copy overlapping segments be-tween a video pair and shows improved adaptability in dif-ferent scenarios. By benchmarking several baseline and state-of-the-art segment-level video copy detection methods with the proposed dataset and evaluation metric, we pro-vide a comprehensive analysis that uncovers the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, hoping to open up promising directions for future works. The VCSL dataset, metric and benchmark codes are all publicly available at https://github.com/alipay/VCSL.
