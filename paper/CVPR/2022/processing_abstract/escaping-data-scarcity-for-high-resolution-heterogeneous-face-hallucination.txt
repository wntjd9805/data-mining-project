In Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), the objective is to match faces across two different domains such as vis-ible and thermal. Large domain discrepancy makes HFR a difﬁcult problem. Recent methods attempting to ﬁll the gap via synthesis have achieved promising results, but their performance is still limited by the scarcity of paired train-ing data. In practice, large-scale heterogeneous face data are often inaccessible due to the high cost of acquisition and annotation process as well as privacy regulations. In this paper, we propose a new face hallucination paradigm for HFR, which not only enables data-efﬁcient synthesis but also allows to scale up model training without breaking any privacy policy. Unlike existing methods that learn face syn-thesis entirely from scratch, our approach is particularly designed to take advantage of rich and diverse facial priors from visible domain for more faithful hallucination. On the other hand, large-scale training is enabled by introducing a new federated learning scheme to allow institution-wise col-laborations while avoiding explicit data sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our approach in tackling HFR under current data limitations. In a uniﬁed framework, our method yields the state-of-the-art hallucina-tion results on multiple HFR datasets.
