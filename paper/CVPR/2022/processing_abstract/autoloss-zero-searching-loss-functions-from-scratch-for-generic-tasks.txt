Signiﬁcant progress has been achieved in automating the design of various components in deep networks. How-ever, the automatic design of loss functions for generic tasks with various evaluation metrics remains under-investigated.Previous works on handcrafting loss functions heavily rely on human expertise, which limits their extensibility. Mean-while, searching for loss functions is nontrivial due to the vast search space. Existing efforts mainly tackle the issue by employing task-speciﬁc heuristics on speciﬁc tasks and par-ticular metrics. Such work cannot be extended to other tasks without arduous human effort.In this paper, we proposeAutoLoss-Zero, which is a general framework for searching loss functions from scratch for generic tasks. Speciﬁcally, we design an elementary search space composed only of primitive mathematical operators to accommodate the het-erogeneous tasks and evaluation metrics. A variant of the evolutionary algorithm is employed to discover loss func-tions in the elementary search space. A loss-rejection pro-tocol and a gradient-equivalence-check strategy are devel-oped so as to improve the search efﬁciency, which are ap-plicable to generic tasks. Extensive experiments on various computer vision tasks demonstrate that our searched loss functions are on par with or superior to existing loss func-tions, which generalize well to different datasets and net-works. Code shall be released.
