Video deblurring has achieved remarkable progress thanks to the success of deep neural networks. Most meth-ods solve for the deblurring end-to-end with limited in-formation propagation from the video sequence. How-ever, different frame regions exhibit different characteris-tics and should be provided with corresponding relevant information. To achieve fine-grained deblurring, we de-signed a memory branch to memorize the blurry-sharp fea-ture pairs in the memory bank, thus providing useful infor-mation for the blurry query input. To enrich the memory of our memory bank, we further designed a bidirectional recurrency and multi-scale strategy based on the memory bank. Experimental results demonstrate that our model out-performs other state-of-the-art methods while keeping the model complexity and inference time low.
