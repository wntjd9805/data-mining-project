As a fundamental problem in computer vision, 3D ob-ject detection is experiencing rapid growth. To extract the point-wise features from the irregularly and sparsely dis-tributed points, previous methods usually take a feature grouping module to aggregate the point features to an ob-ject candidate. However, these methods have not yet lever-aged the surface geometry of foreground objects to enhance grouping and 3D box generation.In this paper, we pro-pose the RBGNet framework, a voting-based 3D detector for accurate 3D object detection from point clouds. In or-der to learn better representations of object shape to en-hance cluster features for predicting 3D boxes, we propose a ray-based feature grouping module, which aggregates the point-wise features on object surfaces using a group of de-termined rays uniformly emitted from cluster centers. Con-sidering the fact that foreground points are more meaning-ful for box estimation, we design a novel foreground biased sampling strategy in downsample process to sample more points on object surfaces and further boost the detection performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D de-tection performance on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D with remarkable performance gains. Code will be available at https://github.com/Haiyang-W/RBGNet.
