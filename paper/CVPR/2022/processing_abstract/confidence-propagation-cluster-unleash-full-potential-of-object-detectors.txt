It’s been a long history that most object detection meth-ods obtain objects by using the non-maximum suppression (NMS) and its improved versions like Soft-NMS to remove redundant bounding boxes. We challenge those NMS-based methods from three aspects: 1) The bounding box with highest conﬁdence value may not be the true positive hav-ing the biggest overlap with the ground-truth box. 2) Not only suppression is required for redundant boxes, but also conﬁdence enhancement is needed for those true positives. 3) Sorting candidate boxes by conﬁdence values is not nec-essary so that full parallelism is achievable.In this paper, inspired by belief propagation (BP), we propose the Conﬁdence Propagation Cluster (CP-Cluster) to replace NMS-based methods, which is fully parallelizable as well as better in accuracy. In CP-Cluster, we borrow the message passing mechanism from BP to penalize redundant boxes and enhance true positives simultaneously in an iter-ative way until convergence. We veriﬁed the effectiveness of CP-Cluster by applying it to various mainstream detec-tors such as FasterRCNN, SSD, FCOS, YOLOv3, YOLOv5,Centernet etc. Experiments on MS COCO show that our plug and play method, without retraining detectors, is able to steadily improve average mAP of all those state-of-the-art models with a clear margin from 0.3 to 1.9 respectively when compared with NMS-based methods.
