Rich semantics inside an image result in its ambiguous relationship with others, i.e., two images could be similar in one condition but dissimilar in another. Given triplets like “aircraft” is similar to “bird” than “train”, Weakly Su-pervised Conditional Similarity Learning (WS-CSL) learns multiple embeddings to match semantic conditions without explicit condition labels such as “can fly”. However, sim-ilarity relationships in a triplet are uncertain except pro-viding a condition. For example, the previous compari-son becomes invalid once the conditional label changes to“is vehicle”. To this end, we introduce a novel evaluation criterion by predicting the comparison’s correctness after assigning the learned embeddings to their optimal condi-tions, which measures how much WS-CSL could cover la-tent semantics as the supervised model. Furthermore, we propose the Distance Induced Semantic COndition VER-ification Network (DISCOVERNET), which characterizes the instance-instance and triplets-condition relations in a“decompose-and-fuse” manner. To make the learned em-beddings cover all semantics, DISCOVERNET utilizes a set module or an additional regularizer over the correspon-dence between a triplet and a condition. DISCOVERNET achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks likeUT-Zappos-50k and Celeb-A w.r.t. different criteria.
