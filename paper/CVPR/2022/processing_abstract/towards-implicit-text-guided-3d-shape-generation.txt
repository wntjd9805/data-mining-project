In this work, we explore the challenging task of gener-ating 3D shapes from text. Beyond the existing works, we propose a new approach for text-guided 3D shape gener-ation, capable of producing high-fidelity shapes with col-ors that match the given text description. This work has several technical contributions. First, we decouple the shape and color predictions for learning features in both texts and shapes, and propose the word-level spatial trans-former to correlate word features from text with spatial features from shape. Also, we design a cyclic loss to en-courage consistency between text and shape, and introduce the shape IMLE to diversify the generated shapes. Fur-ther, we extend the framework to enable text-guided shape manipulation. Extensive experiments on the largest ex-isting text-shape benchmark [10] manifest the superiority of this work. The code and the models are available at https://github.com/liuzhengzhe/Towards- Implicit-Text-Guided-Shape-Generation.
