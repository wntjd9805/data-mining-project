Understanding animalsâ€™ behaviors is significant for a wide range of applications. However, existing animal be-havior datasets have limitations in multiple aspects, in-cluding limited numbers of animal classes, data samples and provided tasks, and also limited variations in environ-mental conditions and viewpoints. To address these lim-itations, we create a large and diverse dataset, AnimalKingdom, that provides multiple annotated tasks to enable a more thorough understanding of natural animal behav-iors. The wild animal footages used in our dataset record different times of the day in extensive range of environ-ments containing variations in backgrounds, viewpoints, il-lumination and weather conditions. More specifically, our dataset contains 50 hours of annotated videos to localize relevant animal behavior segments in long videos for the video grounding task, 30K video sequences for the fine-grained multi-label action recognition task, and 33K frames for the pose estimation task, which correspond to a diverse range of animals with 850 species across 6 major animal classes. Such a challenging and comprehensive dataset shall be able to facilitate the community to develop, adapt, and evaluate various types of advanced methods for ani-mal behavior analysis. Moreover, we propose a Collabo-rative Action Recognition (CARe) model that learns gen-eral and specific features for action recognition with un-seen new animals. This method achieves promising perfor-mance in our experiments. Our dataset can be found at https://sutdcv.github.io/Animal-Kingdom.
