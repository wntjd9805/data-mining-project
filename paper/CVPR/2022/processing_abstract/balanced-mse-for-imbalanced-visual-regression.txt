Data imbalance exists ubiquitously in real-world visual regressions, e.g., age estimation and pose estimation, hurt-ing the modelâ€™s generalizability and fairness. Thus, im-balanced regression gains increasing research attention recently. Compared to imbalanced classification, imbal-anced regression focuses on continuous labels, which can be boundless and high-dimensional and hence more chal-lenging.In this work, we identify that the widely usedMean Square Error (MSE) loss function can be ineffec-tive in imbalanced regression. We revisit MSE from a sta-tistical view and propose a novel loss function, BalancedMSE, to accommodate the imbalanced training label dis-tribution. We further design multiple implementations ofBalanced MSE to tackle different real-world scenarios, par-ticularly including the one that requires no prior knowl-edge about the training label distribution. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, Balanced MSE is the first gen-eral solution to high-dimensional imbalanced regression in modern context. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and three real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effective-ness of Balanced MSE. Code and models are available at github.com/jiawei-ren/BalancedMSE.
