Recent advances in implicit neural representations and differentiable rendering make it possible to simultaneously recover the geometry and materials of an object from multi-view RGB images captured under unknown static illumina-tion. Despite the promising results achieved, indirect illu-mination is rarely modeled in previous methods, as it re-quires expensive recursive path tracing which makes the inverse rendering computationally intractable. In this pa-per, we propose a novel approach to efficiently recovering spatially-varying indirect illumination. The key insight is that indirect illumination can be conveniently derived from the neural radiance field learned from input images instead of being estimated jointly with direct illumination and ma-terials. By properly modeling the indirect illumination and visibility of direct illumination, interreflection- and shadow-free albedo can be recovered. The experiments on both syn-thetic and real data demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to previous work and its capa-bility to synthesize realistic renderings under novel view-points and illumination.
