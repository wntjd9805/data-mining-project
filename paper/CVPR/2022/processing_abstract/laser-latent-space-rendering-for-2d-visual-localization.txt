We present LASER, an image-based Monte Carlo Local-ization (MCL) framework for 2D ﬂoor maps. LASER in-troduces the concept of latent space rendering, where 2D pose hypotheses on the ﬂoor map are directly rendered into a geometrically-structured latent space by aggregat-ing viewing ray features. Through a tightly coupled ren-dering codebook scheme, the viewing ray features are dy-namically determined at rendering-time based on their ge-ometries (i.e. length, incident-angle), endowing our repre-sentation with view-dependent ﬁne-grain variability. Our codebook scheme effectively disentangles feature encoding from rendering, allowing the latent space rendering to run at speeds above 10KHz. Moreover, through metric learn-ing, our geometrically-structured latent space is common to both pose hypotheses and query images with arbitrary ﬁeld of views. As a result, LASER achieves state-of-the-art per-formance on large-scale indoor localization datasets (i.e.ZInD [5] and Structured3D [38]) for both panorama and perspective image queries, while signiﬁcantly outperform-ing existing learning-based methods in speed.
