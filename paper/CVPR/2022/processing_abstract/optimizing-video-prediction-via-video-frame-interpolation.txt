Video prediction is an extrapolation task that predicts future frames given past frames, and video frame interpo-lation is an interpolation task that estimates intermediate frames between two frames. We have witnessed the tremen-dous advancement of video frame interpolation, but the gen-eral video prediction in the wild is still an open question.Inspired by the photo-realistic results of video frame in-terpolation, we present a new optimization framework for video prediction via video frame interpolation, in which we solve an extrapolation problem based on an interpolation model. Our video prediction framework is based on opti-mization with a pretrained differentiable video frame inter-polation module without the need for a training dataset, and thus there is no domain gap issue between training and test data. Also, our approach does not need any additional in-formation such as semantic or instance maps, which makes our framework applicable to any video. Extensive exper-iments on the Cityscapes, KITTI, DAVIS, Middlebury, andVimeo90K datasets show that our video prediction results are robust in general scenarios, and our approach outper-forms other video prediction methods that require a large amount of training data or extra semantic information.
