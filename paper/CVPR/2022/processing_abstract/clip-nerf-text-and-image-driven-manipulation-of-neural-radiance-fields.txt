We present CLIP-NeRF, a multi-modal 3D object manip-ulation method for neural radiance ﬁelds (NeRF). By lever-aging the joint language-image embedding space of the recent Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, we propose a uniﬁed framework that allows manip-ulating NeRF in a user-friendly way, using either a short text prompt or an exemplar image. Speciﬁcally, to com-bine the novel view synthesis capability of NeRF and the controllable manipulation ability of latent representations from generative models, we introduce a disentangled condi-tional NeRF architecture that allows individual control over both shape and appearance. This is achieved by performing the shape conditioning via applying a learned deformationﬁeld to the positional encoding and deferring color condi-tioning to the volumetric rendering stage. To bridge this disentangled latent representation to the CLIP embedding, we design two code mappers that take a CLIP embedding as input and update the latent codes to reﬂect the targeted editing. The mappers are trained with a CLIP-based match-ing loss to ensure the manipulation accuracy. Furthermore, we propose an inverse optimization method that accurately projects an input image to the latent codes for manipulation to enable editing on real images. We evaluate our approach by extensive experiments on a variety of text prompts and exemplar images and also provide an intuitive interface for interactive editing.
