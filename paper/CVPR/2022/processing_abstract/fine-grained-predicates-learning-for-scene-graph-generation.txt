or e.g.,The performance of current Scene Graph Generation models is severely hampered by some hard-to-distinguish“woman-on/standing on/walking on-predicates,“woman-near/looking at/in front of-child”. beach”While general SGG models are prone to predict head predicates and existing re-balancing strategies prefer tail categories, none of them can appropriately handle these hard-to-distinguish predicates. To tackle this issue, inspired by fine-grained image classification, which focuses on differentiating among hard-to-distinguish object classes, we propose a method named Fine-Grained PredicatesLearning (FGPL) which aims at differentiating among hard-to-distinguish predicates for Scene Graph Gener-ation task.Specifically, we first introduce a PredicateLattice that helps SGG models to figure out fine-grained predicate pairs.Then, utilizing the Predicate Lattice, we propose a Category Discriminating Loss and anEntity Discriminating Loss, which both contribute to distinguishing fine-grained predicates while maintaining learned discriminatory power over recognizable ones. The proposed model-agnostic strategy significantly boosts the performances of three benchmark models (Transformer,VCTree, and Motif) by 22.8%, 24.1% and 21.7% of MeanRecall (mR@100) on the Predicate Classification sub-task, respectively. Our model also outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (i.e., 6.1%, 4.6%, and 3.2% ofMean Recall (mR@100)) on the Visual Genome dataset.Codes are publicly available1.
