Recent years have witnessed signiﬁcant progress in the area of single image dehazing, thanks to the employment of deep neural networks and diverse datasets. Most of the ex-isting methods perform well when the training and testing are conducted on a single dataset. However, they are not able to handle different types of hazy images using a de-hazing model trained on a particular dataset. One possible remedy is to perform training on multiple datasets jointly.However, we observe that this training strategy tends to compromise the model performance on individual datasets.Motivated by this observation, we propose a test-time train-ing method which leverages a helper network to assist the dehazing model in better adapting to a domain of inter-est. Speciﬁcally, during the test time, the helper network evaluates the quality of the dehazing results, then directs the dehazing network to improve the quality by adjusting its parameters via self-supervision. Nevertheless, the inclu-sion of the helper network does not automatically ensure the desired performance improvement. For this reason, a meta-learning approach is employed to make the objectives of the dehazing and helper networks consistent with each other.We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by providing extensive supporting experiments.
