In contrast to the generic object, aerial targets are of-ten non-axis aligned with arbitrary orientations having the cluttered surroundings. Unlike the mainstreamed ap-proaches regressing the bounding box orientations, this paper proposes an effective adaptive points learning ap-proach to aerial object detection by taking advantage of the adaptive points representation, which is able to cap-ture the geometric information of the arbitrary-oriented instances. To this end, three oriented conversion func-tions are presented to facilitate the classiﬁcation and lo-calization with accurate orientation. Moreover, we pro-pose an effective quality assessment and sample assign-ment scheme for adaptive points learning toward choos-ing the representative oriented reppoints samples during training, which is able to capture the non-axis aligned fea-tures from adjacent objects or background noises. A spa-tial constraint is introduced to penalize the outlier points for roust adaptive learning. Experimental results on four challenging aerial datasets including DOTA, HRSC2016,UCAS-AOD and DIOR-R, demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our proposed approach.The source code is availabel at: https://github.com/LiWentomng/OrientedRepPoints.
