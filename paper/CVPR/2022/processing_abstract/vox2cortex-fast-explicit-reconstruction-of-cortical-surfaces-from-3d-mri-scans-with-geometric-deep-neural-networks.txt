The reconstruction of cortical surfaces from brain mag-netic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is essential for quan-titative analyses of cortical thickness and sulcal morphol-ogy. Although traditional and deep learning-based algo-rithmic pipelines exist for this purpose, they have two major drawbacks: lengthy runtimes of multiple hours (traditional) or intricate post-processing, such as mesh extraction and topology correction (deep learning-based).In this work, we address both of these issues and propose Vox2Cortex, a deep learning-based algorithm that directly yields topo-logically correct, three-dimensional meshes of the bound-aries of the cortex. Vox2Cortex leverages convolutional and graph convolutional neural networks to deform an initial template to the densely folded geometry of the cortex repre-sented by an input MRI scan. We show in extensive exper-iments on three brain MRI datasets that our meshes are as accurate as the ones reconstructed by state-of-the-art meth-ods in the field, without the need for time- and resource-intensive post-processing. To accurately reconstruct the tightly folded cortex, we work with meshes containing about 168,000 vertices at test time, scaling deep explicit recon-struction methods to a new level.
