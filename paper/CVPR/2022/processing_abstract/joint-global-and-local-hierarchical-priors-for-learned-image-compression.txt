Recently, learned image compression methods have out-performed traditional hand-crafted ones including BPG.One of the keys to this success is learned entropy models that estimate the probability distribution of the quantized latent representation. Like other vision tasks, most recent learned entropy models are based on convolutional neu-ral networks (CNNs). However, CNNs have a limitation in modeling long-range dependencies due to their nature of local connectivity, which can be a significant bottleneck in image compression where reducing spatial redundancy is a key point. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel entropy model called Information Transformer (Informer) that exploits both global and local information in a content-dependent manner using an attention mechanism. Our ex-periments show that Informer improves rateâ€“distortion per-formance over the state-of-the-art methods on the Ko-dak and Tecnick datasets without the quadratic computa-tional complexity problem.
