We address the problem of estimating the poses of mul-tiple instances of the source point cloud within a target point cloud. Existing solutions require sampling a lot of hypotheses to detect possible instances and reject the out-liers, whose robustness and efﬁciency degrade notably when the number of instances and outliers increase. We propose to directly group the set of noisy correspondences into dif-ferent clusters based on a distance invariance matrix. The instances and outliers are automatically identiﬁed through clustering. Our method is robust and fast. We evaluated our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our approach can correctly register up to 20 instances with an F1 score of 90.46% in the presence of 70% outliers, which performs signiﬁcantly better and at least 10× faster than existing methods.
