Training objectsNew objects w/o occlusion w/ occlusion w/o occlusion w/ occlusionWe present a method that can recognize new objects and estimate their 3D pose in RGB images even under partial occlusions. Our method requires neither a training phase on these objects nor real images depicting them, only theirCAD models.It relies on a small set of training objects to learn local object representations, which allow us to lo-cally match the input image to a set of “templates”, ren-dered images of the CAD models for the new objects. In contrast with the state-of-the-art methods, the new objects on which our method is applied can be very different from the training objects. As a result, we are the first to show generalization without retraining on the LINEMOD andOcclusion-LINEMOD datasets. Our analysis of the failure modes of previous template-based approaches further con-firms the benefits of local features for template matching.We outperform the state-of-the-art template matching meth-ods on the LINEMOD, Occlusion-LINEMOD and T-LESS datasets.
