We introduce A100 (Aesthetic 100) to assess the aes-thetic ability of the fashion compatibility models. To date, it is the first work to address the AI model’s aesthetic ability with detailed characterization based on the profes-sional fashion domain knowledge. A100 has several de-sirable characteristics: 1. Completeness.It covers all types of standards in the fashion aesthetic system through two tests, namely LAT (Liberalism Aesthetic Test) and AAT (Academicism Aesthetic Test); 2. Reliability.It is train-ing data agnostic and consistent with major indicators. It provides a fair and objective judgment for model compari-son. 3. Explainability. Better than all previous indicators, the A100 further identifies essential characteristics of fash-ion aesthetics, thus showing the model’s performance on more fine-grained dimensions, such as Color, Balance, Ma-terial, etc. Experimental results prove the advance of theA100 in the aforementioned aspects.
