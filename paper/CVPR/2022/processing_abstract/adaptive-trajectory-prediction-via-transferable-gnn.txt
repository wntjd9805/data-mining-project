Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an essential compo-nent in a wide range of AI applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods usually assume the training and testing motions follow the same pattern while ignoring the potential distribution differences (e.g., shop-ping mall and street). This issue results in inevitable per-formance decrease. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transferable Graph Neural Network (T-GNN) frame-work, which jointly conducts trajectory prediction as well as domain alignment in a uniﬁed framework. Speciﬁcally, a domain-invariant GNN is proposed to explore the structural motion knowledge where the domain-speciﬁc knowledge is reduced. Moreover, an attention-based adaptive knowl-edge learning module is further proposed to explore ﬁne-grained individual-level feature representations for knowl-edge transfer. By this way, disparities across different tra-jectory domains will be better alleviated. More challeng-ing while practical trajectory prediction experiments are designed, and the experimental results verify the superior performance of our proposed model. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the pioneer which ﬁlls the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical pedestrian trajec-tory prediction across different domains.Source TrajectoryTarget TrajectoryFigure 1.
