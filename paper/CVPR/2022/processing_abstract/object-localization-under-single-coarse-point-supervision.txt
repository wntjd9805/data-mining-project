Point-based object localization (POL), which pursues high-performance object sensing under low-cost data an-notation, has attracted increased attention. However, the point annotation mode inevitably introduces semantic vari-ance for the inconsistency of annotated points. ExistingPOL methods heavily reply on accurate key-point annota-tions which are difficult to define. In this study, we propose a POL method using coarse point annotations, relaxing the supervision signals from accurate key points to freely spot-ted points. To this end, we propose a coarse point refine-ment (CPR) approach, which to our best knowledge is the first attempt to alleviate semantic variance from the per-spective of algorithm. CPR constructs point bags, selects semantic-correlated points, and produces semantic center points through multiple instance learning (MIL). In this way, CPR defines a weakly supervised evolution procedure, which ensures training high-performance object localizer under coarse point supervision. Experimental results onCOCO, DOTA and our proposed SeaPerson dataset vali-date the effectiveness of the CPR approach. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/ ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark/.
