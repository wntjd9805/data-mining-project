Existing state-of-the-art 3D instance segmentation meth-ods perform semantic segmentation followed by grouping.The hard predictions are made when performing semantic segmentation such that each point is associated with a sin-gle class. However, the errors stemming from hard deci-sion propagate into grouping that results in (1) low over-laps between the predicted instance with the ground truth and (2) substantial false positives. To address the afore-mentioned problems, this paper proposes a 3D instance segmentation method referred to as SoftGroup by perform-ing bottom-up soft grouping followed by top-down reﬁne-ment. SoftGroup allows each point to be associated with multiple classes to mitigate the problems stemming from se-mantic prediction errors and suppresses false positive in-stances by learning to categorize them as background. Ex-perimental results on different datasets and multiple eval-Its uation metrics demonstrate the efﬁcacy of SoftGroup. performance surpasses the strongest prior method by a sig-niﬁcant margin of +6.2% on the ScanNet v2 hidden test set and +6.8% on S3DIS Area 5 in terms of AP50. Soft-Group is also fast, running at 345ms per scan with a sin-gle Titan X on ScanNet v2 dataset.
