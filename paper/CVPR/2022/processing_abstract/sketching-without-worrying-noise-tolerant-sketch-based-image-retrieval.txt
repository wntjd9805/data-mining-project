Sketching enables many exciting applications, notably, image retrieval. The fear-to-sketch problem (i.e., “I can’t sketch”) has however proven to be fatal for its widespread adoption. This paper tackles this “fear” head on, and for the ﬁrst time, proposes an auxiliary module for existing re-trieval models that predominantly lets the users sketch with-out having to worry. We ﬁrst conducted a pilot study that revealed the secret lies in the existence of noisy strokes, but not so much of the “I can’t sketch”. We consequently design a stroke subset selector that detects noisy strokes, leaving only those which make a positive contribution towards suc-cessful retrieval. Our Reinforcement Learning based for-mulation quantiﬁes the importance of each stroke present in a given subset, based on the extent to which that stroke contributes to retrieval. When combined with pre-trained retrieval models as a pre-processing module, we achieve a signiﬁcant gain of 8%-10% over standard baselines and in turn report new state-of-the-art performance. Last but not least, we demonstrate the selector once trained, can also be used in a plug-and-play manner to empower various sketch applications in ways that were not previously possible.
