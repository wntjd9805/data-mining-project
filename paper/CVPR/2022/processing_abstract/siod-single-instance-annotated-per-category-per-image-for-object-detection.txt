Object detection under imperfect data receives great attention recently. Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) suffers from severe localization issues due to the lack of instance-level annotation, while semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) remains challenging led by the inter-image discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data.In this study, we propose the Single Instance annotated Object Detection (SIOD), requiring only one instance annotation for each existing category in an image.Degraded from inter-task (WSOD) or inter-image (SSOD) discrepancies to the intra-image discrepancy, SIOD pro-vides more reliable and rich prior knowledge for mining the rest of unlabeled instances and trades off the annota-tion cost and performance. Under the SIOD setting, we propose a simple yet effective framework, termed Dual-Mining (DMiner), which consists of a Similarity-basedPseudo Label Generating module (SPLG) and a Pixel-levelGroup Contrastive Learning module (PGCL). SPLG ﬁrstly mines latent instances from feature representation space to alleviate the annotation missing problem. To avoid being misled by inaccurate pseudo labels, we propose PGCL to boost the tolerance to false pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on MS COCO verify the feasibility of the SIOD setting and the superiority of the proposed method, which obtains consistent and signiﬁcant improvements compared to baseline methods and achieves comparable results with fully supervised object detection (FSOD) methods with only 40% instances annotated.
