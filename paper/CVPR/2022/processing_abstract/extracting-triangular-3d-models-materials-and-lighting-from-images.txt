We present an efficient method for joint optimization of topology, materials and lighting from multi-view im-age observations. Unlike recent multi-view reconstruction approaches, which typically produce entangled 3D repre-sentations encoded in neural networks, we output triangle meshes with spatially-varying materials and environment lighting that can be deployed in any traditional graphics en-gine unmodified. We leverage recent work in differentiable rendering, coordinate-based networks to compactly repre-sent volumetric texturing, alongside differentiable march-ing tetrahedrons to enable gradient-based optimization di-rectly on the surface mesh. Finally, we introduce a differ-entiable formulation of the split sum approximation of en-vironment lighting to efficiently recover all-frequency light-ing. Experiments show our extracted models used in ad-vanced scene editing, material decomposition, and high quality view interpolation, all running at interactive rates in triangle-based renderers (rasterizers and path tracers).
