Shadow removal, which aims to restore the background in the shadow regions, is challenging due to its highly ill-posed nature. Most existing deep learning-based meth-ods individually remove the shadow by only considering the content of the matched paired images, barely taking into account the auxiliary supervision of shadow genera-tion in the shadow removal procedure.In this work, we argue that shadow removal and generation are interrelat-ed and could provide useful informative supervision for each other. Speciﬁcally, we propose a new Bijective Map-ping Network (BMNet), which couples the learning proce-dures of shadow removal and shadow generation in a u-niﬁed parameter-shared framework. With consistent two-way constraints and synchronous optimization of the two procedures, BMNet could effectively recover the underlying background contents during the forward shadow removal procedure. In addition, through statistical analysis of real-world datasets, we observe and verify that shadow appear-ances under different color spectrums are inconsistent. This motivates us to design a Shadow-Invariant Color GuidanceModule (SICGM), which can explicitly utilize the learned shadow-invariant color information to guide network col-or restoration, thereby further reducing color-bias effects.Experiments on the representative ISTD, ISTD+ and SRD benchmarks show that our proposed network outperform-s the state-of-the-art method [11] in de-shadowing perfor-mance, while only using its 0.25% network parameters and 6.25% ﬂoating point operations (FLOPs).
