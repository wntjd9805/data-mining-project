Image rasterization is a mature technique in computer graphics, while image vectorization, the reverse path of rasterization, remains a major challenge.Recent ad-vanced deep learning-based models achieve vectorization and semantic interpolation of vector graphs and demon-strate a better topology of generating new figures. How-ever, deep models cannot be easily generalized to out-of-domain testing data. The generated SVGs also contain complex and redundant shapes that are not quite conve-nient for further editing. Specifically, the crucial layer-wise topology and fundamental semantics in images are stillIn this not well understood and thus not fully explored. work, we propose Layer-wise Image Vectorization, namelyLIVE, to convert raster images to SVGs and simultane-ously maintain its image topology. LIVE can generate com-pact SVG forms with layer-wise structures that are seman-tically consistent with human perspective. We progressively*Yuqian and Xingqian contributed equally. add new bÂ´ezier paths and optimize these paths with the layer-wise framework, newly designed loss functions, and component-wise path initialization technique. Our experi-ments demonstrate that LIVE presents more plausible vec-torized forms than prior works and can be generalized to new images. With the help of this newly learned topol-ogy, LIVE initiates human editable SVGs for both design-ers and other downstream applications.
