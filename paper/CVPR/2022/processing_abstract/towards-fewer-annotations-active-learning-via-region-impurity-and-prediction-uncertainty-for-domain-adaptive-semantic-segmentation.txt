Self-training has greatly facilitated domain adaptive se-mantic segmentation, which iteratively generates pseudo labels on unlabeled target data and retrains the network.However, realistic segmentation datasets are highly imbal-anced, pseudo labels are typically biased to the major-ity classes and basically noisy, leading to an error-prone and suboptimal model.In this paper, we propose a sim-ple region-based active learning approach for semantic seg-mentation under a domain shift, aiming to automatically query a small partition of image regions to be labeled while maximizing segmentation performance. Our algorithm, Re-gion Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty (RIPU), intro-duces a new acquisition strategy characterizing the spa-tial adjacency of image regions along with the prediction confidence. We show that the proposed region-based se-lection strategy makes more efficient use of a limited bud-get than image-based or point-based counterparts. Further, we enforce local prediction consistency between a pixel and its nearest neighbors on a source image. Alongside, we develop a negative learning loss to make the features more discriminative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method only requires very few annotations to al-most reach the supervised performance and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
