Online action detection is the task of predicting the ac-tion as soon as it happens in a streaming video. A major challenge is that the model does not have access to the fu-ture and has to solely rely on the history, i.e., the frames observed so far, to make predictions. It is therefore impor-tant to accentuate parts of the history that are more infor-mative to the prediction of the current frame. We presentGateHUB, Gated History Unit with Background Suppres-sion, that comprises a novel position-guided gated cross-attention mechanism to enhance or suppress parts of the history as per how informative they are for current frame prediction. GateHUB further proposes Future-augmentedHistory (FaH) to make history features more informative by using subsequently observed frames when available. In a single unified framework, GateHUB integrates the trans-former’s ability of long-range temporal modeling and the recurrent model’s capacity to selectively encode relevant information. GateHUB also introduces a background sup-pression objective to further mitigate false positive back-ground frames that closely resemble the action frames. Ex-tensive validation on three benchmark datasets, THUMOS,TVSeries, and HDD, demonstrates that GateHUB signifi-cantly outperforms all existing methods and is also more efficient than the existing best work. Furthermore, a flow-free version of GateHUB is able to achieve higher or close accuracy at 2.8× higher frame rate compared to all existing methods that require both RGB and optical flow information for prediction.
