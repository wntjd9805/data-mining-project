Few-shot image generation is a challenging task even using the state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Due to the unstable GAN training process and the limited training data, the generated images are oftenIn this work, we pro-of low quality and low diversity. pose a new “editing-based” method, i.e., Attribute GroupEditing (AGE), for few-shot image generation. The basic assumption is that any image is a collection of attributes and the editing direction for a specific attribute is shared across all categories. AGE examines the internal represen-tation learned in GANs and identifies semantically mean-ingful directions. Specifically, the class embedding, i.e., the mean vector of the latent codes from a specific category, is used to represent the category-relevant attributes, and the category-irrelevant attributes are learned globally bySparse Dictionary Learning on the difference between the sample embedding and the class embedding. Given a GAN well trained on seen categories, diverse images of unseen categories can be synthesized through editing category-irrelevant attributes while keeping category-relevant at-tributes unchanged. Without re-training the GAN, AGE is capable of not only producing more realistic and di-verse images for downstream visual applications with lim-ited data but achieving controllable image editing with in-terpretable category-irrelevant directions.
