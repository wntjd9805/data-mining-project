We present an approach to learn dense, continuous 2D-3D correspondence distributions over the surface of ob-jects from data with no prior knowledge of visual ambigu-ities like symmetry. We also present a new method for 6D pose estimation of rigid objects using the learnt distribu-tions to sample, score and refine pose hypotheses. The cor-respondence distributions are learnt with a contrastive loss, represented in object-specific latent spaces by an encoder-decoder query model and a small fully connected key model.Our method is unsupervised with respect to visual ambigu-ities, yet we show that the query- and key models learn to represent accurate multi-modal surface distributions. Our pose estimation method improves the state-of-the-art sig-nificantly on the comprehensive BOP Challenge, trained purely on synthetic data, even compared with methods trained on real data.
