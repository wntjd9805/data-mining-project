Continual learning is a longstanding research topic due to its crucial role in tackling continually arriving tasks. Up to now, the study of continual learning in computer vision is mainly restricted to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).However, recently there is a tendency that the newly emerg-ing vision transformers (ViTs) are gradually dominating the ﬁeld of computer vision, which leaves CNN-based con-tinual learning lagging behind as they can suffer from se-vere performance degradation if straightforwardly applied to ViTs. In this paper, we study ViT-backed continual learn-ing to strive for higher performance riding on recent ad-vances of ViTs. Inspired by mask-based continual learn-ing methods in CNNs, where a mask is learned per task to adapt the pre-trained ViT to the new task, we proposeMEta-ATtention (MEAT), i.e., attention to self-attention, to adapt a pre-trained ViT to new tasks without sacriﬁc-ing performance on already learned tasks. Unlike prior mask-based methods like Piggyback, where all parameters are associated with corresponding masks, MEAT leverages the characteristics of ViTs and only masks a portion of its parameters. It renders MEAT more efﬁcient and effective with less overhead and higher accuracy. Extensive experi-ments demonstrate that MEAT exhibits signiﬁcant superior-ity to its state-of-the-art CNN counterparts, with 4.0 ∼ 6.0% absolute boosts in accuracy.
