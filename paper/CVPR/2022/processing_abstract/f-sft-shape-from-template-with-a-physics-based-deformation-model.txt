Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods estimate 3D sur-face deformations from a single monocular RGB camera while assuming a 3D state known in advance (a template).This is an important yet challenging problem due to the under-constrained nature of the monocular setting. Exist-ing SfT techniques predominantly use geometric and sim-pliﬁed deformation models, which often limits their recon-struction abilities. In contrast to previous works, this paper proposes a new SfT approach explaining 2D observations through physical simulations accounting for forces and ma-terial properties. Our differentiable physics simulator reg-ularises the surface evolution and optimises the material elastic properties such as bending coefﬁcients, stretching stiffness and density. We use a differentiable renderer to minimise the dense reprojection error between the estimated 3D states and the input images and recover the deformation parameters using an adaptive gradient-based optimisation.For the evaluation, we record with an RGB-D camera chal-lenging real surfaces exposed to physical forces with var-ious material properties and textures. Our approach sig-niﬁcantly reduces the 3D reconstruction error compared to multiple competing methods. For the source code and data, see https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/phi-SfT/.
