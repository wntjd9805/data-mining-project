Sparse R-CNN is a recent strong object detection base-line by set prediction on sparse, learnable proposal boxes and proposal features. In this work, we propose to improveSparse R-CNN with two dynamic designs. First, Sparse R-CNN adopts a one-to-one label assignment scheme, where the Hungarian algorithm is applied to match only one pos-itive sample for each ground truth. Such one-to-one as-signment may not be optimal for the matching between the learned proposal boxes and ground truths. To ad-dress this problem, we propose dynamic label assignment (DLA) based on the optimal transport algorithm to assign increasing positive samples in the iterative training stages of Sparse R-CNN. We constrain the matching to be gradu-ally looser in the sequential stages as the later stage pro-duces the reﬁned proposals with improved precision. Sec-ond, the learned proposal boxes and features remain ﬁxed for different images in the inference process of Sparse R-CNN. Motivated by dynamic convolution, we propose dy-namic proposal generation (DPG) to assemble multiple pro-posal experts dynamically for providing better initial pro-posal boxes and features for the consecutive training stages.DPG thereby can derive sample-dependent proposal boxes and features for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our method, named Dynamic Sparse R-CNN, can boost the strong Sparse R-CNN baseline with different backbones for object detection. Particularly, Dynamic Sparse R-CNN reaches the state-of-the-art 47.2% AP on the COCO 2017 validation set, surpassing Sparse R-CNN by 2.2% AP with the same ResNet-50 backbone.
