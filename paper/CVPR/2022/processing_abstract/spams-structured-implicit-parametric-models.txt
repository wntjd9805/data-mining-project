Parametric 3D models have formed a fundamental role in modeling deformable objects, such as human bodies, faces, and hands; however, the construction of such para-metric models requires significant manual intervention and domain expertise. Recently, neural implicit 3D represen-tations have shown great expressibility in capturing 3D shape geometry. We observe that deformable object mo-tion is often semantically structured, and thus propose to learn Structured-implicit PArametric Models (SPAMs) as a deformable object representation that structurally decom-poses non-rigid object motion into part-based disentangled representations of shape and pose, with each being repre-sented by deep implicit functions. This enables a structured characterization of object movement, with part decomposi-tion characterizing a lower-dimensional space in which we can establish coarse motion correspondence.In particu-lar, we can leverage the part decompositions at test time to fit to new depth sequences of unobserved shapes, by estab-lishing part correspondences between the input observation and our learned part spaces; this guides a robust joint opti-mization between the shape and pose of all parts, even un-der dramatic motion sequences. Experiments demonstrate that our part-aware shape and pose understanding lead to state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction and tracking of depth sequences of complex deforming object motion.
