Layout design is ubiquitous in many applications, e.g. architecture/urban planning, etc, which involves a lengthy iterative design process. Recently, deep learning has been leveraged to automatically generate layouts via image gen-eration, showing a huge potential to free designers from la-borious routines. While automatic generation can greatly boost productivity, designer input is undoubtedly crucial.An ideal AI-aided design tool should automate repetitive routines, and meanwhile accept human guidance and pro-vide smart/proactive suggestions. However, the capabil-ity of involving humans into the loop has been largely ig-nored in existing methods which are mostly end-to-end ap-proaches. To this end, we propose a new human-in-the-loop generative model, iPLAN, which is capable of automati-cally generating layouts, but also interacting with designers throughout the whole procedure, enabling humans and AI to co-evolve a sketchy idea gradually into the final design. iPLAN is evaluated on diverse datasets and compared with existing methods. The results show that iPLAN has high fidelity in producing similar layouts to those from human designers, great flexibility in accepting designer inputs and providing design suggestions accordingly, and strong gen-eralizability when facing unseen design tasks and limited training data.
