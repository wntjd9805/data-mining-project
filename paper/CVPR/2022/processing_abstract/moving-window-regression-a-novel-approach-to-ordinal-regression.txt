First, we propose the notion of relative rank (ρ-rank), which is a new order representation scheme for input and reference instances. Second, we develop global and local relative re-gressors (ρ-regressors) to predict ρ-ranks within entire and speciﬁc rank ranges, respectively. Third, we reﬁne an ini-tial rank estimate iteratively by selecting two reference in-stances to form a search window and then estimating theρ-rank within the window. Extensive experiments results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performances on various benchmark datasets for fa-cial age estimation and historical color image classiﬁca-tion.
