Abstract
Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) aims at learning discriminative representations for person retrieval from unlabeled data. Recent techniques accomplish this task by using pseudo-labels, but these labels are inherently noisy and deteriorate the accuracy. To overcome this prob-lem, several pseudo-label refinement methods have been proposed, but they neglect the fine-grained local context es-sential for person re-ID. In this paper, we propose a novel
Part-based Pseudo Label Refinement (PPLR) framework that reduces the label noise by employing the complemen-tary relationship between global and part features. Specifi-cally, we design a cross agreement score as the similarity of k-nearest neighbors between feature spaces to exploit the reliable complementary relationship. Based on the cross agreement, we refine pseudo-labels of global features by ensembling the predictions of part features, which collec-tively alleviate the noise in global feature clustering. We further refine pseudo-labels of part features by applying la-bel smoothing according to the suitability of given labels for each part. Thanks to the reliable complementary infor-mation provided by the cross agreement score, our PPLR effectively reduces the influence of noisy labels and learns discriminative representations with rich local contexts. Ex-tensive experimental results on Market-1501 and MSMT17 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art performance.

Introduction
Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to retrieve a per-son corresponding to a given query across disjoint camera views or different time stamps [59, 69]. Thanks to the dis-criminative power of deep neural networks, supervised ap-proaches [20–22,53] have achieved impressive performance in this task. Unfortunately, they require a large amount of labeled data that demands costly annotations, limiting their practicality in large-scale real-world re-ID problems. Due to this issue, unsupervised methods that learn the discrimi-native features for person retrieval from unlabeled data have recently received much attention.
Prior works on unsupervised person re-ID have utilized pseudo-labels obtained by k-nearest neighbor search [25, 47,60] or unsupervised clustering [7,24] for training. These approaches alternate a two-stage training scheme: the label generation phase that assigns pseudo-labels and the train-ing phase that trains a model with generated labels. Among these approaches, the clustering-based methods [2, 9] have especially demonstrated their effectiveness with state-of-the-art performance. However, inherent noises in pseudo-labels significantly hinder the performance of these unsu-pervised methods.
To tackle this problem, many efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels by performing robust clustering [9, 62] or pseudo-label refinement [25, 64]. Re-cent techniques [8, 63] significantly reduce the label noise through the model ensemble in a peer-teaching manner by using predictions from an auxiliary network as refined la-bels for the target network. Nevertheless, training multi-ple backbones as teacher networks (e.g., dual ResNet in
MMT [8], and single DenseNet, ResNet, and Inception-v3 in MEB-Net [63]) requires high computational costs. Fur-thermore, labels refined by these methods consider only global features and neglect the fine-grained clues essential to person re-ID, leading to insufficient performance.
To address the aforementioned problems, we propose
Part-based Pseudo Label Refinement (PPLR), a novel unsu-pervised re-ID framework that effectively handles the label noise using part features in a self-teaching manner. Sev-eral studies [42, 67] demonstrate that the fine-grained infor-mation from part features improves the re-ID performance.
Our key idea is that this fine-grained information can pro-vide not only useful cues for better representation learning but also robustness against label noises. In contrast to the global-shape information that has large variations due to significant changes in poses and viewpoints, part features can capture the local-texture information that provides a more crucial clue to re-identifying a person [70].
We argue that the complementary relationship between
the global and part features can be used to refine the label noise in each of their feature spaces. However, some of the global and part features from the same image capture very different semantic information, and using the comple-mentary relationship na¨ıvely can result in noisy and even incorrect information. For instance, images may contain ir-relevant parts (e.g., occlusions or backgrounds) that provide unreliable complementary information, and it is desirable to exclude them from the training. Therefore, it is essential to identify whether the information of global and part features are reliable with each other to properly exploit their com-plementary relationship. To address this issue, we design a cross agreement score based on the similarity between the k-nearest neighbors of global and part features. Based on the cross agreement, we propose two pseudo-label refine-ment methods – part-guided label refinement (PGLR) and agreement-aware label smoothing (AALS). PGLR refines the pseudo-labels of global features by aggregating the pre-dictions of part features, guiding the global features to learn from rich local contexts. AALS refines the pseudo-labels of part features by smoothing the label distributions, thus calibrating the predictions of part features.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We propose a part-based pseudo-label refinement framework that operates in a self-ensemble manner without auxiliary networks. To the best of our knowl-edge, this is the first work to handle the label noise using the part feature information for person re-ID.
• We design a cross agreement score to capture reli-able complementary information, which is computed by the similarity between the k-nearest neighbors of the global and part features.
• Extensive experimental results with superior perfor-mance against the state-of-the-art methods demon-strate the effectiveness of the proposed method. 2.
