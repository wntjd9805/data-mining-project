Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new query-based detec-tion framework for crowd detection. Previous query-based detectors suffer from two drawbacks: first, multiple pre-dictions will be inferred for a single object, typically in crowded scenes; second, the performance saturates as the depth of the decoding stage increases. Benefiting from the nature of the one-to-one label assignment rule, we propose a progressive predicting method to address the above is-sues. Specifically, we first select accepted queries prone to generate true positive predictions, then refine the rest noisy queries according to the previously accepted pre-dictions. Experiments show that our method can signifi-cantly boost the performance of query-based detectors in crowded scenes. Equipped with our approach, Sparse
RCNN achieves 92.0% AP, 41.4% MR−2 and 83.2% JI on the challenging CrowdHuman [35] dataset, outperforming the box-based method MIP [8] that specifies in handling crowded scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method, robust to crowdedness, can still obtain consistent improvements on moderately and slightly crowded datasets like CityPer-sons [47] and COCO [26]. Code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/megvii-model/Iter-E2EDET. 1.

Introduction
Crowded object detection is a practical yet challeng-ing research field in computer vision. Many research ef-forts have been made and achieved impressive progress
[28, 5, 6, 46, 49, 8, 33, 14, 23] in the last few decades. How-ever, most of them [28, 5, 6, 46, 49, 8, 33, 14] require hand-craft components, e.g. anchor settings and post-processing, resulted in sub-optimal performance in handling scenes.

Following DETR [3], Sparse RCNN [37] ensures object queries interact with local feature of Region of In-terest (RoI), while deformable DETR [52] proposes atten-tion modules that only attend to a small set of key sam-pling points. They further improve the detection accuracy and mitigate several issues occurred in DETR: slow conver-gence and high computational overhead. decoding stage.
The above success inspires us to study query-based ob-ject detection methods in crowded scenes, aiming at de-signing a more sophisticated end-to-end detection frame-work. Although these query-based approaches [18, 52] can obtain significant results on the slightly crowded datasets like COCO [26], our initial studies show they suffer from several unresolved challenges in crowded scenes:(1). the query-based detector tends to infer multiple predictions for a single object, with false positives introduced. Figure. 1a shows a common failure case; (2). The performance of a query-based detector becomes saturated or even worse as the depth of decoding stage increases, which is depicted in the Appendix.
Our motivations. Further investigations on the query-based method, Sparse RCNN [37], yield the following in-triguing findings in crowd scenes. As described in Fig-ure. 2a, a large percentage of target objects can be accu-rately predicted by those predictions with high confidence scores (e.g. higher than a threshold of 0.7), while contain-ing few false positives. These predictions are more likely to be true positives that can be taken as accepted predictions.
While the rest, where a considerable number of true posi-tives and false positives exist, can be regarded as noisy pre-dictions. Naturally, if an object is detected by one accepted prediction, there is no need for noisy predictions to detect it again. Hence, Why not strengthen the discrimination of those noisy predictions given the context of the accepted predictions? To this end, the noisy queries can ‘perceive’ whether their targets have been detected or not. If so, their confidence scores will be reduced and then filtered out.
Our contributions Motivated by this, we propose a pro-gressive prediction method equipped with a prediction se-lector, relation information extractor, query updater, and la-bel assignment to improve the performance of query-based object detectors in handling crowded scenes.
First, we develop a prediction selector to select queries associated with high confidence scores as accepted queries, leaving the rest as noisy queries. Then, to let the noisy queries ‘perceive’ whether their targets have been detected or not, we design a relation extractor for relation modeling between noisy queries and their accepted neighbors. Fur-ther, a query updater is developed by performing a new local self-attention attending to spatially-related neighbors only. Finally, a new one-to-one label assignment rule is in-troduced to assign samples among the accepted and refined noisy queries step by step. With the proposed method, the above problems can be well addressed: (1). Each object can be detected only once, which greatly decreases the number of false positives while increasing the number of true pos-itives, as described in Figure. 1b; (2). As depicted in Fig-ure. 2b, the performance is consistently improved compared with its counterparts [37, 52] that have the same depth of
Our method is generic and can be incorporated into mul-tiple architectures [37, 52], and delivers significant perfor-mance improvements of query-based detectors. Equipped with our approach, Sparse RCNN [37] with ResNet-50 [16] backbone obtains 92.0% AP, 41.4% MR−2 and 83.2% JI on the challenging dataset CrowdHuman [35], outperform-ing the box-based method MIP [8]. Besides, deformable
DETR [52], equipped with our approach, also achieves 92.1% AP and 84.0% JI. Moreover, our approach works reasonably well for less crowded scenes, e.g. the Sparse
RCNN with our approach can still obtain 1.0% MR−2 and 1.1% AP gains on moderately and slightly crowded datasets
