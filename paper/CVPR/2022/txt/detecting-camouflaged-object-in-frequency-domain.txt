Abstract
Camouﬂaged object detection (COD) aims to identify objects that are perfectly embedded in their environment, which has various downstream applications in ﬁelds such as medicine, art, and agriculture. However, it is an ex-tremely challenging task to spot camouﬂaged objects with the perception ability of human eyes. Hence, we claim that the goal of COD task is not just to mimic the human visual ability in a single RGB domain, but to go beyond the human biological vision. We then introduce the frequency domain as an additional clue to better detect camouﬂaged objects from backgrounds. To well involve the frequency clues into the CNN models, we present a powerful network with two special components. We ﬁrst design a novel frequency en-hancement module (FEM) to dig clues of camouﬂaged ob-jects in the frequency domain. It contains the ofﬂine discrete cosine transform followed by the learnable enhancement.
Then we use a feature alignment to fuse the features from
RGB domain and frequency domain. Moreover, to further make full use of the frequency information, we propose the high-order relation module (HOR) to handle the rich fusion feature. Comprehensive experiments on three widely-used
COD datasets show the proposed method signiﬁcantly out-performs other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. 1.

Introduction
With the goal of detecting and segmenting the objects that are perfectly embedded in the environment, camou-ﬂaged object detection (COD) has become prevalent in the computer vision community [9, 17, 59]. As a preliminary step, COD plays an essential role in various visual systems, such as polyp segmentation [10], lung infection segmenta-tion [11], and recreational art [3].

Traditional methods [17, 37, 41] detect camouﬂaged ob-jects by utilizing handcrafted low-level features, thus these methods often fail in complex scenes. Recently, with the application of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), the CNN-based methods have pushed the performance of
COD to a new level. Some methods [8, 40] make attempts at designing texture enhanced module or adopting attention mechanisms to guide the models to focus on camouﬂaged regions. Methods try to locate camouﬂaged objects accu-rately with the help of extra edge information [59]. In [33], new supervision data is introduced for segmenting the cam-ouﬂaged objects. Recent works [35] try to treat segmenting camouﬂaged objects as a two-stage process. Abandoning these sophisticated techniques, we simply use U-Net like networks with Res2Net [13] and ResNet50 [16] backbones,
and frequency domains. Moreover, we propose a novel fre-quency loss to directly constrain in frequency and guide the network to focus more on the frequency signals. As can be seen in Figure 1(a), “red box” means target object and
“green box” denotes background. The target object is cryp-tic in the background.
In RGB domain, the target object is hard to see. However, in frequency domain Figure 1(c), information that can help distinguish target object and back-ground is captured. When there are noise objects in the im-age, they may be extracted together with the camouﬂaged objects.
In order to distinguish the real camouﬂaged ob-jects, we propose the high-order relation module (HOR).
As the target and noise objects always share similar struc-tural information, a low-order relation is not sufﬁcient for obtaining the discriminative features.
The main contributions are summarized as follows:
• To our best knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to claim COD task should go beyond RGB domain and introduce fre-quency clues to better detecting camouﬂaged objects.
• We present a powerful network for COD task with en-hanced frequency clues. And we design a Frequency
Enhancement Module (FEM) with a frequency percep-tual loss and a high-order relation module (HOR) to better leverage the information in frequency domain for dense prediction task.
• Comprehensive experiments on three widely-used
COD datasets (CHAMELEON, CAMO-Test and
COD10-Test) show that the proposed method outper-forms other state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. 2.
