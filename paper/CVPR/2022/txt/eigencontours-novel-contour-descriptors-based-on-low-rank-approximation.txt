Abstract
Novel contour descriptors, called eigencontours, based on low-rank approximation are proposed in this paper.
First, we construct a contour matrix containing all object boundaries in a training set. Second, we decompose the contour matrix into eigencontours via the best rank-M ap-proximation. Third, we represent an object boundary by a linear combination of the M eigencontours. We also in-corporate the eigencontours into an instance segmentation framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the pro-posed eigencontours can represent object boundaries more effectively and more efﬁciently than existing descriptors in a low-dimensional space. Furthermore, the proposed algo-rithm yields meaningful performances on instance segmen-tation datasets. 1.

Introduction
Contour is one of the most important object descriptors, along with texture and color. The boundary of an object in an image is encoded in contour description, which is useful in various applications, such as image retrieval [4, 31, 32], recognition [17,25,29], and segmentation [16,19,27,28,34].
It is desirable to represent object boundaries compactly, as well as faithfully, but it is challenging to design such con-tour descriptors due to the diversity and complexity of ob-ject shapes.
Early contour descriptors were developed mainly for im-age retrieval [4,17,31,32]. An object contour can be simply represented based on the area, circularity, and/or eccentric-ity of the object [30]. For more precise description, there are several approaches, including shape signature [6,18,27], structural analysis [5, 7, 10, 21, 28], spectral analysis [4, 31], and curvature scale space (CSS) [8, 17].
Recently, contour descriptors have been incorporated tracking, and into deep-learning-based object detection, segmentation systems. In [35], bounding boxes are replaced by polygons to enclose objects more tightly.
In [3], el-lipse ﬁtting is done to produce a rotated box of a target object to be tracked. For instance segmentation, contour-(cid:1821)(cid:2869) (cid:1821)(cid:2870) (cid:1821)(cid:2871) (cid:1821)(cid:2872)

Illustration of the eigencontour representation. The
Figure 1. boundary of a vehicle is represented by a linear combination of four eigencontours: u1, u2, u3 and u4. First, u1 approximates the object boundary roughly. Next, u2 is used to reﬁne the boundary by adjusting top and bottom parts, as well as front and rear ones.
To reconstruct more complex parts, such as wheels and bumper, u3 and u4 should be used as well. These eigencontours were de-termined by analyzing the boundaries of all objects in the ‘car’ category in the KINS dataset [22]. based techniques have been proposed that represent pixel-wise masks by contour descriptors based on shape signa-ture [27] or polynomial ﬁtting [28]. Even though these de-scriptors can localize an object effectively, they may fail to reconstruct the object boundary faithfully. Also, they con-sider the structural information of an individual object only, without exploiting the shape correlation between different objects.
In this paper, we propose novel contour descriptors, called eigencontours, based on low-rank approximation.
First, we construct a contour matrix containing all object boundaries in a training set. Second, we decompose the contour matrix into eigencontours, based on the best rank-M approximation of singular value decomposition (SVD)
[2]. Then, each contour is represented by a linear combina-tion of the M eigencontours, as illustrated in Figure 1. Also, we incorporate the eigencontours into an instance segmen-tation framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed eigencontours can represent object boundaries more effectively and more efﬁciently than the existing con-tour descriptors [27, 28]. Moreover, utilizing the existing
framework of YOLOv3 [23], the proposed algorithm yields promising instance segmentation performances on various datasets — KINS [22], SBD [12], and COCO2017 [15].
This work has the following contributions:
• We propose the notion of eigencontours — data-driven contour descriptors based on SVD — to represent ob-ject boundaries as faithfully as possible with a limited number of coefﬁcients.
• The proposed algorithm can represent object bound-aries more effectively and more efﬁciently than the ex-isting contour descriptors.
• The proposed algorithm outperforms conventional contour-based techniques in instance segmentation. 2.
