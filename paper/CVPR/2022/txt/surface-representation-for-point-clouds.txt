We ex-plore two variants of RepSurf, Triangular RepSurf and Um-brella RepSurf inspired by triangle meshes and umbrella curvature in computer graphics. We compute the represen-tations of RepSurf by predefined geometric priors after sur-face reconstruction.

Based on a simple baseline of PointNet++ (SSG version), Umbrella RepSurf surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin for classifi-cation, segmentation and detection on various benchmarks in terms of performance and efficiency. With an increase of around 0.008M number of parameters, 0.04G FLOPs, and 1.12ms inference time, our method achieves 94.7% (+0.5%) on ModelNet40, and 84.6% (+1.8%) on ScanObjectNN for classification, while 74.3% (+0.8%) mIoU on S3DIS 6-fold, and 70.0% (+1.6%) mIoU on ScanNet for segmentation.

Introduction
Learning from raw point clouds has drawn considerable attention for its advantages in various applications, like au-tonomous driving, augmented reality, and robotics. How-ever, it can be difficult for the irregularity of point clouds.
To handle irregular points, the pioneering work Point-Net [41] adopts point-wise multi-layer perceptrons (MLP)

Given one point (blue) in the airplane point cloud, we indicate its global position by the coordinate xi. Different from the prior works, we further explicitly describe its local geometry through
Triangular RepSurf ti extracted from the reconstructed triangle or
Umbrella RepSurf ui learned from the reconstructed umbrella sur-face. By combining positional and geometric information, point representation can be more expressive. After concatenating xi and ti/ui as input, we predict the category of the point cloud via MLPs followed by a pooling operation. to learn from points independently and utilizes a symmetric function to obtain the global information. PointNet++ [43] further introduces set abstraction (SA) to capture the local information of point clouds. However, both methods learn from standalone points and take no notice of local shape awareness [31].
Local shapes are vital for the learning of point clouds.
To learn from the local structural information, some prior works learn from grids [25,53], relations [31,44], or graphs
[58, 65]. However, these methods learn from shapes indi-rectly by attaching more ingredients (like Euclidean dis-tances, attention mechanism) or applying various transfor-mations (like graph construction, voxelization). These may lead to complex preprocessing and significant computa-tions. These sophisticated hand-crafted components learn from implicit local shape representations in general. We ar-gue that it may lead to an omission of information when pre-defining the ingredients, or a loss of geometry during transformation.
Taylor Series [52] expresses a local curve by derivatives.
We simplify it by considering the second derivative only.
Thus, we can roughly represent the local curve, or what we call the “surface” in 3D point clouds, by its corresponding tangent.
To this end, inspired by Taylor Series, we propose Rep-Surf (representative surfaces) to explicitly represent the lo-cal shape of point clouds (shown in Fig. 1). To complement
Cartesian coordinates in a point set with geometric informa-tion, we define RepSurf with three properties: discreteness, explicit locality, and curvature sensitivity. These properties allow RepSurf to express local geometry in free collabo-ration with irregular points. For a simple version of Rep-Surf, we propose Triangular RepSurf inspired by triangle meshes in computer graphics. We reconstruct a triangle for each point by querying its two neighbors and compute the triangle feature (i.e., normal vector, surface position, nor-malized coordinate) as RepSurf. To enlarge the perceptive field of RepSurf, we further propose Umbrella RepSurf in-spired by umbrella curvature [10]. Umbrella RepSurf can be an extension of Triangular RepSurf since it is computed from the triangles of an umbrella surface. Different from
Triangular RepSurf, we reconstruct an umbrella surface af-ter searching K nearest neighbors and sorting the neigh-bors counterclockwise. For expressive representations, we feed the K triangular features of an umbrella surface into a learnable transformation function followed by aggrega-tion. Moreover, we present several delicate designs (i.e., po-lar auxiliary, channel de-differentiation) to further improve
RepSurf.
Our key contributions are manifold:
• A novel triangle-based representation, Triangular Rep-Surf for point clouds.
• A novel multi-surface representation, Umbrella Rep-Surf for point clouds.
• A high-efficiency plug-and-play module based on Rep-Surf for point cloud models.
• Our method achieves state-of-the-art on numerous point cloud benchmarks. 2.
