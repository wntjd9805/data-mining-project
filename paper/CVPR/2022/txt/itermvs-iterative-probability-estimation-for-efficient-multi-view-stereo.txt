Introduction
Multi-view stereo (MVS) describes the technology to reconstruct dense 3D models of observed scenes from a set of calibrated images. MVS is a fundamental prob-lem of geometric computer vision and a core technique for applications like augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving and robotics. Albeit being studied extensively for decades, the conditions that occur in real-world applica-tion scenarios pose problems such as occlusion, illumina-tion changes, low-textured areas and non-Lambertian sur-faces [1, 18, 33, 50] that remain unsolved up to now.
Traditional methods [9, 10, 32, 42] suffer from hand-crafted modeling and matching metrics and struggle under those challenging conditions. In comparison, recent data-driven approaches [11, 40, 48, 49, 51] based on Convolu-tional Neural Networks (CNN) demonstrate a signiﬁcantly improved performance on various MVS benchmarks [1,18].
A popular representative, MVSNet [48], constructs a 3D cost volume that is regularized with a 3D CNN and regresses the depth map from the probability volume.
While this methodology achieves impressive performance on benchmarks, it does not scale up well to high-resolution

However, low run-time and power consumption are the key in most industrial appli-cations and resource friendly methodologies become more important. Aiming to improve the efﬁciency, recent vari-ants of MVSNet [48] are proposed, which can be mainly divided into two categories: recurrent methods [46, 49] and multi-stage methods [6, 11, 40, 47]. Several recurrent meth-ods [46, 49] can relax the memory consumption by regu-larizing the cost volume sequentially with GRU [7] or con-volutional LSTM [41], however, at the cost of an increase in run-time.
In contrast, multi-stage methods [6, 11, 47] utilize cascade cost volumes and estimate the depth map from coarse to ﬁne. While this approach can lead to high efﬁciency in both memory and run-time, a reduced search
range at ﬁner stages implies a limitation in recovering from errors induced at coarse resolutions [35].
A current method that unites a competitive performance with highest efﬁciency in memory and run-time among all learning-based methods is PatchmatchNet [40]. Based on traditional PatchMatch [3, 10], PatchmatchNet combines learned adaptive propagation and evaluation modules with a cascaded structure. While sharing the common limitation of coarse-to-ﬁne methods, the generalization ability of Patch-matchNet appears limited when compared to other multi-stage methods [6, 11, 47].
In this work, we propose IterMVS, a novel GRU-based iterative method aimed at further improving efﬁciency as well as performance for high-resolution MVS.
Contributions: (i) We propose a novel and lightweight
GRU-based probability estimator that encodes the per-pixel probability distribution of depth in its hidden state. This compressed representation does not require to keep the probability volume in memory the whole time. In each it-eration, multi-scale matching information is injected to up-date the pixel-wise depth distribution. Compared to coarse-to-ﬁne methods, the GRU-based probability estimator al-ways operates at the same resolution, utilizes a large search range and keeps track of the distribution over the full depth range. (ii) We propose a simple, yet effective depth esti-mation strategy that combines both classiﬁcation and re-gression, which is robust to multi-modal distributions but (iii) We verify the ef-also achieves sub-pixel precision. fectiveness of our method on various MVS datasets, e.g.
DTU [1], Tanks & Temples [18] and ETH3D [33]. The results demonstrate that IterMVS achieves very competi-tive performance, while showing highest efﬁciency in both memory and run-time among all the learning-based meth-ods, Fig. 1. Compared with PatchmatchNet [40], IterMVS is more efﬁcient in both memory and run-time, achieves comparable performance on DTU [1] and demonstrates much better generalization ability on Tanks & Temples [18] and ETH3D [33]. 2.
