Conditional image repainting (CIR) is an advanced im-age editing task, which requires the model to generate vi-sual content in user-speciﬁed regions conditioned on mul-tiple cross-modality constraints, and composite the visual content with the provided background seamlessly. Existing methods based on two-phase architecture design assume dependency between phases and cause color-image incon-gruity. To solve these problems, we propose a novel Uniﬁed
Conditional image Repainting Network (UniCoRN). We break the two-phase assumption in the CIR task by con-structing the interaction and dependency relationship be-tween background and other conditions. We further intro-duce the hierarchical structure into cross-modality similar-ity model to capture feature patterns at different levels and bridge the gap between visual content and color condition.
A new LANDSCAPE-CIR dataset is collected and annotated to expand the application scenarios of the CIR task. Exper-iments show that UniCoRN achieves higher synthetic qual-ity, better condition consistency, and more realistic com-positing effect. 1.

Introduction
Advanced image editing is desired in various applica-tions such as colorizing old photos [8, 19, 42, 43], repair-ing damaged regions [23, 35, 37, 38], blending multiple im-ages [25, 34, 41], and so on. With rapid progress in improv-ing generative networks, skill barriers of using image edit-ing tools have been lowered. For example, users can trans-form any photo into the style of a “famous painter” simply by providing one of his own works [14].
To “free” the users from requiring professional skills while maintaining the “freedom” to realize their ideas for editing an image, conditional image repainting (CIR) (cid:481) (cid:4667) (cid:883) (cid:882) (cid:4666) (cid:1840) (cid:817) (cid:1878) e g n a r o d n a
