Introduction
The estimation of the relative pose of two camera views is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Kneip et al. proposed to solve this problem by introducing the normal epipolar constraint (NEC). However, their approach does not take into account uncertainties, so that the accuracy of the estimated relative pose is highly dependent on ac-curate feature positions in the target frame. In this work, we introduce the probabilistic normal epipolar constraint (PNEC) that overcomes this limitation by accounting for anisotropic and inhomogeneous uncertainties in the feature positions. To this end, we propose a novel objective func-tion, along with an efﬁcient optimization scheme that effec-tively minimizes our objective while maintaining real-time performance. In experiments on synthetic data, we demon-strate that the novel PNEC yields more accurate rotation estimates than the original NEC and several popular rela-tive rotation estimation algorithms. Furthermore, we inte-grate the proposed method into a state-of-the-art monocu-lar rotation-only odometry system and achieve consistently improved results for the real-world KITTI dataset.

Extracting the 3D geometry of a scene from images is a long-standing problem in computer vision and has numer-ous applications, including augmented and virtual reality, autonomous driving, or robots that can help with everyday life. One key component of many such approaches is the estimation of the relative pose between two viewpoints of a scene. For example, relative pose estimation is the founda-tion of geometric vision algorithms like structure from mo-tion (SfM) or visual odometry (VO). Global SfM pipelines rely on accurate pairwise relative poses for use as ﬁxed mea-surements in global motion averaging [23, 48]. In VO, rel-ative pose estimation is used to construct a trajectory from a stream of images. Like for all odometry systems, small errors in the relative pose estimation lead to a drift in VO.
The most widely used concept for relative pose estima-tion is the essential matrix [43] in the calibrated case, or the fundamental matrix [25] in the general case. Respec-tive approaches rely on correspondences between feature points, and are generally known to provide fast and accu-rate results [24]. However, approaches based on the essen-tial matrix suffer from fundamental problems, with the most prominent being solution multiplicity [17, 25] and planar degeneracy [33]. To address such issues, often it is nec-essary to consider more involved solution strategies, which also lead to even more accurate relative poses as shown by
Kneip et al. [33] and in this work.
To this end, Kneip et al. [34] proposed a constraint that avoids these problems. Their epipolar plane normal copla-narity constraint (in later works just normal epipolar con-straint, NEC) allows the estimation of the rotation inde-pendent of the translation. A later work by Kneip and Ly-nen [33] provides a fast and reliable eigenvalue-based solver for the NEC, which allows for real-time relative pose esti-mation. This approach has been incorporated into rotation-only VO systems that estimate the rotation independent of the translation and has led to promising results [9, 39].
Yet, like many VO systems, neither of them considers the quality of the correspondences. After removing outliers from the feature matches, every match contributes equally to the ﬁnal result. However, two-dimensional feature corre-spondences exhibit different error distributions depending on the content of the image and the speciﬁc method used to extract the correspondences, which can be seen in Fig. 2.
A correspondence lying on an edge is accurately localized perpendicular to the edge and possesses higher position un-certainty parallel to it. This ﬁne-grained information about the quality of the matches is completely ignored. It has been shown that considering the uncertainty is beneﬁcial for fun-damental matrix estimation [5]. While Kanazawa et al. [30] argue that the uncertainty needs to be sufﬁciently inhomo-geneous to see the aforementioned beneﬁt, our experiments show that the PNEC improves over the NEC even for ho-mogeneous uncertainty due to the geometry of the problem.
The main objective of our work is to improve the ac-curacy of rotation estimation techniques. We achieve this based on the following technical contributions:
• We introduce the novel probabilistic normal epipolar con-straint (PNEC), see Fig. 1, which for the ﬁrst time makes it possible to incorporate uncertainty information into the normal epipolar constraint (NEC).
• We propose an efﬁcient two-stage optimization strategy for the PNEC that achieves real-time performance.
• We analyse singularities in the PNEC energy function and address them with a simple regularization scheme.
• Experimentally, we compare our PNEC to several popu-lar relative pose estimation algorithms, namely 8pt [24], 7pt [25], Stewenius 5pt [56], Nist´er 5pt [51], and
NEC [33], and demonstrate that our PNEC delivers more accurate rotation estimates. Moreover, we integrate our
PNEC into a visual odometry system and achieve state-of-the-art results on real-world data.
• We publish the code for all experiments to facilitate future research. 2.
