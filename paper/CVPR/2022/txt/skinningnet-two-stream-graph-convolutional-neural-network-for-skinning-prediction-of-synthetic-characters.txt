Abstract
This work presents SkinningNet, an end-to-end Two-Stream Graph Neural Network architecture that computes skinning weights from an input mesh and its associated skeleton, without making any assumptions on shape class and structure of the provided mesh. Whereas previous meth-ods pre-compute handcrafted features that relate the mesh and the skeleton or assume a fixed topology of the skeleton, the proposed method extracts this information in an end-to-end learnable fashion by jointly learning the best rela-tionship between mesh vertices and skeleton joints. The proposed method exploits the benefits of the novel Multi-Aggregator Graph Convolution that combines the results of different aggregators during the summarizing step of the
Message-Passing scheme, helping the operation to general-ize for unseen topologies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the contributions of our novel architec-ture, with SkinningNet outperforming current state-of-the-art alternatives. 1.

Introduction
Animating a 3D character is a complex and time-consuming process that animators spend years learning to do efficiently. In a typical animation pipeline, an artist first creates a mesh model and specifies the skeleton topology, skinning weights are then painted manually. During this process, the animators follow two main steps. First, they do the skin binding, which consists of defining which parts of the mesh will be affected by the movement of a specific joint. Finally, they decide the skinning weights that describe which amount of movement is transferred to the skin.
SkinningNet is a Two-Stream Graph Convolutional Net-work that, given an input mesh and its corresponding skele-ton, performs the skin binding and then computes the skin-ning weights for each mesh vertex as it can be seen in Fig. 1.
Previous methods rely on pre-computed handcrafted fea-Figure 1. Overview of the proposed pipeline. Given an input mesh and its associated skeleton, SkinningNet predicts the skin-ning weights used by the Linear Blend Skinning [26] algorithm to create a set of animations. tures to create the mesh and skeleton relationship. The proposed method automatically extracts the best features to relate the mesh and the skeleton to predict the associ-ated skinning weights. The main contributions of this paper are: a) A Two-Stream Graph Neural architecture that learns to extract features from meshes and skeletons with differ-ent topologies, b) A Multi-aggregator Graph Convolution (MAGC) layer that extends the Message-Passing scheme to use a multiple aggregation approach that better gener-alizes for unseen graph topologies, c) A novel skin bind-ing method that uses a skeleton joint representation instead of a bone representation and d) A Mesh-Skeleton Graph
Convolution Network that exploits this skeleton joint rep-resentation to find the optimal relationship between the in-put mesh and the skeleton. All these contributions allow the proposed method to outperform current state-of-the-art with over 20% improvement on mesh deformation error. Further-more, experimental results show the ability of the proposed method to generalize for complex mesh and skeleton struc-tures of different domains. 2.
