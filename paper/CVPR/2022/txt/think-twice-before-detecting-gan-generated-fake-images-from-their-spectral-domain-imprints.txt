Abstract
Accurate detection of the fake but photorealistic images is one of the most challenging tasks to address social, bio-metrics security and privacy related concerns in our com-munity. Earlier research has underlined the existence of spectral domain artifacts in fake images generated by pow-erful generative adversarial network (GAN) based meth-ods. Therefore, a number of highly accurate frequency do-main methods to detect such GAN generated images have been proposed in the literature. Our study in this paper in-troduces a pipeline to mitigate the spectral artifacts. We show from our experiments that the artifacts in frequency spectrum of such fake images can be mitigated by proposed methods, which leads to the sharp decrease of performance of spectrum-based detectors. This paper also presents ex-perimental results using a large database of images that are synthesized using BigGAN, CRN, CycleGAN, IMLE, Pro-GAN, StarGAN, StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 (including syn-thesized high resolution fingerprint images) to illustrate ef-fectiveness of the proposed methods. Furthermore, we se-lect a spatial-domain based fake image detector and ob-serve a notable decrease in the detection performance when proposed method is incorporated. In summary, our insight-ful analysis and pipeline presented in this paper cautions the forensic community on the reliability of GAN-generated fake image detectors that are based on the analysis of fre-quency artifacts as these artifacts can be easily mitigated. 1.

Introduction
GAN-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art perfor-mance for several computer vision related tasks. They have shown great ability to generate images which do not exist in the real world [8, 32, 38], transfer the style of images
[14, 25, 42] and translate text to image [16, 39]. Consider-ing the latent risk associated with the misuse of these fake but real-looklike images, several methods have been pro-posed to detect such GAN-generated images. Spatial do-main methods [36, 40, 41, 44] that directly train large neu-ral network-based detectors have shown to perform well.
More recently such fake image detectors based on the arti-facts in frequency spectrum of GAN-generated images have been proposed. These detectors require less parameters as compared with the spatial-domain based detectors, and have shown better performance.

GAN-generated images show good performance in recent works.
However, these detectors can be compromised when the GAN-generated images are further subjected to our proposed methods.
The main reason for the success of these methods is that the anomalies in the frequency domain representation of
GAN-generated images are more pronounced and therefore easy to detect. These anomalies in the spectrum of GAN-generated images can be categorized into two types: abnor-mal spectral patterns and discrepancy in their power distri-bution. Some abnormal patterns such as dots and lines are more frequent in the spectra of images generated by Cy-cleGAN [47], StarGAN [13], and StyleGAN [27]. In fre-quency spectra of BigGAN [10] generated images, cloud-like blurry regions in high-frequency part of spectra are more likely to be observed. In the spectra of synthetic im-ages generated by CRN [12], IMLE [31], ProGAN [26] and
StyleGAN2 [28], the artifact patterns have been observed in distinguishing latent shapes. Zhang et al. [45] use spec-spectrum using Algorithm 1. The spectrum-based fake im-age detectors, which can also be regarded as the black box models, are still easy to attack. Fig. 1 shows an illustration of the proposed method to generate more effective fake im-age (Fake+) that can compromise the spectrum-based fake image detectors. 1.1. Contributions
The contributions of our work can be summarized as fol-lows:
• We investigate the mainstream fake image detec-tors and observe that these spectrum-based detectors mainly rely on the abnormal patterns and power dis-crepancy of artifacts in their spectra to detect the fake images. Therefore two methods are proposed to mit-igate the intensity of artifact patterns in spectra of
GAN-generated images, and one method is proposed to correct power discrepancy.
• By incorporating artifact-mitigating strategy followed by the power discrepancy correction, the performance from spectrum-based detectors significantly reduces.
It can prove that the spectrum-based detectors are not robust to handle malicious operations on spectra of the fake images. This finding is also significant for the im-age forensic community. It cautions for their reliance on the spectrum-based fake image detection.
• We also present experimental results to evaluate the ac-curacy of a spatial domain based detector on the GAN-generated images that are enhanced by proposed meth-ods. Despite performance degradation, such spatial domain based detector is still robust to detect fake im-ages. 1.2.
