Accelerated by telemedicine, advances in Remote Pho-toplethysmography (rPPG) are beginning to offer a viable path toward non-contact physiological measurement. Un-fortunately, the datasets for rPPG are limited as they re-quire videos of the human face paired with ground-truth, synchronized heart rate data from a medical-grade health monitor. Also troubling is that the datasets are not inclusive of diverse populations, i.e., current real rPPG facial video datasets are imbalanced in terms of races or skin tones, leading to accuracy disparities on different demographic groups. This paper proposes a scalable biophysical learn-ing based method to generate physio-realistic synthetic rPPG videos given any reference image and target rPPG signal and shows that it could further improve the state-of-the-art physiological measurement and reduce the bias among different groups. We also collect the largest rPPG dataset of its kind (UCLA-rPPG) with a diverse presence of subject skin tones, in the hope that this could serve as a benchmark dataset for different skin tones in this area and ensure that advances of the technique can benefit all people for healthcare equity.

Introduction
Photoplethysmography (PPG) is an optical technique that measures vital signs such as Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) by detecting the light reflected or transmitted through the skin. Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) based on camera videos has several advantages over the conventional PPG methods.
It is non-contact thus allow-ing for a wide range of applications in e.g. neonatal mon-It causes no skin irratation and prevents itoring [15, 41].

Table 1. Comparison of rPPG real datasets and our proposed synthetic dataset. Real datasets are limited by the number of subjects and videos and demographic diversity, while synthetic datasets have easy control of these attributes. the risk of developing into infection for those whose skins are fragile and sensitive to the adhesive sensing electrodes.
As cameras are ubiquitous in electronic device nowadays (such as smartphones, laptops), rPPG can be applied for telemedicine with patients at home and no equipment set-up is needed [1]. Camera-based rPPG techniques have also been used in other applications such as driver moni-toring [30] and face anti-spoofing [19].
Traditional rPPG methods either use Blind Source Sep-aration (BSS) [17, 36, 37] or models based on skin re-flectance [9, 16, 43] to separate out the pulse signal from the color changes on the face. These methods usually re-quire pre-processing such as face tracking, registration and skin segmentation. More recently, deep learning and con-volutional neural networks (CNN) have been more popular due to its expressiveness and flexibility [7,20,21,27,28,44].
CNNs learn the mapping between the pulse signal and the color variations with end-to-end supervised training on the labeled dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art performance on the vital sign detection. However, the performance of data-driven rPPG networks hinges on the quality of the dataset [31].
There are some efforts (as shown in Tab. 1) on collect-lized to improve the performance of the state-of-the-art deep rPPG methods. Notably, the corresponding rendering model can also be deployed to generate data for underrepresented groups, which provides an effec-tive method to further mitigate the demographic bias in rPPG frameworks.
• To facilitate the rPPG research, we release a real rPPG dataset called UCLA-rPPG that contains diverse skin tones. This dataset can be used to benchmark per-formance across different demographic groups in this area. 2.
