Introduction
Reference-based super-resolution(RefSR) has achieved impressive progress on the recovery of high-frequency de-tails thanks to an additional reference high-resolution(HR) image input.
Although the superiority compared with
Single-Image Super-Resolution(SISR), existing RefSR meth-ods easily result in the reference-underuse issue and the reference-misuse as shown in Fig.1. In this work, we deeply investigate the cause of the two issues and further propose a novel framework to mitigate them. Our studies ﬁnd that the issues are mostly due to the improper coupled frame-work design of current methods. Those methods conduct the super-resolution task of the input low-resolution(LR) im-age and the texture transfer task from the reference image together in one module, easily introducing the interference between LR and reference features. Inspired by this ﬁnding, we propose a novel framework, which decouples the two tasks of RefSR, eliminating the interference between the LR image and the reference image. The super-resolution task upsamples the LR image leveraging only the LR image itself.
The texture transfer task extracts and transfers abundant textures from the reference image to the coarsely upsam-pled result of the super-resolution task. Extensive experi-ments demonstrate clear improvements in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations over state-of-the-art methods.

The goal of Single Image Super-Resolution(SISR) [10, 16, 26, 38] is to recover the high-resolution(HR) details of the image from its low-resolution(LR) counterpart. It has been widely used in image enhancement, video surveillance and remote sensing imaging. The ill-pose essence of SISR makes it easily resulting in visual artifacts as the scale fac-tor is large(×4). To tackle the problem, Reference-based
Super-Resolution(RefSR) has attracted much attention re-cently. Compared with SISR that only uses one single LR input, RefSR [13, 22, 27, 36, 40, 41] super-resolves the LR image with an additional HR reference image, which can provide abundant real textures for the super-resolved im-age. RefSR can be applied to plenty of scenarios, such as dual-cameras [31] and video streaming [25].
Current RefSR methods mostly transfer the textures based on the alignment between reference and LR im-ages, such as spatial alignment [27, 41] and patch match-ing [13, 22, 36, 40]. After alignment, RefSR methods con-catenate the LR and aligned reference features as the in-put and transfer the detailed textures to the output through some well-designed architectures, such as attention mecha-nism [36] and spatial adaptation module [22].
Although superior of the performance compared with
SISR, current methods are easily plagued by the reference-underuse issue(i.e., reference textures are transferred insuf-(a) Coupled framework (b) Task decoupled framework (cid:1839)(cid:1853)(cid:1872)(cid:1855)(cid:1860)(cid:1861)(cid:1866)(cid:1859) (cid:428) (cid:1849)(cid:1853)(cid:1870)(cid:1868)(cid:1861)(cid:1866)(cid:1859)

Figure 2. Framework Comparison. (a) After the alignment between LR and reference, previous coupled framework uses a single network to process the super-resolution of LR input and texture transfer at the same time, which easily introduces interference between LR and reference images, resulting in reference-underuse issue and reference-misuse issue as shown in Fig.1. (b) Our framework decouples the
RefSR process into super-resolution of LR image and texture transfer. In the super-resolution, we super-solve the LR input independently of the reference. In the texture transfer, we extract the texture information from reference, then transfer the detailed textures to the coarsely upsampled result.
ﬁciently) and the reference-misuse issue(i.e., irrelevant ref-erence content deteriorates the results) as shown in Fig.1.
The two issues are mainly due to the inadequate framework design of current RefSR methods, which couple the super-resolution task of the LR image and the texture transfer task from the reference image in one single module. As shown in Fig.2(a), most RefSR methods design a single module to execute the super-resolution task and the texture trans-fer task, using the concatenation of LR features and aligned reference features as the input. Processing the LR and ref-erence images simultaneously with convolution operation will introduce disturbance to each other. Speciﬁcally, on the one hand, if the reference is highly similar to the input LR image, the model should concentrate more on transferring the aligned reference features to the output. However, the texture transfer process can be interfered by the input LR image and result in the reference-underuse issue, in which the model outputs the average of the aligned reference im-age and the LR image, as shown in Fig.1(a). On the other hand, as the reference content is irrelevant to the LR in-put image, the incongruous reference will disturb the super-resolution task of the LR image, when processing the LR and reference images at the same time, which results in the reference-misuse issue as shown in Fig.1(b).
To handle the two issues, as shown in Fig.2 (b), we pro-pose a novel framework for RefSR based on decoupling the super-resolution task and the texture transfer task of RefSR.
The decoupled task of the super-resolution aims to super-resolve the LR image coarsely without the disturbance of the reference image. The texture transfer task is to extract the textures from the reference image and further transfer the detailed textures to the result of the super-resolution task. In addition, in order to extract and transfer abundant textures stably from the reference, we propose the texture extraction module and the adaptive texture transfer module.
On ﬁve benchmark datasets, CUFED5, Sun80, Urban100,
Manga109 and WR-SR, the experiment shows that the per-formance of our method exceeds state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.
To summarize, our contributions include:
• We deeply investigate the cause of the reference-underuse issue and the reference-misuse issue for RefSR.
The two issues are mainly due to the improper coupled framework of current RefSR methods.
• To tackle the two issues, we propose a novel framework for RefSR based on decoupling the super-resolution task and the texture transfer task. The super-resolution task up-samples the LR image independently, and the texture trans-fer task extracts and transfers textures from the reference image.
• Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method signiﬁcantly outperforms the existing RefSR meth-ods both quantitatively and qualitatively. 2.
