Abstract
The objective of this paper is few-shot object detection (FSOD) – the task of expanding an object detector for a new category given only a few instances for training. We introduce a simple pseudo-labelling method to source high-quality pseudo-annotations from the training set, for each new category, vastly increasing the number of training in-stances and reducing class imbalance; our method finds previously unlabelled instances.
Na¨ıvely training with model predictions yields sub-optimal performance; we present two novel methods to im-prove the precision of the pseudo-labelling process: first, we introduce a verification technique to remove candidate detections with incorrect class labels; second, we train a specialised model to correct poor quality bounding boxes.
After these two novel steps, we obtain a large set of high-quality pseudo-annotations that allow our final detector to be trained end-to-end. Additionally, we demonstrate our method maintains base class performance, and the utility of simple augmentations in FSOD. While benchmarking on
PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO, our method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best performance compared to existing approaches across all number of shots. 1.

Introduction
Object detection refers to the task of determining if an image contains objects of a particular category, and if so, then localising them. In recent years, the community has seen tremendous successes in object detection by train-ing computational models for a set of pre-defined object classes [8, 16, 32, 36, 40, 46, 55], with large numbers of human annotated labels, e.g. MS-COCO [30], and PAS-CAL VOC [11]. However, such training paradigms have limited the model to only perform well on a closed, small set of categories for which large training data is available.
In contrast, humans can continuously expand their vo-cabularies, learning to detect a much larger set of cate-gories, even with access to only a few examples [43]. This is also a desirable ability for modern computer vision sys-tems and is studied in the task of few-shot object detec-tion (FSOD) [13, 21, 45, 51, 56]. The goal of our work is FSOD: given an existing object detector that has been
trained on abundant data for some categories, termed base categories, we wish to learn to detect novel categories us-ing only a few annotations, e.g. 1–30 per category, whilst maintaining performance on the original base categories.
In this paper, we carefully examine the training proce-dure of the Faster R-CNN two-stage detector, and iden-tify two critical factors that limit its performance on FSOD.
First, training on base categories leads to a form of “super-vision collapse” [9]; this model is naturally trained against detecting instances from novel classes, as they were unla-belled and treated as background; second, the FSOD prob-lem involves learning from extremely unbalanced data – only K instances (K ≤ 30) are available per novel class for training, so the number of training samples for base cat-egories is far larger than that for novel ones. A model that overfits to a small number (K) of novel instances naturally lacks generalisation ability.
We adopt a simple pseudo-labelling technique (see Fig-ure 1) and address both the factors that limit performance: we show that the Region Proposal Network (RPN) can be modified to successfully propose regions for the novel cat-egories and use a detector trained with the few-shot novel data to label these regions over the images of the large training dataset, producing a set of candidate detections for each novel category. The novelty of our approach is in the two steps used to improve the precision of this candidate set: first, we build a classifier for novel categories to ver-ify the candidate detections using features from a network trained with self-supervision (see Figure 1, centre); second, we train a specialised box regressor that improves the qual-ity of the bounding box of the verified candidates (see Fig-ure 1, right). The two steps together yield a large set of high precision pseudo-annotations for the novel categories, removing the class imbalance in the training data. This en-ables the detector to be trained end-to-end using the pseudo-annotations for the novel categories together with the origi-nal groundtruth annotations for base categories, and simul-taneously avoids the impact of “supervision collapse” for all detector features.
To summarise, our contributions are as follows: (i) we carefully examine the problem of few-shot object detection with the modern two-stage object detector, e.g. Faster R-CNN, and identify the issue of “supervision collapse”; (ii) we introduce a novel verification and correction procedure to pseudo-labelling, which significantly improves the pre-cision of pseudo-annotations, both class labels and bound-ing box coordinates; (iii) we analyse several critical compo-nents of data augmentation and conduct thorough ablation studies to validate their necessity; (iv) with the combination of pseudo-labelling and aggressive data augmentations, we set state-of-the-art (SotA) or comparable performance us-ing a standard Faster R-CNN, for both the challenging MS-COCO benchmark and the PASCAL VOC benchmark.
We discuss potential ethical concerns and limitations of our work in arXiv version of the paper [23]. Code and pre-trained models are available from the project webpage. 2.
