Abstract
Color constancy is an essential function in digital pho-tography and a fundamental process for many computer vi-sion applications. Accordingly, many methods have been proposed, and some recent ones have used deep neural net-works to handle more complex scenarios. However, both the traditional and latest methods still impose strict assump-tions on their target scenes in explicit or implicit ways. This paper shows that the degree of linear polarization dramat-ically solves the color constancy problem because it allows us to find achromatic pixels stably. Because we only rely on the physics-based polarization model, we significantly reduce the assumptions compared to existing methods. Fur-thermore, we captured a wide variety of scenes with ground-truth illuminations for evaluation, and the proposed ap-proach achieved state-of-the-art performance with a low computational cost. Additionally, the proposed method can estimate illumination colors from chromatic pixels and manage multi-illumination scenes. Lastly, the evaluation scenes and codes are publicly available to encourage more development in this field. 1.

Introduction
When a light source illuminates an object, the observed color is determined by the reflectance of the object and the illumination color. The goal of color constancy is to sepa-rate the illumination color from the observation and obtain an image equivalent to one captured under achromatic illu-mination. Because human vision inherently has this abil-ity [6], color constancy is vital for digital photography to capture suitable images for human preferences. Addition-ally, color constancy is critical for various computer vision applications [5, 23, 57], including methods using deep neu-ral network (DNN) [2]. However, color constancy is still a challenging problem because separating the material re-flectance and illumination color from observation is funda-mentally ill-posed.
Some studies have introduced statistical knowledge about objects or illuminations in scenes to overcome the difficulty. Gray-world [12] and its extensions [17, 51] ex-ploit the assumption that the average value of objects’ re-flectance in a scene becomes achromatic. White-patch methods [20, 35] assume that scenes include perfect reflec-tion and regard the area as the representation of the illu-mination color. However, natural scenes frequently violate these statistical expectations, which significantly degrades the quality of the results.
Regarding data-driven algorithms, several illumination-estimation models have been developed using training data sets [11, 21, 23, 31]. More recently, methods that exploit
DNNs have been proposed and have achieved higher per-formance [30,41,47]. Furthermore, several approaches have
introduced new learning frameworks to handle images cap-tured by unknown cameras [1,29,39,54,58]. However, these learning-based methods are still highly dependent on the quality of the training data.
Speaking of polarization, it could help solve the color constancy problem because diffuse (representing material color) and specular (representing illumination color) polar-ization behave differently [53]. For instance, several studies have estimated illumination colors by assuming that only the specular reflection is polarized [18, 45], meaning that polarization amplitude directly represents the illumination color. However, because diffuse reflection also affects polarization [9, 33], this assumption incorrectly estimates illumination colors, especially when diffuse reflection dominates the scene.
In this paper, we show that degree of linear polarization (DoLP) significantly contributes to solving the color con-stancy problem because it allows us to find achromatic pix-els stably. Our main idea is quite simple: the DoLP val-ues of achromatic pixels are also achromatic regardless of the illumination colors. Figure 1 shows several color charts captured under different illuminations. Focusing on the achromatic squares located on the bottom row of the color chart, we notice that their DoLP values are always achro-matic despite the drastic change of illumination colors. In summary, our contributions are as follows:
• We propose the first approach to indicate the dramatic contribution of DoLP to solving the color constancy problem.
• Our method achieved state-of-the-art performance at a low computational cost on our new evaluation data, which include a wide variety of illuminations.
• The proposed approach is robust because it is inde-pendent of statistical knowledge about reflectance or illuminations, free from any optimization or training processes, and accurately considering diffuse polariza-tion.
• We widely analyzed how to estimate illuminations from chromatic pixels and examined a solution for multi-illumination scenes.
• Our codes and the created evaluation data are publicly available to encourage more advancement in this field. 2.
