Abstract
As an inherently ill-posed problem, depth estimation from single images is the most challenging part of monoc-ular 3D object detection (M3OD). Many existing methods rely on preconceived assumptions to bridge the missing spa-tial information in monocular images, and predict a sole depth value for every object of interest. However, these as-sumptions do not always hold in practical applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a depth solving system that fully explores the visual clues from the subtasks in M3OD and generates multiple estimations for the depth of each target. Since the depth estimations rely on different assump-tions in essence, they present diverse distributions. Even if some assumptions collapse, the estimations established on the remaining assumptions are still reliable. In addition, we develop a depth selection and combination strategy. This strategy is able to remove abnormal estimations caused by collapsed assumptions, and adaptively combine the remain-In this way, our depth ing estimations into a single one. solving system becomes more precise and robust. Exploit-ing the clues from multiple subtasks of M3OD and without introducing any extra information, our method surpasses the current best method by more than 20% relatively on the
Moderate level of test split in the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark, while still maintaining real-time efficiency. 1.

Introduction
Significant attention has been drawn by 3D object detec-tion due to its widespread applications in autonomous driv-ing and robotic navigation [2, 13, 14, 42]. Inaccurate detec-tion affects the motion planning process directly and could lead to serious accidents. Therefore, the industry has great demand for precise and robust 3D object detection systems.

Figure 1. Comparison among various depth solving strategies with different diversity levels. The value below each image is the mean absolute error of depth estimation on the KITTI validation set [12] if we always select the most accurate depth from multiple pro-duced estimations. As shown, the error decreases as the diversity of estimations increases.
Many recently proposed 3D object detection algorithms heavily rely on LiDARs [47] and stereo cameras [18], be-cause they are able to perceive the depth information of sur-roundings directly. Nevertheless, LiDAR sensors are ex-pensive while stereo cameras require exact online calibra-tion [22]. These limitations make 3D perception using only monocular images promising because it is economical and flexible for deployment.
The monocular 3D object detection community has achieved prominent progress in recent years. However, there still exists a huge performance gap between the monocular and LiDAR-based methods. This gap is caused by the fact that accurate localization of 3D objects relies on precise depth estimation, and predicting depth from monoc-ular images is an inherently ill-posed problem [25], which means the information contained in a single image is insuf-ficient for determining the depths of objects. To compen-sate the lack of information, current detectors usually resort to some preconceived assumptions. For example, SMOKE
[21] assumes that depth can be inferred from visual pixels
directly. MonoRCNN [39] hypothesizes the height of a tar-get can be estimated precisely and the camera is an ideal pinhole imaging model [37]. Nevertheless, these assump-tions do not always hold. When the assumptions fail, the single depth produced by a method becomes unreliable.
To address the aforementioned problem, we develop a depth solving system that provides diverse depth estima-tions for every target. Different from MonoFlex [45] that only utilizes limited information (direct estimation and the heights of objects) and generates similar depths, our method fully exploits various attribute combinations (direct estima-tion, keypoint, orientation and dimension of an object) to produce 20 depths, which present diverse distributions. Be-sides, since the 20 depths are separately obtained by solving 20 equations built upon different assumptions, part of the depths are still precise when some assumptions collapse.
Figure 1 illustrates the importance of diversity for monocu-lar depth estimation in the condition that the most accurate one can be selected from predicted depths. When only di-rect estimation (1 depth) is applied, the mean absolute error (MAE) of depth estimation is 0.6220. In contrast, utilizing our depth solving system, the MAE decreases to 0.2819.
Although the depths produced by our depth solving sys-tem include promising estimations, they also contain out-liers. The following problem is how to select promising es-timations and combine them into a single value. To that end, we devise a strategy that removes outliers iteratively and in-tegrates the remaining depths based on uncertainty. The ex-perimental results in Section 5.3 suggest that this strategy is crucial for the overall performance.
Last but not least, considering the uncertainty of both the combined depth and 3D box vertexes, we propose a new scheme, named 3D geometry confidence, to model the conditional 3D confidence. Compared with existing strate-gies such as modeling the confidence with 3D IOU [6], our scheme generalizes better.
Incorporating all the techniques, the resulting Monocu-lar 3D detector with diverse depth estimations, named Mon-oDDE, fully exploits depth clues in monocular images and produce reliable 3D detection boxes in practical applica-tions. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We point out that the diversity of depth estimation is critical for monocular 3D object detection. Correspond-ingly, a novel depth solving system that produces 20 depths for every target is developed.
• We devise a strategy that removes outliers caused by collapsed assumptions and combines the remaining reliable estimations into a single depth. Besides, a new scheme for modeling the conditional 3D confidence is developed.
• Using a single model, MonoDDE outperforms the cur-rent best method by 20.96% relatively on the Moderate level of the Car class in KITTI, and ranks 1st and 2nd on the Cy-clist and Pedestrian classes, respectively. 2.
