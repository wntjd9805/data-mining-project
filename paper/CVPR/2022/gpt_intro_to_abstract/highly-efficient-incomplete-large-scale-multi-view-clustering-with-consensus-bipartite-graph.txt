Multi-view clustering (MVC) is an effective approach to divide data samples into clusters based on their structural similarities. Existing MVC algorithms have been proposed in computer vision and machine learning, but most of them assume that all views are complete. However, in real-world scenarios, some instances may be inaccessible from certain views, leading to incomplete multi-view data. This incomplete data causes performance degradation and challenges existing MVC algorithms. To address this problem, researchers have proposed matrix factorization, graph or kernel-based, and deep learning approaches for incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). However, these approaches have limitations in terms of computational complexity and scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called IMVC-CBG (Incomplete Large-scale Multi-View Clustering using Consensus Bipartite Graph), which combines the concepts of IMVC and bipartite graph to handle arbitrary view incompleteness. We formalize the IMVC problem under an incomplete bipartite graph framework, and propose a four-step alternative optimization algorithm for efficient and effective clustering. Our proposed method has linear complexity and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale IMVC tasks. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to other IMVC competitors. Notably, our proposed algorithm is the first to efficiently run on datasets with over 100,000 samples and 64GB RAM in the IMVC community. Our main contributions include the introduction of a flexible framework that integrates IMVC and bipartite graph, the utilization of a unified bipartite graph to capture complementary information and recover clustering structures across incomplete views, and the design of an efficient optimization algorithm with proven convergence.
