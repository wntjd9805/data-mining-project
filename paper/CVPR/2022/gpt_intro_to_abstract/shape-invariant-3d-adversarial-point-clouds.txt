Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown impressive performance in computer vision tasks. However, recent studies reveal that DNNs are susceptible to adversarial examples, where imperceptible perturbations are added to clean inputs to mislead the predictions of deep learning models. While adversarial attacks on 2D images have been extensively studied, there is a growing interest in extending these attacks to 3D point clouds, a popular data representation captured by sensors like LiDAR. Existing 3D adversarial attack methods either generate noticeable point perturbations or focus solely on white-box attacks, resulting in poor performance on well-defended or unseen black-box models. The motivation for black-box attacks on point cloud recognition lies in the need to evaluate the robustness of point cloud models, particularly in security-critical applications such as autonomous driving. However, due to trade secret protection agreements, the details of the models cannot be disclosed to testers. Hence, black-box attacks become necessary for robustness evaluation, requiring efficient methods that outperform current approaches.To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first query-based black-box attack algorithm on point cloud recognition. By leveraging the sensitivity map from a white-box surrogate model, the proposed method limits point movement on the shape surface to generate adversarial examples. To enhance query efficiency, the approach exploits certified best directions for each point as a basis for perturbation. Only one basis is perturbed at each query step according to sensitivity ranking. Experimental evaluations on ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in attacking various 3D recognition models, highlighting the significance of the point-cloud sensitivity map.In summary, this paper contributes in three ways: 1) it introduces the point-cloud sensitivity map for evaluating the variance of recognition confidence when encountering shape-invariant perturbations, 2) it proposes a strong shape-invariant white-box attack and the first query-based black-box attack on point cloud recognition guided by the sensitivity map, and 3) experimental results showcase the efficiency, imperceptibility, and low query cost of the proposed attack under black-box settings.
