Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision that aims to enable computers to understand visual emotions. Recent advancements in deep FER have been driven by large-scale labeled datasets, but collecting such datasets is expensive and challenging. Additionally, existing labels often do not satisfy fine-grained needs, and re-labeling data requires human experts. Therefore, there is a need for a powerful method to train models on a large amount of data without corresponding labels, known as semi-supervised deep facial expression recognition (SS-DFER).Many recent semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms achieve competitive performance by predicting artificial labels for unlabeled data. However, applying these methods to SS-DFER is challenging due to two main reasons. First, the fixed threshold-based pseudo-labeling strategy used in these methods may lead to unfair selection of expressions with different levels of difficulty. Second, there is an inefficient utilization of data due to the large gap in confidence scores between different intra-class samples.To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised DFER algorithm called Adaptive Confidence Margin (Ada-CM). Ada-CM adaptively learns the confidence margin based on the learning difficulty of different facial expressions. It gradually improves the confidence margin over training epochs and predicts confidence scores for weakly-augmented unlabeled data. These scores are compared with the learned confidence margin to partition the unlabeled samples into two subsets. Subset I contains samples with high confidence scores, which are used to calculate the cross-entropy loss. Subset II contains samples with low confidence scores, and a feature-level contrastive objective is applied to learn effective features using the InfoNCE loss.Our main contributions include proposing an end-to-end semi-supervised DFER method that adaptively learns the confidence margin, the design of an adaptive confidence margin that dynamically learns from all unlabeled data, and extensive experiments on four challenging datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Ada-CM. Our method achieves superior performance, surpassing fully-supervised baselines in a semi-supervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution to explore the dynamic confidence margin in SS-DFER.
