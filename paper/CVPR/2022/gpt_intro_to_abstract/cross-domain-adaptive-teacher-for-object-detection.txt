This paper introduces a self-training framework called Adaptive Teacher (AT) to improve domain adaptation in object detection. The goal is to transfer knowledge learned from a labeled dataset (source domain) to an unlabeled dataset (target domain). Existing methods in cross-domain adaptation have used domain classifiers and adversarial learning, but there is still a performance gap compared to fully supervised models. The researchers propose using the teacher-student self-training method, where a teacher model generates pseudo labels to update a student model. However, the teacher-student framework faces challenges due to the large domain gap between the source and target domains, resulting in inaccurate pseudo labels. To address this, the Adaptive Teacher framework incorporates adversarial learning and mutual learning. It consists of a target-specific teacher model and a cross-domain student model. Weak augmentation is used in the teacher model to generate reliable pseudo labels, and strong augmentation is used in the student model. Adversarial learning is applied to mitigate domain bias, aligning the distribution across the two domains in the student model. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly improves the quality of pseudo labels and achieves higher accuracy compared to existing methods. For example, on the Foggy Cityscape dataset, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.9%, which is 9.2% and 8.2% higher than the state-of-the-art and fully supervised Oracle model, respectively. The contributions of this paper are: 1) highlighting the limitations of the teacher-student framework in the domain adaptation scenario, 2) introducing a novel framework that combines adversarial learning, mutual learning, and weak-strong augmentation to address domain shift in cross-domain object detection, and 3) achieving superior performance compared to existing methods in domain adaptation.
