Object detection plays a vital role in computer vision for various applications such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics vision. Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in object detection in recent years. Current deep architectures for object detection consist of a backbone for feature extraction and a decision head for producing predictions. However, the simple design of single-node prediction in the decision head may hinder the performance of object detection. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an approach to introduce soft decision trees into object detection. The soft decision trees disentangle routing choices and prediction values, allowing for more diverse feature exploration. The randomized decision routing is used to learn divergent decisions from different nodes, improving overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving over 3.6% improvement in average precision (AP) and significant accuracy improvements for large objects. This approach bridges the gap between neural networks and decision trees, offering insights for future research in this field.
