This paper focuses on the challenge of recognizing face images of low quality, which can be encountered in surveillance videos and drone footage. Most popular training datasets still consist of high quality images, so it is important to properly leverage low quality data during training. The problem with low quality images is that they tend to be unrecognizable, leading to poor performance during testing. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel loss function called AdaFace that assigns different importance to samples based on their difficulty and image quality. The paper demonstrates that the feature norm can serve as a proxy for image quality and shows the effectiveness of AdaFace through extensive evaluations on various datasets. The results show that the recognition performance on low quality datasets can be greatly improved while maintaining performance on high quality datasets.
