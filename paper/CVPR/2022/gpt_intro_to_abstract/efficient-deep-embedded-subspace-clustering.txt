Clustering is a vital task in machine learning, where the objective is to group samples into distinct classes based on their similarities. Traditional clustering algorithms like k-means and spectral clustering have shown success in real-world applications. However, they struggle with complex data structures and high-dimensionality, which can be improved by using refined features. Some previous works have utilized feature learning techniques to enhance clustering accuracy but lack specificity to clustering. Recent end-to-end clustering methods integrate clustering objectives with network optimization, but they often rely on Euclidean distance-based measures, which may not be suitable for all types of data structures. Subspace clustering has shown promise in handling data in different subspaces, but existing approaches are not scalable for large datasets. This paper proposes an efficient and accurate deep subspace clustering method that learns subspace bases from latent features extracted by t-SNE. The proposed method achieves simultaneous optimization of cluster centers and embedded features. The contributions of this work include a novel deep subspace clustering method that goes beyond the traditional self-expressive framework, linear time and space complexity for scalability to large-scale subspace clustering, extension to online clustering for handling large and streaming datasets, and analysis of the feasibility of using deep neural networks for distance-based clustering and subspace clustering. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.
