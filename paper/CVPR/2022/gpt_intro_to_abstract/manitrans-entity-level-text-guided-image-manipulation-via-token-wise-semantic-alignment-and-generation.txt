Image manipulation is an active area of research in computer science, with various branches such as style transfer, image translation, and Text-Guided Image Manipulation (TGIM). Previous TGIM methods have focused on manipulating objects based on simple text instructions or manipulating appearance and style. In this paper, we introduce a novel and challenging task called entity-Level Text-Guided Image Manipulation (eL-TGIM), which involves manipulating entities in a natural image based on text descriptions. This task requires fine-grained manipulation at the entity level, making it more difficult than traditional TGIM. Existing TGIM methods have limitations in identifying and editing entity properties. To address this, we propose a framework called Manipulating Transformers (ManiTrans) that utilizes token-wise semantic alignment and generation. Our framework includes a transformer-based image synthesizer component (Trans) and an entity-level semantic manipulator component (Mani). Trans leverages transformer-based architecture and learns to downsample and quantize images as sequences of discrete image tokens, fitting the joint distribution with a transformer-based auto-regressive model. Mani incorporates a semantic alignment module and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) module to identify and modify text-relevant image tokens. The CLIP module also serves as a semantic loss to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Our approach is evaluated on multiple datasets, demonstrating superior capability in manipulating entities while preserving the background region. It can manipulate both texture/color and structure of objects guided by various textual descriptions. In summary, our contributions include the proposal of the ManiTrans framework for entity-level text-guided image manipulation, the incorporation of semantic alignment and loss modules, and the utilization of transformer-based image synthesis and CLIP. Experimental results show competitive performance compared to baseline methods on CUB, Oxford, and COCO datasets.
