Abstract:The extraction of vector representations of building polygons from aerial and satellite imagery is essential for various remote sensing applications. Existing methods for building extraction and polygonization rely on the vectorization of probability maps generated by segmentation networks. However, these approaches are not end-to-end learned, leading to imperfect and artifact-ridden polygons. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, PolyWorld, which combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting building corners and a learned matching procedure to connect them, resulting in the generation of valid polygons in an end-to-end fashion. PolyWorld utilizes a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to propagate global information and enhance the distinctiveness of vertex embeddings. Additionally, the GNN refines the position of detected corners to minimize losses related to segmentation and polygonal angle differences. Experimental results demonstrate that PolyWorld outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation and detection accuracy, while producing more regular and clean building polygons.
