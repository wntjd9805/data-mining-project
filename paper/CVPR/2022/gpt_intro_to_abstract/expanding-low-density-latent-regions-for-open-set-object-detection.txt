In this paper, we address the challenge of open-set object detection, where modern object detectors are often developed with the assumption that the object categories appearing in the testing process are contained by the training sets. However, in real-world scenarios, there are many object categories that have never been seen in the training data. To alleviate this issue, we propose an Open-set Detector (OpenDet) that can detect known objects and identify unknown objects in open-set conditions.We draw inspiration from the observation that known objects tend to form high-density regions in the latent space, while unknown objects are distributed in low-density regions. Traditional methods only maintain limited low-density regions, making it difficult to identify unknown objects. In our approach, we learn compact features of known classes, leaving more low-density regions for unknown classes. We also learn an unknown probability for each instance, which serves as a threshold to divide more low-density regions around the cluster of known classes.Our OpenDet consists of two learners: the Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and the Unknown Probability Learner (UPL). CFL performs instance-level contrastive learning to encourage intra-class compactness and inter-class separation of known classes, expanding the low-density regions. UPL learns the unknown probability for each instance based on the uncertainty of predictions, allowing us to identify unknown objects based on the highest unknown probability.We evaluate the effectiveness of OpenDet on the PASCAL VOC dataset for close-set training and construct several open-set settings considering both VOC and COCO datasets. Our method shows significant improvements on all open-set metrics without compromising the close-set accuracy. For example, OpenDet reduces the Absolute Open-Set Errors by 25%-35% on six open-set settings. We also visualize the latent features, demonstrating the clear separation between known and unknown classes.Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to analyze the impact of our main components and core design choices. Furthermore, we show that OpenDet can be easily extended to one-stage detectors and achieve satisfactory results. In summary, our contributions include being the first to address the challenging task of open-set object detection by modeling low-density latent regions, proposing an end-to-end trainable OpenDet with CFL and UPL, and introducing a new OSOD benchmark.
