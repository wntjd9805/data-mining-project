Stereo matching plays a crucial role in various applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in this field, achieving high inference accuracy and efficiency remains a challenge. This paper aims to explore a more efficient and effective form of cost volume representation for stereo matching. The authors propose an attention concatenation volume (ACV) that combines a correlation volume and a concatenation volume to suppress redundant information and maintain sufficient information for matching. They also introduce a novel multi-level adaptive patch matching method to improve similarity measures. Experimental results show that the ACV significantly reduces the computational burden of cost aggregation while achieving better accuracy than existing methods. The ACV is a general representation that can be integrated into various CNN stereo models, resulting in significant performance improvements. The proposed ACVNet ranks among the top methods in various benchmark datasets and demonstrates good generalization ability. Additionally, a real-time version of ACVNet outperforms state-of-the-art real-time methods.
