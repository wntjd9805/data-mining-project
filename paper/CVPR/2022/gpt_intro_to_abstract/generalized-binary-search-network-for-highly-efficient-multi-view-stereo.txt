Multi-view Stereo (MVS) is a fundamental topic in computer vision that aims to reconstruct the 3D geometry of a scene using a set of overlapping images. Recent advances in deep learning have improved traditional MVS pipelines by designing deep networks for dense depth prediction. However, these methods are often limited by their high memory consumption due to the use of 3D cost volumes. In this paper, we explore the question of finding the minimum volume size that can maintain satisfactory accuracy while minimizing memory usage. We propose a binary search approach that significantly reduces the size of the cost volumes by performing comparisons and eliminating half of the search space in each stage. To address the issue of out-of-bin error, we introduce three effective mechanisms and propose a generalized binary search deep network (GBi-Net) for highly efficient MVS. Our extensive experiments show that GBi-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, demonstrating improved efficiency without sacrificing depth prediction accuracy. In summary, our contributions include investigating efficient MVS from a search strategies perspective, proposing a discrete binary search method (Bi-Net) to decrease memory usage, and designing GBi-Net with mechanisms to address out-of-bin error and improve efficiency.
