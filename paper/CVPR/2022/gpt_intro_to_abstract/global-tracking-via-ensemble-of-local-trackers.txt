The paper introduces the topic of long-term visual tracking, which has gained attention in the visual tracking community. Long-term tracking is more relevant to real-world applications due to differences in sequence duration and target discontinuous moving. The paper discusses existing tracking strategies such as local-global switching and global tracking and their limitations. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a global tracking algorithm using an ensemble of local trackers. The algorithm combines the advantages of both local-global switching and global tracking, allowing for tracking in a global view while exploiting temporal context. The collaboration mechanisms of the algorithm are described, including the movement of local trackers to track the target and the transfer of temporal context for improved tracking robustness. The paper presents a deformable attention-based local tracker and a temporal context transferring scheme as key components of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
