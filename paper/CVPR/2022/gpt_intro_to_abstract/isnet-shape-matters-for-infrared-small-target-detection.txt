Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is a critical task with applications in traffic management and marine rescue. Traditional methods for IRSTD, such as filtering-based approaches and human visual system (HVS) techniques, have limitations in suppressing background clutter and producing accurate results. The use of hand-crafted features in these methods is also suboptimal and requires expert knowledge. In recent years, deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in improving IRSTD performance. However, existing CNN-based methods still struggle to accurately detect the shape and contours of infrared small targets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Infrared Shape Network (ISNet) that addresses this challenge by incorporating target shape reconstruction into IRSTD. ISNet consists of a Taylor finite difference (TFD)-inspired edge block to capture edge features and a two-orientation attention aggregation (TOAA) block for extracting cross-level features. By stacking multiple TFD-inspired edge blocks and TOAA blocks, ISNet can capture long-range contextual information and accurately locate small infrared targets. We also introduce a new benchmark dataset, IRSTD-1k, consisting of 1,000 realistic images with accurate pixel-level annotations, to facilitate research in the field. Experimental results on both the NUAA-SIRST dataset and IRSTD-1k demonstrate that ISNet outperforms state-of-the-art IRSTD methods in terms of false alarm rate, probability detection rate, intersection over union (IoU) ratio, and normalized intersection over union (nIoU) ratio. The contributions of this study include the novel idea of incorporating target shape reconstruction into IRSTD, the development of TFD-inspired edge and TOAA blocks for feature extraction, and the creation of the IRSTD-1k benchmark dataset.
