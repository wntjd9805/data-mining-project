Egocentric motion capture using head- or body-mounted cameras has gained popularity as it overcomes limitations of traditional motion capture systems. Traditional systems with outside-in cameras restrict the scope of applications when people move in large spaces. In contrast, egocentric motion capture systems are mobile, flexible, and have no space requirements, enabling a wider range of human activities for various applications. This paper focuses on estimating the full 3D body pose using a single head-mounted fisheye camera. Existing methods in this area, such as Mo2Cap2 and xR-egopose, have produced promising results but suffer from performance drops in real-world scenarios, especially when handling occlusions. To address this issue, the authors capture a large-scale in-the-wild egocentric dataset called Egocentric Poses in the Wild (EgoPW). This dataset contains over 312k frames covering 20 different daily activities in 8 everyday scenes. To obtain supervision for network training, a new device setup consisting of an egocentric camera and a single auxiliary external camera is used. This external view provides additional supervision, especially for highly occluded regions in the egocentric view. The proposed method utilizes weakly supervised learning on the EgoPW dataset, employing spatio-temporal optimization to generate accurate 3D poses as pseudo labels for training an egocentric pose estimation network. Additionally, features extracted from an external pose estimation network are used to improve the network performance. Synthetic data is also incorporated in training, and domain adaptation is employed to minimize the gap between synthetic and real data. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively on test data from previous works. The contributions of this paper include a new method for estimating egocentric human pose with weak supervision from an external view, a large in-the-wild egocentric dataset (EgoPW), an optimization method for generating pseudo labels, and an adversarial method for training the network.
