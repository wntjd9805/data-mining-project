In this paper, we present the deep progressive image codec using trit-planes (DPICT) with fine granular scalability (FGS). Traditional image codecs, such as JPEG and JPEG2000, rely on hand-crafted features and modules for efficient image compression. However, with the advent of deep learning and ample training data, learning-based codecs utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have emerged.These learning-based codecs have shown competitive or even superior rate-distortion performance compared to classical codecs. Progressive compression, which allows for encoding an image into a single bitstream that can be decoded at multiple bit rates, is crucial. This enables different devices to receive the same image at different qualities without the need for multiple non-scalable bitstreams.Existing learning-based progressive codecs support coarse granular scalability, limiting the number of decoding rates. Our proposed algorithm is the first learning-based codec with fine granular scalability, meaning that a single bitstream can be truncated at any points to reconstruct the image faithfully. Additionally, our algorithm achieves better rate-distortion performance compared to conventional learning-based progressive codecs.The deep progressive image codec using trit-planes (DPICT) with FGS operates by transforming the image into a latent tensor represented by ternary digits (trits). The latent tensor trit-plane is then encoded in decreasing order of significance, with trits within the same trit-plane sorted according to rate-distortion priorities. At the decoder, using fewer trit-planes results in degraded image quality due to quantization errors and noisy artifacts. To mitigate these artifacts, postprocessing networks are developed.Experimental results demonstrate that DPICT significantly outperforms conventional progressive codecs while supporting fine granular scalability. This research contributes to the field of image compression by introducing a learning-based codec that offers both enhanced scalability and improved rate-distortion performance.
