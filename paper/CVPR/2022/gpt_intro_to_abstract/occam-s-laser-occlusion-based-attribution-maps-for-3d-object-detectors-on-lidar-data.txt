The focus of this computer science paper is on the increasing interest in 3D object detection in the context of autonomous driving. Specifically, the paper highlights the importance of detecting objects in point clouds acquired with LiDAR sensors. While there have been numerous publications and datasets on LiDAR data, the explainability of deep neural network-based detectors in this domain is relatively unexplored. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing a method to generate point-level attribution maps for 3D object detectors on LiDAR point clouds, making the decisions of these models more transparent.The paper introduces the concept of attribution or saliency maps, commonly used for image-based models, where the importance of input pixels is visualized. However, existing approaches for generating point-level attribution maps mainly focus on point cloud classification models and require prior knowledge of the architecture and access to gradients, limiting their applicability for object detection tasks. Furthermore, the complexity of detectors and the interdependence of object classification and localization pose additional challenges for gradient-based methods.To overcome these limitations, the paper presents a novel method called OccAM (Occlusion-based Attribution Maps) for generating point-level attribution maps. Inspired by perturbation approaches for black-box image models, OccAM leverages the principle of analysis by occlusion to estimate the importance of points in the input point cloud. The assumption is that removing or perturbing important areas in the input will result in less accurate or missed object detections. The paper proposes a voxel-based sub-sampling strategy, taking into account the unstructured nature and depth-dependent point density of LiDAR data. A similarity metric optimized for 3D bounding boxes is also used to evaluate the influence on detections.The paper evaluates the proposed method using the PointPillars detector as a case study and demonstrates the interpretability and informativeness of the generated attribution maps. The maps provide insights into potential sources of false detections and regions of particular importance. Additionally, the paper compares the average attribution maps of different state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, namely PointPillars, SECOND, and PV-RCNN, to analyze possible differences.In summary, this paper presents a method for generating point-level attribution maps for 3D object detectors on LiDAR point clouds, aiming to enhance the transparency and interpretability of these models in the context of autonomous driving.
