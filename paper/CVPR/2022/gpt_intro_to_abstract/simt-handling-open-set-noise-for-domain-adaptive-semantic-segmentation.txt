This paper addresses the problem of domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, particularly in scenarios where only pseudo-labeled target data is available. The challenge lies in the noisy pseudo labels generated for the target domain data. Existing methods tackle this issue by selecting reliable pseudo labels using confidence scores or uncertainty measures, or by denoising the pseudo labels based on prototypes or noise transition matrices. However, these methods assume a shared label set between the source and target domains and only consider closed-set noisy pseudo labels. In real-world scenarios, the label space of the target domain may differ from that of the source domain, and open-set class instances are common. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a SimT model to capture both closed-set and open-set noise distributions in the pseudo labels. SimT is a class-dependent and instance-independent transition matrix that rectifies the supervision signals derived from noisy labels. Three regularizers are introduced to estimate SimT, namely volume regularization, anchor guidance, and convex guarantee. Experimental results show that the proposed SimT improves the performance of existing domain adaptation methods. Overall, this work presents a practical framework for robustly learning from noisy pseudo-labeled target data, considering both closed-set and open-set label noises, and represents the first attempt to address the problem of open-set noisy labels in domain adaptation.
