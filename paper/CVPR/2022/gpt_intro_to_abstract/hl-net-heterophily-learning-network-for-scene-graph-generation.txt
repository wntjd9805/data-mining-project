Scene graph generation (SGG) is a popular research area in computer science that focuses on depicting visual scenes as graph structures, with objects as nodes and their relationships as edges. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used for SGG, but they typically assume homophily between objects/relationships, treating them as belonging to the same categories. However, real scene graphs often exhibit heterophily, or interactions between objects/relationships from different categories. In this paper, we propose a Heterophily Learning Network (HL-Net) for SGG that explicitly models heterophily in object/relationship classes. We introduce an Adaptive Reweighting Transformer (ART) to refine object representations, taking into account heterophily. We then develop a Relationship Feature Propagation (RFP) module to explore heterophilic relationships. Finally, we devise a Heterophily-aware Message Passing (HMP) scheme to identify heterophily and homophily in complicated visual scenes. Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HL-Net and the importance of considering heterophily in SGG.
