In recent years, there has been significant progress in high-level computer vision tasks such as image segmentation and object detection. However, these tasks tend to suffer from performance degradation under rainy weather conditions. Various supervised deraining methods have been proposed to alleviate the influence of rain, but they struggle to generalize to real rain due to the domain gap between synthetic and complex real rain. This paper aims to address this challenge by proposing an unsupervised method for removing real rain.Previous methods have used optimization-based and learning-based approaches to handle complex rainy images. However, hand-crafted priors used in optimization-based methods have limited representation ability, while learning-based methods still struggle to bridge the gap between synthetic and real rain degradation. Semi-supervised deraining methods have also been proposed, but they still rely on the distribution gap between simulated and real rainy images.To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a contrastive learning framework for unsupervised image deraining. The core idea is that similar samples should have similar representations while dissimilar samples should have different representations in the embedding space. The proposed method formulates image deraining as an image decomposition task, where clean image patches are treated as positives and rain layer patches as negatives. This approach takes advantage of the properties of both image and rain layers and models their mutually exclusive relationship for improved decomposition.Furthermore, the proposed method does not require clean supervision, allowing it to generalize well to real-world rainy images. The key factor in contrastive learning is how to construct different views for positive and negative samples. Instead of relying on instance-level hand-crafted augmentations, this paper introduces patch-level self-similarity within a single image. This approach utilizes non-local self-similarity to capture cross-patch relations and improve positive/negative sampling for discriminative representation learning.The contributions of this work include:- The proposal of a non-local contrastive learning method (NLCL) for unsupervised image deraining that exploits the specific properties of image and rain layers while modeling their contrastive relationship.- The introduction of non-local self-similarity in contrastive learning to improve positive/negative sampling and enhance the representation for better decomposition.- Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrating the superiority of NLCL over state-of-the-art methods for real image deraining.
