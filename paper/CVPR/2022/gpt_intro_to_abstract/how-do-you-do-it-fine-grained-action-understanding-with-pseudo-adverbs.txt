This paper focuses on recognizing fine-grained differences in actions, such as variations in speed or evenness. Understanding how actions are performed is crucial for comprehension and imitation. While previous works have explored what, when, who, and where actions happen, few have examined how actions happen. This paper aims to address this gap by studying adverb recognition in actions. Previous research on adverb recognition has either focused on facial expressions and limited adverbs or faced challenges in data collection. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for adverb recognition, using videos with action labels and multi-adverb pseudo-labeling. The main contributions of this paper include a method for semi-supervised learning of adverbs, the creation of new adverb recognition benchmarks, and the demonstration of improved performance in recognizing adverbs and enhancing generalization across tasks.
