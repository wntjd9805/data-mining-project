Coordinate networks are a class of neural networks that can represent and optimize various types of signals, such as images, video, audio, etc. Unlike traditional grid-based formats, coordinate networks use a continuous function embedded in the weights of a neural network to approximate signals. These networks have gained popularity in applications such as view synthesis, image processing, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering. However, current coordinate networks are black box models designed for single-scale representation and lack scale awareness.In this paper, we propose a new architecture called band-limited coordinate networks (BACON) that addresses the limitations of current coordinate networks. BACON allows manipulation of the maximum frequency at each layer analytically and its behavior is entirely characterized by its Fourier spectrum. This makes BACON suitable for multiscale signal representation, as the band-limited output layers can be designed to have a bias towards a particular resolution or scale.We also introduce methods for spectral analysis of the architecture, along with a principled band-limited initialization scheme. Through various applications, such as multiscale image representation, neural radiance fields, and 3D scenes, we demonstrate the effectiveness of BACON compared to conventional single-scale coordinate networks. Our contributions include the introduction of band-limited coordinate networks, the development of spectral analysis methods, and the demonstration of superior performance in multi-scale tasks.Overall, our work aims to make coordinate-based networks scale aware and provide a new representation with interpretable behavior. By addressing the limitations of current coordinate networks, BACON opens up possibilities for improved signal representation and optimization in various applications.
