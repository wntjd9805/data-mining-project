This paper addresses the problem of metric human pose reconstruction from a single view image by incorporating audio signals as a new sensing modality. The authors propose that the audio signals undergo a characteristic transformation induced by the geometry of reflective physical objects, including the human body. This transformation, called the pose kernel, is indicative of body pose geometry and can be used to reason about metric scale reconstruction. The pose kernel is parametrized using a time-invariant transfer function and possesses three key properties: metric property, uniqueness, and invariance. However, integrating the pose kernel with spatially-encoded 2D pose detection and generalizing to new scenes is challenging. To address this, the authors propose a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that fuses the pose kernels from multiple microphones and the 2D pose detected from an image. They also introduce a new dataset called the PoseKernel dataset to evaluate the performance of their metric lifting method. Results show that their approach outperforms state-of-the-art 3D pose reconstruction approaches. The authors emphasize the importance of metric scale in applications such as smart home facilitation, robotics, and augmented reality and highlight the limitations of existing approaches. Their method provides reliable 3D pose reconstruction regardless of the heights of target persons, making it applicable to both adults and minors. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of their work for smart home technology and its potential to monitor vulnerable populations. The contributions of this paper include the formulation of the pose kernel, the spatial encoding for fusing visual and audio features, the multi-stage 3D CNN architecture, and the strong performance of their method compared to existing approaches.
