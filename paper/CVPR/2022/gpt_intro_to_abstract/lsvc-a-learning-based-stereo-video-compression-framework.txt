Stereo cameras are widely used in autonomous driving applications for their ability to provide accurate depth information. As the demand for storing and transmitting automotive stereo videos increases, effective compression of this data has become a significant challenge. Existing multi-view video compression (MVC) standards rely on hand-crafted modules and do not exploit cross-view redundancy, limiting their compression performance. Furthermore, developing a learning-based stereo video codec remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a learning-based stereo video compression (LSVC) framework specifically designed for autonomous driving. Unlike traditional codecs that solely compress one view, our framework effectively reduces both temporal and binocular redundancy in stereo videos from both views. We leverage information from one view to assist in compressing the other view iteratively. Our approach estimates motion and disparity offsets between frames, performs motion and disparity compression, and generates intra-view and inter-view compensated features. We introduce new approaches, motion residual compression (MRC) and disparity residual compression (DRC), to compress the introduced motion and disparity offsets effectively. By leveraging the geometric and temporal correlations between frames, we only need to compress the residual offset information, resulting in better bit-rate savings. Our modules are implemented using fully-differentiable deep neural networks, and all coding operations are performed in the feature space for improved performance. We evaluate our proposed framework on three automotive stereo video benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms other codecs significantly. Our contributions include the first end-to-end optimized stereo video compression framework that reduces intra-view and inter-view redundancy, introducing MRC and DRC schemes for effective compression of complex motion and disparity offsets, and achieving state-of-the-art results for compressing automotive stereo videos.
