Face alignment is a challenging task, particularly in situations where occlusion is present, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic where people wear medical masks. Existing methods have limitations in localizing facial landmarks accurately due to invisible landmarks, scarcity of occlusion datasets, and inability to model spatial relationships between facial components. Some methods enhance facial context features but may introduce occlusion information over the entire face, reducing accuracy on non-occluded areas. Integrating related tasks to improve occlusion robustness may increase annotation and computational costs. Boundary estimation has been explored as a solution but is prone to failure under extreme occlusion and is computationally complex.This paper proposes a new neural network architecture called GlomFace to address occlusion in face alignment. GlomFace consists of two modules: the part-whole hierarchical module (PHM) and the whole-part hierarchical module (WHM). PHM captures short-range spatial dependencies within facial parts and gradually combines adjacent patches into larger units, suppressing multi-scale occlusion information. WHM disentangles the whole representation into low-level parts, considering both the coupling relations between adjacent parts and the constrained relations of high-level parts over their internal low-level parts. Hierarchical relations are built to achieve structure reasoning against shape damages of facial landmarks. The predicted landmarks are used to update the position of shape-indexed patches for refinement.Experimental results demonstrate that GlomFace is more robust to occlusion and requires fewer floating-point operations compared to existing hourglass-based methods. GlomFace shows promising performance even under extreme occlusion cases. The proposed architecture has the potential to improve the accuracy of face alignment by leveraging the inherent viewpoint-invariant hierarchies of facial landmarks. Further research can explore the application of GlomFace in real-world scenarios and investigate its potential for other computer vision tasks.
