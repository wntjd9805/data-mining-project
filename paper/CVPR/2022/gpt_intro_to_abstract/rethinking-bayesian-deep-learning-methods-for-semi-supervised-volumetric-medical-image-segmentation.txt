This paper investigates the problem of semi-supervised segmentation of medical images in computer vision. The scarcity and difficulty of obtaining labeled medical image datasets have made the development of methods for semi-supervised segmentation crucial. Previous methods, particularly those based on Bayesian deep learning, have shown promise in generating pseudo labels for unlabeled data. However, these methods suffer from two key issues: overfitting to limited labeled data and a lack of a solid theoretical basis. To address these problems, the authors propose a new generative model, called generative Bayesian deep learning (GBDL), which estimates the joint probability distribution of inputs and labels based on both labeled and unlabeled data. GBDL is entirely designed under the Bayesian framework and provides a full Bayesian formulation, offering a solid theoretical foundation for the architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that GBDL outperforms previous methods in terms of evaluation indicators on three public medical datasets. This paper provides a detailed description of the GBDL architecture, its Bayesian formulation, and presents promising results, positioning GBDL as a superior approach for semi-supervised volumetric medical image segmentation.
