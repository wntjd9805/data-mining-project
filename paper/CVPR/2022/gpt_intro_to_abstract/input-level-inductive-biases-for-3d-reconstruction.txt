The focus of modern computer vision research is to identify good architectures for each task of interest. Creating dedicated models for every possible task results in a complex and non-scalable approach. To overcome this, one option is to employ models without much customization or inductive biases for any particular task, but these models will be less accurate given a fixed data budget. In this paper, we explore the idea of replacing the lack of architecture-level inductive biases with extra inputs that encode our knowledge about the problem structure. We use the Perceiver IO as the general model and focus on multi-view geometry and 3D reconstruction. Our main contribution is in mapping out and evaluating different options for expressing priors for 3D reconstruction as input features, specifically in the context of depth estimation from stereo image pairs. We experiment on multiple datasets and achieve comparable or better results than state-of-the-art specialized architectures without introducing any architectural innovation. Instead, we propose powerful input-level 3D inductive biases that substantially improve data efficiency. This paper presents a new approach to problem solving in computer vision, where domain knowledge is applied as additional model inputs.
