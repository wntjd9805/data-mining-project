Image colorization techniques aim to generate color images from grayscale references, such as monochrome photos and line arts. While automatic methods exist for colorizing monochrome photos, colorizing line arts is more challenging due to their sparse structure lines and lack of ground truth colors. Previous line arts colorization methods require user-provided reference images or color hits to guide the results. Icons and comics are two common graphic designs that require colorization. Existing methods use sketch images as inputs and determine the color of each pixel to enhance color harmony and prevent color bleeding. However, colorizing icons is particularly challenging due to the presence of structure lines caused by color discontinuity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes an encoder-decoder network trained with supervised learning to map paired sketch images and style images to generate flat-color icons. We introduce a pixel-wise decoder, a global style code, and a contour loss to disentangle style and structure features, reduce color gradients, and increase color discontinuities at boundaries. Additionally, we train a continuous normalizing flow to sample diverse style codes conditioned on a given semantic style label. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
