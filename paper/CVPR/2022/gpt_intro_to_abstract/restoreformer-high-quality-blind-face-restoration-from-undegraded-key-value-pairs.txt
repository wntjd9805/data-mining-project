Blind face restoration is a challenging task that aims to restore a high-quality face from a degraded one that has suffered from various degradations. While some existing works focus on restoring faces based on the information in the degraded image alone, most of them have demonstrated that priors play a critical role in blind face restoration. These priors include geometric priors, reference priors, and generative priors. Geometric priors help reconstruct the facial structure by utilizing landmarks, facial parsing maps, or facial component heatmaps. Reference priors are based on high-quality exemplars or facial component dictionaries, while generative priors rely on well-trained high-quality face generators to generate a realistic face.Most existing methods combine the degraded face and priors using concatenation or spatial feature transformation. However, these approaches have limitations in capturing facial context and may lead to sub-optimal results. Therefore, this paper proposes RestoreFormer, a method that leverages fully-spatial attentions to globally model contextual information and transform the degraded face into a high-quality face close to the ground truth. Unlike existing methods that use multi-head self-attention, RestoreFormer introduces a multi-head cross-attention layer to incorporate the corrupted facial features with their corresponding high-quality priors.Additionally, this paper introduces a high-quality dictionary (HQ Dictionary) that is learned from undegraded faces. The HQ Dictionary is rich in high-quality facial details specifically aimed for face restoration, unlike previous component dictionaries that focus on specific face components such as eyes, nose, and mouth. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that RestoreFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces visually superior face restoration results.In summary, the main contributions of this paper are: 1) the proposal of RestoreFormer, which learns fully-spatial interactions between corrupted queries and high-quality key-value pairs for high-quality face restoration, 2) the development of a new HQ Dictionary that serves as priors in RestoreFormer and plays a critical role in face restoration, 3) extensive experiments showcasing the superior performance of RestoreFormer compared to existing methods in terms of visual quality and restoration accuracy.
