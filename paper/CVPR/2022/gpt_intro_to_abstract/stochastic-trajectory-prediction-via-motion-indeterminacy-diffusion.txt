Human trajectory prediction is a critical aspect of human-robot interaction systems such as self-driving vehicles and social robots. However, accurately predicting the future trajectories of pedestrians is challenging due to the multi-modality of human motion. Previous research has attempted to address this challenge by applying generative models to represent the multi-modal distribution of future trajectories. Despite the progress made, these methods still have limitations, such as instability in training process for generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the tendency of conditional variational auto-encoders (CVAEs) to produce unnatural trajectories. In this paper, we propose a new trajectory prediction framework called motion indeterminacy diffusion (MID), which models the indeterminacy of human behavior. Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, our framework treats future positions as particles that gather and deform to form a clear trajectory under low indeterminacy, while stochastically spreading over all walkable areas under high indeterminacy. We simulate the diffusion process by gradually adding noise to the trajectory, and our goal is to reverse this process and convert ambiguous prediction regions into a deterministic trajectory.We illustrate the reverse diffusion process of motion indeterminacy and propose a Markov chain-based model to represent this process. By adjusting the length of the chain, we can obtain predictions with flexible indeterminacy that can adapt to dynamic environments. Our method is more efficient to train than GANs and produces higher quality samples than CVAEs.To encode the history of human trajectories and social interactions, we utilize a spatial-temporal graph network. Temporal dependencies in trajectories are captured using a Transformer-based architecture as the core network of the MID framework. During training, we optimize the model using variational inference, and during inference, we sample reasonable trajectories by progressively denoising from a noise distribution. Experimental results on Stanford Drone and ETH/UCY datasets demonstrate the accuracy and multi-modality of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in human trajectory prediction benchmarks.In summary, our contributions include the development of a stochastic trajectory prediction framework that gradually discards indeterminacy to obtain desired trajectories, the design of a Transformer-based architecture to capture temporal dependencies, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in human trajectory prediction while balancing diversity and accuracy.
