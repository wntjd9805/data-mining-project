Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a technique used to reduce the cost of annotating pixel-level masks by using weak labels instead. Among the different types of weak labels, image-level class labels are the most economical yet challenging. The common pipeline for WSSS involves training a multi-label classification model, extracting class activation maps (CAMs) to generate masks, and using these masks as pseudo labels to train a fully-supervised segmentation model. However, the performance of the final segmentation model is often affected by flaws in the CAMs, such as false positive and false negative pixels. These flaws are particularly evident when using the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss with sigmoid activation function. In this paper, we empirically show the poor quality of CAMs when using BCE and propose a solution called ReCAM. ReCAM uses the softmax cross-entropy (SCE) loss as an additional loss to retrain the model and generate refined CAMs. We evaluate ReCAM on popular WSSS benchmarks and compare it with existing refinement methods. Our contributions include a simple yet effective method for generating pseudo masks in WSSS and extensive evaluations of ReCAM's performance.
