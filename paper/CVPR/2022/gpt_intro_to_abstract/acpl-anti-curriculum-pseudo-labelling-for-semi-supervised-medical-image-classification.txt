Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in medical image analysis (MIA), but the availability of labelled images is limited due to the high cost of expert labelling. This paper introduces the anti-curriculum pseudo-labelling (ACPL) approach to address the challenges of multi-class and multi-label imbalanced learning SSL MIA problems. ACPL includes a new method to select informative unlabelled images for pseudo-labelling, based on the distribution shift between unlabelled and labelled samples. This approach naturally balances the training process and eliminates the need for estimating class-wise thresholds. ACPL also introduces the informative mixup pseudo-labelling mechanism, which combines deep learning and K-nearest neighbor classification to improve prediction accuracy and mitigate confirmation bias. Additionally, the anchor set purification method is proposed to select informative pseudo-labelled samples for the labelled anchor set, enhancing the accuracy of the KNN classifier. ACPL is evaluated on two publicly available medical image classification datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both cases. This work contributes novel techniques for informative sample selection, pseudo-labelling, and anchor set purification, addressing imbalanced learning and improving classification accuracy in MIA.
