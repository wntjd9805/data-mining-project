In recent years, the advancement of face forgery generation methods has raised concerns regarding the potential misuse of deep learning techniques to create realistic fake facial images and videos. This has serious implications for political, social, and security issues. To combat this problem, effective detection methods must be developed. This paper introduces a novel framework called Reconstruction-Classification Learning (RECCE) for detecting face forgery. The RECCE framework focuses on learning representations that can generalize to unknown forgery patterns by exploring the common characteristics of genuine faces. It also aims to enhance the network's understanding of forgery cues through reconstruction and classification learning. The proposed framework includes a reconstruction network, bipartite graphs, and a multi-scale mechanism to capture forgery clues comprehensively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the RECCE framework compared to existing methods. Overall, this paper presents a promising approach to detecting face forgery and mitigating its potential consequences.
