Panoptic segmentation is a framework that combines semantic and instance segmentation to segment images into objects ("things") and uncountable concepts ("stuff"). While early approaches used separate modules for semantic and instance segmentation, recent architectures aim to process things and stuff together. However, these approaches do not consider the relations among semantic classes and instances, which is crucial for accurate panoptic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module that captures the relations among semantic classes and instances. PISR computes encodings for semantic classes and pivotal instances, automatically identifying which instances to focus on. It then applies attention to these encodings and global features to capture rich contextual relations. PISR can be used with any panoptic segmentation network and significantly enhances performance on multiple datasets. Our contributions include the proposal of PISR, a learnable scheme for focusing on important instances, and an extensive analysis of PISR through ablation studies. This is the first work to explicitly exploit relations among semantic classes and object instances for panoptic segmentation.
