Computer-aided design (CAD) plays a crucial role in modern architecture, engineering, and construction industries by generating digital illustrations of products. Understanding the content of CAD drawings, particularly the identification and recognition of symbols, is essential for various real-world industrial applications. Building information modeling (BIM), for instance, relies on accurate semantic and instance annotations extracted from CAD drawings to construct detailed floor plans. Traditional symbol spotting methods mostly focus on identifying instance symbols representing countable objects, but recent advancements have expanded this to include the recognition of semantic information for uncountable items, a concept known as panoptic symbol spotting. However, existing datasets for symbol spotting on floor plans are either synthetic or inaccurate. To address this limitation, Fan et al. developed the large-scale real-world FloorPlanCAD dataset, which contains over 10,000 floor plans with line-grained panoptic annotations. CAD drawings consist of abstract symbols that require strong domain-related knowledge for human perception. Representing CAD drawings as a graph of primitives has been proven effective for symbol spotting tasks. In this work, we present GAT-CADNet, a novel graph attention network designed to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem. Our network outperforms existing methods and makes several contributions, including formulating the instance symbol spotting task as a subgraph detection problem, incorporating relative spatial encoding to enhance vertex attention, and designing a cascaded edge encoding module to aggregate vertex attentions from multiple GAT stages.
