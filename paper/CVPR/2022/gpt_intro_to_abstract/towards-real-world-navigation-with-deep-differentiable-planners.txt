Continuous advances in robotics have led to the deployment of robots in various scenarios, ranging from manufacturing in factories to cleaning in households and the emerging applications of autonomous vehicles and delivery drones. Enhancing the autonomy of robots poses challenges due to the difficulty of planning from uncertain sensory data. Classical robotics focuses on planning using detailed knowledge of a robot's configuration and sensors, with little emphasis on learning from data. In contrast, deep learning provides a data-driven approach that excels at pattern recognition but does not directly address planning applications. One approach is to parse a scene into predefined elements and pass them to a classical planner. However, an end-to-end approach with all modules being learnable has the potential to improve with data and adapt to novel settings without manual tuning. Value Iteration Networks (VINs) emerged as a way to merge classical planning and data-driven deep networks by defining a differentiable planner. VINs allow for the inclusion of learnable elements, such as identifying and avoiding obstacles and recognizing and seeking target objects, without explicitly labeled examples. However, there are gaps between the idealized formulation of VINs and realistic robotics scenarios. This paper addresses these challenges and closes the gap between differentiable planners and realistic robot navigation applications. The contributions of this paper include a constrained transition model for value iteration that models illegal actions and task termination, a 3D state-space for embodied planning through the robot's translation and rotation, a trajectory reweighting scheme that addresses the unbalanced nature of navigation training distributions, and demonstrating that differentiable planners can learn to navigate in complex 3D mazes and the challenging Active Vision Dataset with images from a real robot platform. The method proposed in this paper can be trained with limited offline data, unlike prior work that required limitless data from a simulator. The related work and a brief introduction to differentiable planning are discussed in Sections 2 and 3, respectively, while the technical proposals and their evaluation are presented in Sections 4 and 5.
