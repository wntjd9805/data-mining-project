Long-tailed object detection is a challenging task that is receiving increased attention in the field of computer science. In this scenario, the data is typically distributed according to a Zipfian distribution, where a few classes dominate the training process with a large number of instances, while a significant number of tail classes have scarce instances and perform poorly. Common solutions to this problem include data resampling, decoupled training, and loss reweighting. However, most of these solutions are based on two-stage approaches, which are not as computationally efficient or easily deployable as one-stage detectors. One-stage detectors directly detect objects over a dense set of candidate locations, which introduces an extreme foreground-background imbalance. Combined with the imbalance among foreground categories in the long-tailed scenario, this severely degrades the performance of one-stage detectors. Focal loss has been proposed as a solution to the foreground-background imbalance problem, but it is inadequate for handling the imbalance among foreground categories in the long-tailed situation. Existing solutions adapted for two-stage detectors also only provide marginal improvements when applied to one-stage detectors.To address these issues, we propose Equalized Focal Loss (EFL), which introduces a category-relevant modulating factor into focal loss. This modulating factor, consisting of two decoupled dynamic factors (focusing factor and weighting factor), deals with the positive-negative imbalance of different categories independently. The focusing factor determines the concentration of learning on hard positive samples based on the imbalance degree of its corresponding category, while the weighting factor increases the impact of rare categories to ensure that their loss contribution is not overwhelmed by frequent ones. The synergy of these two factors allows EFL to overcome the foreground-background imbalance and the imbalance among foreground categories in one-stage long-tailed detectors.We evaluate EFL on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark and achieve 29.2% average precision (AP), surpassing all existing long-tailed object detection methods. Experimental results on the OpenImages dataset also demonstrate the generalization ability of our method. Our key contributions include being the first to study one-stage long-tailed object detection, proposing EFL as a novel extension of focal loss that addresses both foreground-background and foreground categories imbalance, and establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-tailed object detection that can be applied to any one-stage detector.
