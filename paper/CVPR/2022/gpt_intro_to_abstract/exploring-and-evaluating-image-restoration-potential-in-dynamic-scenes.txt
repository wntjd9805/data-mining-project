In real-world imaging scenarios, degradation often occurs due to dynamic motions or shaking devices, resulting in blurred images. To address this issue, photographers can shorten exposure times, but this often leads to low illumination regions and noise artifacts. Different types of distortion may occur, necessitating different image restoration algorithms, such as deblurring or denoising methods. However, it is unclear which type of distorted input leads to better restored results. While most research focuses on developing restoration algorithms, few studies evaluate the relationship between input images and restored quality. In this paper, we propose the concept of image restoration potential (IRP), which measures the inherent value of an image for restoration. We demonstrate that traditional image quality metrics do not necessarily correlate with restored results, highlighting the need for the IRP concept. We establish a dynamic scene imaging dataset and apply various restoration algorithms to investigate IRP. We also analyze the key factors affecting IRP and develop a deep model for accurate IRP prediction. Additionally, we explore the applications of IRP, including filtering valuable frames, guiding restoration models, and optimizing camera settings. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of IRP as a criterion for measuring image potential for restoration, the development of a deep model for IRP prediction, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of IRP in various image restoration-related applications.
