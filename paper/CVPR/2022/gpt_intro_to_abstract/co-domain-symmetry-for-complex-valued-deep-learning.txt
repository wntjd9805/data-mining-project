Symmetry is a powerful tool in deep learning, as it simplifies the learning process by capturing structured variations in natural data. While previous research has focused on transformations defined on the domain of an image, such as scaling and rotations, co-domain transformations remain under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the exploitation of co-domain symmetry in complex-valued data. Complex-valued models have shown benefits over real-valued models in various applications, and we aim to identify the symmetries inherent in complex-valued data and leverage them in deep learning models. Specifically, we explore the complex-scale ambiguity in complex-valued data, where a complex-valued signal can be subject to global magnitude scaling and phase offset. We propose a deep learning method that preserves co-domain symmetry and demonstrate its effectiveness in complex-valued data classification tasks. Our method achieves high accuracy, better generalization, and robustness to co-domain transformations while using fewer parameters compared to existing methods. We also introduce a complex-valued encoding of color that automatically leads to color distortion robustness without the need for additional augmentation techniques. Experimental results on various datasets validate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.
