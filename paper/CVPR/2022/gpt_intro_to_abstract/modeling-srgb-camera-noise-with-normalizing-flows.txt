Modeling and reducing noise in computer vision and image processing have been extensively studied. While simple models like additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) have been commonly used for testing denoising methods, they are not realistic representations of real-world camera noise. More sophisticated models such as Poisson-Gaussian or Heteroscedastic Gaussian have been developed to better capture the noise distribution observed on camera sensors. However, these models still fall short in fully capturing real camera noise distributions.In recent years, data-driven noise models have emerged, focusing on learning the noise distribution directly from large datasets of noisy sensor images. These approaches aim to model the noise present in the raw sensor images, which is valuable as denoising algorithms are typically applied in the camera's image signal processor (ISP) hardware. However, noise reduction in the RAW-rgb domain may not be sufficient in scenarios where in-camera denoising is disabled or unavailable, and most cameras typically save images in the sRGB format.Rendering noisy sensor images through the camera's ISP, including the application of complex, nonlinear operations during photo-finishing, introduces a more complex noise distribution in the final sRGB representation compared to the unprocessed RAW-rgb space. Existing RAW-rgb-focused noise models are ineffective in modeling sRGB noise due to these alterations.In this paper, our focus is on modeling and synthesizing sRGB image noise, taking into account the nonlinear processing and alterations introduced by the camera's ISP. We analyze existing noise models targeting sensor noise in the RAW-rgb domain and demonstrate their limitations in modeling sRGB images. To address this, we propose a generative model that combines advancements in normalizing flows to capture the effects of different gain (ISO) settings and camera types on sRGB image noise.We evaluate our sRGB noise model against several baseline noise models and show its superiority. Additionally, we investigate the ability of our model to synthesize noise by training a denoiser using noisy images sampled from our model. Results indicate significant performance improvements compared to denoisers trained on synthesized data from baseline models.In summary, this paper contributes a novel sRGB-focused noise model that accounts for the alterations introduced by the camera's ISP. The proposed model outperforms existing models and demonstrates improved denoising performance.
