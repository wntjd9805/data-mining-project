Graph neural networks (GNN) have gained significant attention for their effectiveness in handling graph-structured data. However, in real-world scenarios, graph data is often dynamic and streaming, presenting the need for learning techniques that can handle evolving graphs. This paper addresses this need by extending GNN to lifelong learning, also known as continual or incremental learning. Lifelong learning aims to mitigate "catastrophic forgetting," which occurs when models are updated with new samples and tend to forget previously learned knowledge. While strategies have been developed to address this issue in convolutional neural networks (CNN), they cannot be directly applied to GNN due to the increasing graph size and the need to drop old data to save memory. In this paper, we propose a solution by introducing a novel graph topology called feature graph. Feature graph converts node classification into graph classification, allowing nodes to be predicted independently and enabling the adoption of lifelong learning techniques for GNN. We model feature "interaction" through the cross-correlation of neighbor features, which proves crucial for many graph-structured tasks. The feature graph has constant computational complexity even with increased learning tasks, making it efficient and effective for handling evolving graph data. The paper demonstrates the superiority of feature graph in various applications, including distributed human action recognition and feature matching. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the introduction of the concept of feature graph, the explicit modeling of feature interactions, and the demonstration of its efficiency and effectiveness in different graph-based tasks.
