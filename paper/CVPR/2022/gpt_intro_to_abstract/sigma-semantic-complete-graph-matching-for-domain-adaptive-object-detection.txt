This paper introduces the SemantIc-complete Graph MAtching (SIGMA) framework for Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (DAOD). Well-trained object detectors have shown promising performance, but their performance degrades when applied in novel domains due to the domain gap. To address this limitation, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been explored, particularly those that align feature distributions between source and target domains. However, existing category-level adaptation works neglect the within-class variance and mismatched semantics within the training batch. To overcome these challenges, SIGMA leverages graph matching theory to align class-conditional distributions. It introduces a Graph-embedded Semantic Completion module (GSC) for completing mismatched semantics by generating hallucination nodes, and a Bipartite Graph Matching adaptor (BGM) to reformulate DAOD as a graph matching problem. Experimental results demonstrate that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing DAOD methods.
