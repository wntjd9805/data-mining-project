In recent years, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have greatly advanced visual object detection. However, these CNNs require large amounts of annotated data and bounding-box labels for training, which is expensive and time-consuming. Active learning is a promising alternative that aims to reduce this cost by selectively labeling informative samples. In the field of computer vision, active learning has mostly been discussed in the context of image classification, with methods falling into two categories: uncertainty-based and diversity-based. Uncertainty-based methods select informative samples based on their ambiguities, while diversity-based methods focus on selecting samples that represent the entire data distribution. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses, and there is a trend to combine them as hybrid methods. However, active learning for object detection, which involves both object category and location, is more complex. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid approach that considers both uncertainty and diversity at the instance level. Our approach works in two stages: in the first stage, we estimate the uncertainty of each image using a method called Entropy-based Non-Maximum Suppression (ENMS); in the second stage, we introduce a diverse prototype (DivProto) strategy to ensure instance-level diversity across images. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results.
