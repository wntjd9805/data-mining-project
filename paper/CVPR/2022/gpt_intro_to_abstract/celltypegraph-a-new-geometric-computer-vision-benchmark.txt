Understanding the process of morphogenesis, or the generation of form, has long been a challenge in biology. To decipher this complex mechanism, a detailed quantitative description of the molecular and cellular processes is required. In recent years, the use of 3D digital organs with cellular spatial resolution has shown promise in unraveling the morphogenesis of complex organs in plants. These digital organs are generated through 3D microscopic imaging, followed by cell instance segmentation and tissue annotation. Plant organs are particularly suitable for this approach due to their well-structured, layered organization and the ability to identify tissues based on their positions and morphology. However, automatic annotation of different tissue types within plant organs remains a major problem, especially for organs with complex cellular architecture and shape. Similar challenges have been addressed in medical image analysis, specifically the segmentation of whole-body scans, using 3D encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. However, this approach is not as effective for images of plant organs, as the semantic classes lack distinctive local and texture features that are helpful for CNN-based architectures. Instead, the task requires long-range spatial awareness and good geometrical reasoning. In response to this, the problem is formulated as a node classification task, where informative input features are crucial for successful classification. The authors propose a cell-adjacency graph with cell-level features as a powerful representation for this task.The primary intent of this work is twofold. Firstly, it aims to provide a testing ground for machine learning on highly structured input, combining node classification with geo-referenced graphs. Secondly, it seeks to engage the computer vision and machine learning community in solving this fascinating biological problem by providing a benchmark dataset, source code, and usage instructions. The authors present extensive experiments evaluating the performance of state-of-the-art and popular models on the benchmark dataset. In summary, the contributions of this paper include proposing a new benchmark for node classification in a geo-referenced graph, providing a ready-to-use data loader for the benchmark dataset, conducting comparative experiments using state-of-the-art graph neural networks and studying feature relevance. The authors also provide an extensive set of precomputed features and an additional set of ground truth labels.
