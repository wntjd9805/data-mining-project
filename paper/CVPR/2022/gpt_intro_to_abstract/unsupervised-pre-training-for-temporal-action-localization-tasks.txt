This paper introduces the concept of unsupervised pre-training for temporal action localization (TAL) tasks in computer vision. The authors argue that the current practice of pre-training on temporal action classification (TAC) data is sub-optimal due to the inherent discrepancy between TAC and TAL. To address this, the authors propose a new unsupervised learning paradigm called Pseudo Action Localization (PAL). PAL involves constructing a training set by transforming existing TAC data to mimic TAL-tailored data with temporal boundaries. The model is trained to align and discriminate between pseudo action features in synthesized videos. The authors also introduce a time-equivariant contrastive learning paradigm to enhance feature robustness and achieve equivariance required for TAL. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that PAL transfers well to TAL-related tasks and outperforms supervised pre-training methods. This work represents the first attempt at unsupervised pre-training for TAL tasks. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of PAL and the demonstration of its effectiveness in TAL.
