This paper introduces a method called visual vibration tomography, which estimates material properties of objects directly from vibration signals extracted from monocular video. While non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques have focused on identifying defects in structures, this method aims to determine the spatial distribution of physical properties in objects with a heterogeneous interior structure.The paper begins by discussing the advantages of using video as a measurement tool, such as offering spatially dense measurements of surface vibrations and being more accessible and versatile compared to existing NDT techniques like contact sensors and laser vibrometers. The authors also highlight that their method can work with just a monocular view, eliminating the need for stereo cameras for 3D motion tracking.The key insight behind the proposed method is that an object's material properties determine its motion, and vice versa. By decomposing small motions into independent modes at natural frequencies, a link is established between these modes and material properties, enabling a physics-constrained optimization approach.The paper reviews related work and the theoretical relationship between modes and material properties, and then explains how image-space modes can be extracted from video and used to recover material properties. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through simulated data experiments on 3D geometries, considering damping and model mismatch. They also present proof-of-concept experiments on real data, showcasing the imaging of material inhomogeneities on drum heads and the detection of defects in a 3D Jello cube.Overall, this paper presents a promising approach for estimating material properties using visual vibration tomography, with potential applications in various challenging environments.
