This paper introduces a new paradigm called weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) for medical image segmentation. WSSS utilizes weak annotations such as image-level labels to train a model without the need for expensive and time-consuming pixel-level labels. The main challenge for WSSS with image-level labels is the lack of location information. Existing methods based on class activation mapping (CAM) have been proposed to address this issue but may not work well on medical images. Medical images present unique challenges for WSSS, including ambiguous object boundaries and severe co-occurrence of different organs in the same image. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal CAM (C-CAM) method that integrates two causality chains: category causality and anatomy causality. C-CAM generates pseudo segmentation masks with clearer boundaries and more accurate shapes. The effectiveness of C-CAM is demonstrated through experiments on three public medical image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach for weakly supervised semantic segmentation in medical images by introducing causality into the process.
