Traditional single-granularity classification assigns a single label to an object from a set of mutually exclusive class labels. However, this approach has limitations due to differences in domain knowledge and variations in image resolutions. Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to distinguish objects from different subordinate-level categories within a given object category, but defining what is considered fine-grained is subjective and image quality can affect identification. To address these challenges, a more preferable solution is to employ hierarchical multi-granularity labels, which provide more flexible options for annotators with different knowledge backgrounds. This paper focuses on hierarchical multi-granularity classification (HMC) problem where samples are labeled at any level of the hierarchy. The goal is to effectively utilize instances labeled at different levels and perform hierarchical feature interaction in the network architecture. To achieve this, a tree hierarchy is used to define parent-child correlations and mutual exclusion relationships between labels. Marginalization is employed to learn from coarse-level and fine-level labels, enhancing the discriminative power among fine-grained categories. Hierarchical residual network (HRN) is proposed to capture the hierarchical features and interactions between different levels. The paper also introduces class relabeling, image degeneration, and two evaluation metrics in the experimental setting. Experimental results on three FGVC datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art HMC approaches.
