Abstract:This paper introduces an alternative approach to scene modeling called deterministic integration for volume rendering (DIVeR), which competes with state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Existing methods, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and PlenOctrees, use stochastic integrators which suffer from accuracy issues when rendering translucent objects. In contrast, DIVeR utilizes a deterministic integrator that directly estimates the section of the volume rendering integral, resulting in more accurate models with fewer sampling calls. The proposed method employs a voxel-based representation with per-voxel feature vectors and a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) to compute the deterministic integrator estimate. The model is trained using gradient descent to minimize prediction error and rendered by querying the resulting structure with new rays. Experimental results show that DIVeR is efficient to train, produces small models, and achieves comparable Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) with state-of-the-art NeRF models.
