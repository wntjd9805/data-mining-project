JPEG is a popular image compression algorithm used widely in data centers, cloud storage, and network filesystems. However, most JPEG images are not sufficiently compressed due to the limitations of the algorithm. While newer compression methods exist, they focus on compressing original images in lossless formats and ignore the need to further compress existing JPEG images. Existing recompression methods for JPEG images rely on hand-crafted features and independently optimized modules, limiting their efficiency. With the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing storage needs, existing JPEG recompression algorithms are not expected to be optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose an efficient JPEG image lossless recompression neural network that uses quantized DCT coefficients as input. This is the first work dedicated to deep learning-based lossless recompression of JPEG images and outperforms existing traditional methods by a large margin. Our method considers JPEG images in YCbCr 4:2:0 format and constructs a color-space entropy model to extract side information and build conditional distributions. We also exploit the correlation of the Y, Cb, and Cr components to improve compression efficiency. Additionally, we propose a Multi-Level Cross-Channel (MLCC) entropy enhancement model for the Y component to reduce the mismatch between estimated and true data distribution.Our contributions include proposing an end-to-end lossless compression model for JPEG images and achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods such as Lepton, JPEG XL, and CMIX. Our model also has reasonable running speed, making it a promising candidate for practical JPEG recompression.
