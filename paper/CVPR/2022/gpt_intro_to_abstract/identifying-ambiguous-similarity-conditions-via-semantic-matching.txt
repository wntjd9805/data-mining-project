Learning embeddings from data is beneficial for machine learning and visual recognition systems. Triplets, which indicate the comparison relationship between objects, are commonly used in creating embeddings. However, the measurement of similarity from different perspectives can result in ambiguous relationships. To address this issue, Conditional Similarity Learning (CSL) has been proposed to learn multiple embeddings based on different similarity conditions. While supervised CSL requires explicit condition labels, Weakly Supervised-CSL (WS-CSL) aims to learn embeddings without knowledge of the corresponding conditions. However, the evaluation protocol used in WS-CSL neglects the specified condition, leading to biased results. To address this challenge, we propose a novel criterion and introduce the Distance Induced Semantic COndition VERification Network (DISCOVERNET). DISCOVERNET balances the ability of comparison prediction and semantic coverage by identifying similarity conditions and capturing the ambiguous relationships with discriminative embeddings. Our approach outperforms existing WS-CSL methods and improves the quality of learned embeddings. Additionally, DISCOVERNET can identify latent rich conditions and achieve better performance based on our proposed criterion.
