In recent years, object detection has experienced significant development, with the emergence of numerous benchmark datasets and methods. However, the need for expensive instance-level annotation has hindered the progress and practical application of existing detection models. Therefore, finding ways to reduce labeling costs has become a research focus in object detection.One approach that has shown promise in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) is teacher-student learning, inspired by its success in image classification. This methodology involves using a teacher network with weakly augmented labeled data to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for a student network with strong data augmentation. Sohn et al. proposed the STAC framework, which outperformed existing semi-supervised methods by a large margin.Recent works have aimed to improve this teacher-student methodology, addressing issues such as class-imbalance, overfitting, and the quality of pseudo-labels. However, these optimizations are unrelated to the focus of our proposed method.In this paper, we investigate the selection of optimal labeled examples for teacher-student learning in SSOD. Despite generating pseudo-labels through self-training, ground-truth label information still plays a crucial role in the initial training phase. We observe that while some teacher-student methods utilize pseudo-labels for object category predictions and foreground-background proposals, they still rely on ground-truth annotations for bounding box regression.To address this, we propose a new teacher-student method called Active Teacher. This method extends the conventional framework to an iterative one, where the label set is partially initialized and gradually augmented using a novel active sampling strategy. By actively sampling data, Active Teacher maximizes the impact of limited label information and improves the quality of pseudo-labels.We conduct extensive experiments on the MS COCO benchmark dataset to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate the significant performance gains of Active Teacher compared to state-of-the-art SSOD methods. Additionally, Active Teacher enables the baseline detection network to achieve 100% supervised performance with substantially less labeling expenditure.In summary, our contributions include the first exploration of data initialization in teacher-student based SSOD, providing useful references for data annotation in practical applications. We also propose the Active Teacher framework, which outperforms existing methods and reduces the cost of labeling in object detection.
