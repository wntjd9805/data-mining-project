This paper introduces the research areas of depth reconstruction and hyperspectral reflectance reconstruction (spectral reconstruction) in the fields of computer vision and image processing. The goal of depth reconstruction is to obtain a scene's depth map, while spectral reconstruction aims to acquire a scene's spectral reflectance information. The simultaneous acquisition of depth and spectral reflectance, known as hyperspectral-depth reconstruction, has various potential applications. Previous systems have focused on separately acquiring depth and spectral reflectance or have utilized expensive hyperspectral cameras. This paper proposes a novel single-shot system using a standard RGB camera and an off-the-shelf RGB projector. The system employs a random color-dot projection, which serves as structured light for depth reconstruction and spatially-varying color illuminations for spectral reconstruction. The unique code pattern and distinct RGB color illuminations provided by the random color dots are used to reconstruct the hyperspectral-depth information.To effectively reconstruct the depth and spectral reflectance from a single color-dot image, the paper proposes a novel end-to-end deep learning method. This method jointly learns the depth and spectral reflectance by considering the geometric warping of the color-dot pattern, improving the accuracy of each other. Additionally, a spectral renderer is developed to generate a synthetic dataset for constructing a real-world hyperspectral-depth dataset.The main contributions of this work include the proposal of the first single-shot hyperspectral-depth reconstruction system using a standard RGB camera and off-the-shelf RGB projector, as well as the introduction of a novel network architecture and end-to-end learning method. Experimental validation is performed on both synthetic and real-world scenes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
