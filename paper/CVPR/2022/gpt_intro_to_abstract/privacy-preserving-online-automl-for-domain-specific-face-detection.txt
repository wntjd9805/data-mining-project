Face detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision, but there is still a high demand for bespoke face detection models for domain-specific scenarios. Different challenges arise in detecting faces from outdoor surveillance cameras, panoramic indoor fisheye cameras, occluded faces, and selfie faces. Building specialized models for each domain requires extensive manual parameter tuning and large computing resources. To address this, there is a need for a shared AI model training platform that leverages pretrained representations from related tasks. Existing AutoML tools either compromise data privacy or require tuning from scratch for new scenarios. This paper introduces HyperFD, a privacy-preserving online AutoML paradigm for face detection. Instead of uploading raw images, each client only sends dataset-level representations (meta-features) to the platform and requests the best configuration, including network architecture and hyperparameters. A learnable performance ranker selects top-k optimal configurations based on the dataset meta-features. The face detector is then trained locally on each client, protecting the privacy of training data. HyperFD differs from traditional federated learning as it conducts local training tasks without global aggregation. To improve generalizability and leverage previous tasks' experience, a novel meta-feature transformation module is integrated. This module builds a mapping between the current meta-feature space and previous feature space, allowing historical tasks to influence the ranking of configurations for new tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of HyperFD, and a benchmark and source code are provided to facilitate future research.
