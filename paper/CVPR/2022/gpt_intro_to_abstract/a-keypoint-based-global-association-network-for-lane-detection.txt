Autonomous driving has become a topic of great interest in both academia and industry. One crucial aspect of ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles is accurate lane detection. In this paper, we propose a new approach to lane detection that directly regresses each keypoint to its corresponding lane. This global association perspective allows for more efficient and flexible lane detection compared to previous methods. We also introduce a Lane-aware Feature Aggregator (LFA) module to enhance correlations between adjacent keypoints and incorporate local information. Our proposed method, Global Association Network (GANet), achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior efficiency and accuracy in lane detection for autonomous driving applications.
