This paper introduces a general neural trajectory prior for estimating 3D trajectories in dynamic scenes. Previous works in the Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM) field have handcrafted trajectory priors to solve the problem of lifting 2D points to 3D. However, these priors lack sufficient constraints to disambiguate camera and point motion. In this study, the authors propose a neural runtime optimization approach to model a general and dataless prior for estimating 3D trajectories.The authors utilize the smoothness bias of coordinate multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to enforce trajectories to be temporally smooth and encourage nearby positions to share similar motions. They also introduce a bottleneck layer to the model to constrain the output trajectories to be compressible to low dimensions. By leveraging the architectural regularization properties of neural networks, the authors achieve greater expressibility and accuracy compared to low-rank linear models.The proposed neural trajectory prior is not limited to NRSfM problems. The authors demonstrate its applicability to estimating long-term scene flow from lidar point clouds. They integrate sparse 3D lidar points across multiple frames, addressing the challenges of dealing with dynamic scenes and unstructured lidar signals. The neural trajectory prior effectively regularizes scene flow integration both spatially and temporally, outperforming naive Euler-based integration methods.The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) The proposal of a general neural trajectory prior that uses a bottleneck architecture and coordinate MLPs to regularize trajectories and spatio-temporal dependencies, respectively.2) Validation of the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory prior by achieving competitive results with NRSfM methods that use both shape and trajectory priors.3) Demonstration of the applicability of the trajectory prior to achieve state-of-the-art results across sparse NRSfM benchmarks and outperform a recently proposed neural-based method on dense NRSfM benchmarks while being significantly faster.4) Improvement of lidar scene flow integration by modeling spatio-temporal information using the neural trajectory prior, outperforming naive pairwise flow integration methods.Overall, the proposed neural trajectory prior offers a general and dataless approach for estimating 3D trajectories, providing longer-term information about the dynamics of a 3D scene and enabling agnostic solutions to low-level vision tasks.
