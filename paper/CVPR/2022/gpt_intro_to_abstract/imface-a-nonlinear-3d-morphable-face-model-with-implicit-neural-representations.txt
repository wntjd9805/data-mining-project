3D Morphable Face Models (3DMMs) are widely used statistical models that aim to generate realistic faces with desired variations. These models have been extensively applied in various fields such as computer vision, computer graphics, biometrics, and medical imaging. Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in the generation of morphable representations using linear and multilinear models. However, these models have limitations in handling complex variations, particularly with exaggerated expressions. In recent years, nonlinear models based on deep learning techniques have been explored using 2D images or 3D meshes. While these models have shown performance gains, they often fail to capture facial priors due to the discrete representation strategies on input data, resulting in a loss of shape details. Additionally, current methods heavily rely on point-to-point correspondence, making face registration challenging. Recently, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach to accurately model 3D geometries by learning continuous deep implicit functions. INRs offer advantages over discrete representations by providing superior shape reconstruction and surface registration. However, current INR methods face difficulties in facial modeling due to the complex deformations caused by multiple identities and rich expressions. Facial surfaces also pose challenges for implicit functions as they require watertight input. To address these challenges, this paper proposes ImFace, a novel 3D face morphable model that incorporates INRs. ImFace explicitly disentangles shape morphs into two deformation fields for identity and expression, allowing accurate modeling of inter-individual differences and fine-grained deformations. The paper also introduces a new preprocessing pipeline that bypasses the limitations of watertight face data, enabling ImFace to work effectively with various facial surfaces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ImFace synthesizes high-quality 3D faces with plausible details, outperforming state-of-the-art models in 3D face reconstruction. In summary, the contributions of this paper include the proposal of an INR-based 3DMM that encodes complex face shape variations, the development of an effective preprocessing pipeline for non-watertight 3D faces, and the demonstration of ImFace's superiority in synthesizing high-quality 3D faces.
