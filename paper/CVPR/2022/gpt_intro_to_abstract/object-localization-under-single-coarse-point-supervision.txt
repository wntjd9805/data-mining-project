In this computer science paper, the authors explore point-based object localization (POL) and the challenges associated with annotation. They discuss the need for high-quality densely annotated data, which is expensive and difficult to obtain. They introduce the concept of point-based object localization (POL) as an alternative approach that requires point-level annotations rather than bounding boxes. However, they highlight the problem of multiple candidate points during annotation, which creates ambiguity and confusion for the model during training. Previous works have addressed this issue by setting strict annotation rules, but they suffer from challenges such as defining key points, dealing with varying poses and views, and deciding the appropriate granularity of key points. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the coarse point-based localization (CPL) paradigm, which involves a coarse point annotation strategy and a coarse point refinement (CPR) algorithm. The CPR algorithm aims to refine the annotated coarse points to semantic centers, reducing semantic variance and increasing tolerance for prediction errors. The authors present the contributions of their work, which include extending previous POL methods to a multi-class/multi-scale task, proposing the CPR algorithm to alleviate semantic variance, demonstrating the effectiveness of CPR in experiments, and introducing a new dataset called SeaPerson for tiny person detection and localization.
