The ability to semantically segment 3D shapes is important for various applications in vision, graphics, and robotics. These applications require fine-scale and hierarchically-organized parts. Current approaches in 3D shape semantic segmentation focus on end-to-end methods using shape atoms as the lowest-level geometric entity. However, these methods do not transfer well to domains with fine-grained labels or limited labeled data. This paper proposes the Neurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP) as a method to assign fine-grained labels to regions of a 3D shape. NGSP uses maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference and a mixture of modules to evaluate label assignments based on geometry, spatial layout, and groups of regions. A neural guide network approximates the posterior to sample proposed label assignments. NGSP achieves the best semantic segmentation performance compared to alternative methods, even in limited or noisy labeled data scenarios. An ablation study validates the design decisions, and the performance of NGSP is evaluated on CAD shapes and compared against other methods. The contributions of this paper are the introduction of NGSP and its superior performance in fine-grained semantic segmentation.
