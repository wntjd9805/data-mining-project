This paper introduces a novel approach to modeling road networks for autonomous driving. The authors propose to represent the road network using a set of Bezier curves that capture both the direction of traffic flow and the topology of the intersections. They argue that preserving the order of intersections is crucial for maintaining the topological consistency of the road network. To achieve this, they introduce the concept of minimal cycles and their covers, and measure the equivalence between different road network estimations based on the covers of these cycles. The authors train a deep neural network to predict the lane curves, their connections, and the minimal cycles with their covers from a single onboard image. The model is trained using joint supervision, where the predicted curves and covers are matched to the ground truth using the Hungarian algorithm. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing methods in terms of topological accuracy and traditional structure metrics. They also highlight the importance of directly predicting the road network in the Birds-Eye-View (BEV) for online mapping in autonomous driving, as opposed to projecting the output from the image plane to the ground plane. Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive study on estimating the topology of a road network and provides a valuable contribution to the field of computer vision for autonomous driving.
