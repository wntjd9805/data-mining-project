Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise in computer vision applications but are limited by the need for large labeled datasets. Real-world objects follow long-tailed distributions, making visual data from the real world unavailable for training DNNs. To address this, generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) models have been developed to generalize to unseen classes. However, these models are not designed for dynamic addition of object categories, limiting their applicability. This paper introduces the concept of continual generalized zero-shot learning (CGZSL) and proposes a flexible Online-CGZSL setting that closely resembles real-world scenarios. The authors propose a feature-generative framework with a bi-directional incremental alignment-based replay strategy to adapt to new classes without storing samples from previous tasks. Experimental results show the promise of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets. This work contributes by consolidating and defining the different CGZSL settings, establishing a practical Online-CGZSL setting, proposing a novel feature-generative framework, and demonstrating improved performance compared to existing approaches.
