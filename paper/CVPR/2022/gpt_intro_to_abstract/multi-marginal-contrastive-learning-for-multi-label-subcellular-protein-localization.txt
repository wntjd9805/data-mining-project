Abstract:Protein subcellular localization (PSL) plays a crucial role in understanding protein functions and identifying disease pathology. Traditional methods for PSL recognition, such as wet-lab approaches, are time-consuming and expensive. As a result, machine learning techniques have been applied to automate PSL recognition. This paper focuses on PSL recognition using immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, which provide spatial expression information of proteins. We propose a deep learning algorithm called DeePSLoc, which leverages downsampled images and cropped patches to capture both global and local features of IHC images. Additionally, we introduce a multi-marginal contrastive learning mechanism in DeePSLoc to enhance the discriminative ability of features. By generating contrastive pairs using attention mechanism, our method effectively accounts for the morphological and subcellular differences in tissue samples. Experiments demonstrate that DeePSLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both single- and multi-label datasets. This paper presents a novel framework for PSL recognition in IHC images and contributes to the advancement of machine learning techniques in the field of protein biology.
