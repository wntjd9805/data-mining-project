Thermal infrared imaging is widely used in various applications such as human temperature measurement and safety monitoring. It offers unique advantages such as the ability to work in the dark, energy-saving operation, and the ability to measure temperature information. However, the security of deep learning-based infrared object detection systems has become a concern due to the threat of adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are perturbed data that can cause deep learning models to output incorrect results with high confidence. While most research focuses on adversarial examples in the visible light field, this paper specifically addresses the security of thermal infrared object detection systems. Traditional methods of infrared stealth, such as heat insulation and active cooling, are not foolproof, as the human body naturally emits thermal infrared signals. Therefore, the paper proposes a new method using adversarial clothing to deceive infrared detectors. The goal is to design clothing with specific textures that can deceive detectors from different angles and can withstand non-rigid deformation. The paper presents the design of adversarial patterns, the manufacturing of infrared adversarial clothing using aerogel material, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in physical experiments. The contributions of this paper include the simulation and design of adversarial patterns in the digital world and the development of infrared adversarial clothing that can successfully deceive infrared detectors at multiple angles.
