In recent years, there has been significant progress in learning-based methods for various perception tasks, such as object detection and segmentation. However, in safety-critical scenarios like autonomous driving, ensuring the robustness and generalization of these models becomes crucial. One challenge is the presence of out-of-domain data, which can occur naturally in the real world and can lead to failures in the models. While several works have addressed this issue in the imaging domain, the exploration of out-of-domain data in 3D point clouds is still limited due to the inherent challenges of point clouds.In this paper, we focus on improving the generalization capability of 3D object detectors to out-of-domain data by introducing a novel adversarial augmentation method called 3D-VField. This method leverages the concept of vector fields to deform point clouds during training, preserving the overall object shape while altering the positions of points along the view ray. Unlike existing adversarial deformation strategies, our approach is sample-independent and sensor-aware, making it widely applicable and more effective in improving model robustness. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we introduce the CrashD dataset, which contains damaged and rare cars as natural adversarial examples. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets, including KITTI, Waymo, CrashD, and SUN RGB-D, demonstrating the wide applicability of our approach. Our results show that 3D-VField significantly improves the generalization of 3D object detectors to out-of-domain samples, highlighting the importance of considering these corner cases in safety-critical settings.In summary, our contributions include raising awareness of natural adversarial examples and their impact on 3D object detectors, proposing a novel and effective adversarial augmentation method based on vector fields, and introducing the publicly available CrashD dataset. Our approach shows promising results and paves the way for further improving the robustness of learning-based models in critical scenarios.
