Alignment of 3D scans, known as Point Cloud Registration (PCR), is crucial in various applications, including Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), augmented reality, and robotics. Traditional approaches first establish feature correspondences and then estimate the 3D rotation and translation for alignment. However, challenges such as partial overlap and feature ambiguity often lead to outliers in the correspondences, resulting in inaccurate alignment. This paper proposes a new global measure of similarity between correspondences, called second order spatial compatibility (SC2). By computing the number of commonly compatible correspondences in the global set, SC2 better distinguishes inliers from outliers. The proposed method has several advantages, including easier distinction of inliers from outliers, improved efficiency and robustness in model estimation, and reduced probability of wrong sampling. A full pipeline for point cloud registration, called SC2-PCR, is designed based on the SC2 measure. Compared to existing methods, SC2-PCR offers a second order metric that enhances robustness, is lightweight and does not require training, and is applicable in various scenarios. The proposed method can also be plugged into other deep learning frameworks, such as PointDSC, to produce even better results.
