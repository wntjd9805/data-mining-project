Estimating the 6D object pose is crucial for various real-time applications, including augmented reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to the development of pose estimation methods based on RGB-D data. While the fusion of RGB and point cloud features in RGB-D-based methods has shown robustness in handling occlusion and textureless situations, their regression-based approaches struggle with symmetric objects and lack computational efficiency for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a more efficient RGB-D-based 6D pose regression framework specifically designed for symmetric objects.Our framework includes a novel feature extraction network called XYZNet, which is significantly more computationally efficient than previous methods. XYZNet extracts features from RGB and point cloud data through a fully convolutional network, known as the XYZ map. This map retains spatial information and allows for simultaneous feature extraction with 2D convolutional kernels. Additionally, we utilize a CNN-based PointNet module to encode point cloud data with local features, which are then aggregated with RGB features. Experimental results confirm the superiority of XYZNet over existing methods.We also address the challenges posed by symmetric objects in learning-based approaches. We introduce a novel shape representation called grouped primitives (GP) that only considers the proper symmetries of objects. By categorizing symmetric objects into five categories, we develop a distance metric called the average (maximum) grouped primitives distance (A(M)GPD) to accurately assess pose distance in the 3D metric space. A numerical simulation and visualization method validate the effectiveness of A(M)GPD in handling symmetric objects.Lastly, we evaluate our proposed framework, ES6D, on the YCB-Video and T-LESS datasets to demonstrate its superior performance in terms of both speed and accuracy. The key contributions of our work include XYZNet, a computationally efficient feature extraction network, the introduction of GP and A(M)GPD to handle symmetries in pose estimation, and a numerical simulation and visualization method to analyze the validity of A(M)GPD. Overall, our framework achieves competitive performance in 6D pose estimation.
