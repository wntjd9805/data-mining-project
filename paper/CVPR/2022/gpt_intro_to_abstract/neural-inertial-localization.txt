This paper addresses the gap in technology that maps a motion history obtained from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to a location. The goal is to introduce a new paradigm in localization research called "inertial localization", which aims to infer the location from a sequence of IMU sensor data. Indoor localization is a crucial technology for various applications, but current systems mostly rely on WiFi infrastructure, which may not scale easily to non-commercial private spaces. IMU, on the other hand, is a powerful complementary modality to WiFi, as it works anytime anywhere, is energy efficient, and protects bystander privacy. This paper introduces the first inertial localization benchmark, consisting of 53 hours of motion data and ground-truth locations over 3 buildings. It also proposes an effective solution called neural inertial localization (NILoc), which utilizes a neural inertial navigation technique to convert IMU sensor data into velocity vectors, and then maps a velocity sequence to a location. To overcome the uncertainty in this task, the approach employs a Transformer-based neural architecture along with a Temporal Convolutional Network and an auto-regressive decoder. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a novel inertial localization problem, a new inertial localization benchmark, and an effective neural inertial localization algorithm. The code, models, and data will be shared by the authors.
