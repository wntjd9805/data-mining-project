This paper introduces the concept of fixing 3D object shapes based on functionality, highlighting the importance of considering functionality alongside aesthetics in shape design. The authors argue that functionality is a property associated with the physical interactions between the object and the user, rather than being solely determined by shape. They propose a new task of fixing malfunctional objects using a modular framework called FixNet. FixNet incorporates perception, physical dynamics, and functionality prediction to learn from a synthetic dataset called FIXIT, consisting of 5,000 point cloud videos of interactions with 3D objects. Experimental results show that FixNet outperforms baseline models, indicating its potential in real-world applications such as predicting interaction outcomes and recommending fixes for malfunctional objects.
