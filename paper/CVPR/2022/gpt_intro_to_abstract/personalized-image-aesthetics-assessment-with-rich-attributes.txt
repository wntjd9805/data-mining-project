This paper introduces the concept of image aesthetics assessment (IAA) and the two categories of assessment: generic image aesthetics assessment (GIAA) and personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA). While GIAA captures an "average opinion" of aesthetic preference, PIAA aims to capture unique individual preferences. Existing databases for PIAA, such as FLICKR-AES and AADB, have limited annotation diversity. To address this issue, the authors propose a new PIAA database called PARA, which includes both human-oriented and image-oriented annotations. The PARA database contains 31,220 images with annotations from 438 subjects, providing a comprehensive subjective study of personalized image aesthetics. The paper conducts an in-depth analysis of annotation information to understand the correlation between PIAA and psychological feelings. Additionally, the authors propose a benchmark study based on the PARA database, which demonstrates that modeling personalized aesthetic preference using subject information can improve PIAA model performance. Overall, this work contributes to the advancement of PIAA research by providing a richly annotated database and insights into personalized aesthetic preferences.
