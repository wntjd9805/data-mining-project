This paper addresses the problem of multiple rotation averaging in the presence of outliers. The objective is to find multiple absolute rotations given a partial set of noisy constraints on relative rotations. This problem has direct applications in structure-from-motion, multiple point cloud registration, and simultaneous localization and mapping. The initial orientations of cameras in global structure-from-motion pipelines are typically computed using rotation averaging. Therefore, the accuracy of subsequent operations depends on the solution produced by the rotation averaging algorithm. Previous research has aimed to develop reliable rotation averaging methods. However, solving large-scale rotation averaging problems is challenging, and the presence of outliers further complicates the task. Outliers can significantly degrade estimation accuracy if not handled properly. Commonly, rotation averaging is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem and solved iteratively. However, when the initial guess is affected by outliers, obtaining an accurate result becomes extremely difficult. Thus, robust initialization is crucial for reliable rotation averaging in the presence of outliers.In this work, the authors propose a novel method for robust multiple rotation averaging. The main contribution is a hierarchical initialization scheme that constructs a spanning tree of a rotation graph. This scheme prioritizes the propagation of the most reliable constraints first and the less reliable constraints later. Reliability is determined based on the number and consistency of triplet constraints, as well as the number of valid 2D-2D correspondences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the robustness of rotation averaging.The code and supplementary material for this work can be downloaded from the provided website.
