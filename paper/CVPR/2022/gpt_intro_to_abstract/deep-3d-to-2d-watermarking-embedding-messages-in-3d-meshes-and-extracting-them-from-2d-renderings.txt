Digital watermarking plays a crucial role in protecting copyright, source tracking, and authentication for digital content. This paper focuses on invisible watermarking, where the watermarked media should appear the same as the original. With the increasing use of 3D models in various applications, such as movie making, gaming, and 3D printing, watermarking for 3D models becomes important. Traditional methods for 3D watermarking are effective in manufacturing and printing industries but are not applicable to domains like gaming and movie making. Therefore, this work explores the problem of embedding and recovering messages invisibly in 3D meshes from 2D renderings. Inspired by recent advances in deep neural networks for image watermarking, the paper proposes a deep 3D-to-2D watermarking framework. This framework consists of an encoder, a distortion layer, a differentiable renderer, and a decoder. The differentiable renderer bridges the gap between 3D encoding and 2D decoding stages. The paper presents experiments and analyses to measure the capacity, robustness, and quality of the proposed method. The key contributions include presenting the first 3D-to-2D watermarking method, achieving end-to-end differentiability with differentiable rendering, and the ability to decode messages from non-differentiable renderers. Although the model has limitations in terms of bit capacities and compatibility with different rendering techniques, it demonstrates promising performance in various aspects.
