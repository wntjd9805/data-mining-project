Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in computer vision that aims to identify images of the same person from a large gallery set. Traditional ReID systems rely on training on a specific dataset, which limits their ability to adapt to new environments and incremental domains. To address this limitation, Class Incremental Learning (CIL) has been proposed, but it faces challenges when directly applied to ReID due to privacy concerns and the open-set retrieval setting. In this paper, we introduce Incremental ReID (IL-ReID) and propose the Augmented Geometric Distillation (AGD) framework to overcome these challenges. AGD consists of two components: Augmented Distillation (AD) and Geometric Distillation (GD). AD tackles the privacy issue by using a data-free incremental framework that leverages dreaming memory instead of real data for replaying. GD addresses the contradiction between stabilizing the feature space for preceding domains and adapting it for the incremental domain by maintaining the structure of the preceding feature space while allowing drift. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that AGD outperforms the baseline method with a margin of 6.0% mAP / 7.9% R@1, demonstrating its potential for generalized application in CIL.
