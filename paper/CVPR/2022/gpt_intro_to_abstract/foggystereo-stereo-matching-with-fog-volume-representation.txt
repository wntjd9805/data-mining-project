Stereo matching is a common task in computer vision that relies on discriminative features to achieve accurate results. However, in real-world scenarios, foggy or foggy-like scenes can significantly degrade the performance of existing methods. Previous approaches have treated fog as noise and discarded it to improve matching results. In this paper, we propose to leverage the fog and explore depth hints for stereo matching. Our approach is motivated by the observation that fog affects image quality differently based on depth. By reversing the atmospheric scattering process, we can extract depth hints from fog and use them to improve stereo matching. We introduce a fog volume representation that collects depth hints from the fog and fuse it with the cost volume to better handle foggy areas. Experimental results on synthetic and natural foggy scenes demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in foggy scenes while maintaining comparable performance in clear scenes. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our method in different depth ranges and fog thicknesses, highlighting its potential application in real-world scenarios.
