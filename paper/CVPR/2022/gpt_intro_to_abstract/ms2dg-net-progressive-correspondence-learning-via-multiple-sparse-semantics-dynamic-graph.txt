Recently, the task of finding high-quality correspondences in computer vision has gained significant attention due to its various applications. However, existing feature detection and description methods fail to provide distinctive local features, leading to ambiguous matching results. Consequently, the initial correspondence set often contains numerous incorrect correspondences. Outlier removal is crucial to improving the ratio of correct correspondences. Traditional methods such as RANSAC, VFC, and LPM are effective in specific scenes but struggle with the explosive growth of general datasets. To address this challenge, permutation-equivariant deep learning-based outlier removal methods have emerged. These methods capture the potential relationship among correspondences and have shown promising results. However, previous techniques do not consider the semantics information between sparse correspondences and fail to capture the local topology effectively. Inspired by the human matching process, this paper proposes a graph neural network approach called Multiple Sparse Semantics Dynamic Graph Network (MS2DG-Net). MS2DG-Net dynamically constructs graphs based on sparse semantics similarity to capture the local topology among correspondences. It adjusts the adjacency relationships between correspondence features and residual features in each graph, allowing for the fusion of multi-scale sparse semantics information. Experimental results demonstrate that MS2DG-Net effectively removes outliers while improving matching effectiveness. The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of sparse semantics similarity and the use of graph neural networks to dynamically construct graphs. MS2DG-Net enhances context modeling and preserves permutation-equivariance, resulting in richer contextual information and improved outlier removal in correspondence matching tasks.
