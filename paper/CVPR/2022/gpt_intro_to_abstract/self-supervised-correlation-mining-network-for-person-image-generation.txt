Pose guided person image generation is a challenging task in computer vision, as it requires non-rigid deformation to change the posture of a person image based on target poses. Existing approaches typically rely on aligned data pairs to supervise the training process, which poses limitations in terms of data collection and scalability. Unsupervised methods have been proposed as an alternative, but they often suffer from limitations in generation quality.In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Correlation Mining Network (SCM-Net) for person image generation. Our approach consists of three main phases: disentanglement, fusion, and translation. In the disentanglement phase, we use a Decomposed Style Encoder (DSE) to extract semantic-aware decoupled style features, allowing the source image itself to provide supervision for spatial feature deformation. In the fusion phase, we introduce a Correlation Mining Module (CMM) to exploit the spatial correlation between disentangled feature pairs, achieving alignment through spatial rearrangement. Finally, in the translation phase, a translation generator with skip connections is used to transform the rearranged style features into realistic person images.To address the lack of prior information on the lower body, we propose a Body Structure Retaining Loss (BSR Loss) that captures the semantic relationships among different body parts. This allows the model to make reasonable completions in the invisible regions during the transformation process. We employ a graph representation to model the semantic relationships, matching the graphs between input images and generated results to incorporate body semantic relationships into our model.Our proposed SCM-Net achieves person image deformation without the need for supervision from unaligned data pairs. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches and show competitive results in terms of generation quality. Additionally, our model demonstrates satisfactory results in face generation tasks, showcasing its migration capability.
