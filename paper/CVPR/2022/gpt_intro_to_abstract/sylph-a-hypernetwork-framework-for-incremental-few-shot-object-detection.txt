Advances in computer vision through deep learning have relied heavily on large-scale data collection and annotation, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Object detection, in particular, faces challenges in scaling data collection for the long tail of object categories. Few-shot learning of object detectors (FSD) has emerged as a solution to learn novel classes with limited samples. Existing FSD approaches primarily utilize fine-tuning or meta-learning strategies, but often fail to maintain performance on base classes or suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose an incremental few-shot detection (iFSD) model named Sylph, inspired by the nimble long-tailed hummingbird. Our approach leverages a base detector with class-agnostic localization capability and introduces key design differences from existing FSD approaches. We evaluate Sylph extensively and demonstrate its superiority over a baseline method across various datasets and evaluation regimes. On the LVIS few-shot learning benchmark, Sylph outperforms the main baseline by 8% points.
