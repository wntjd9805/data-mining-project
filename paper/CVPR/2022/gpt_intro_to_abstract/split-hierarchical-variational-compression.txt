The exponential growth of data, predominantly in the form of images and videos, has led to increased costs for data service providers in terms of transmission and storage. To address this issue, high-performance data compression codecs have been developed using likelihood-based generative models. These models learn a deep probabilistic representation of the data distribution and combine it with entropy coders to compress data. Three dominant modes for data compression have emerged: normalizing flows, variational autoencoders, and autoregressive models. Each approach offers a different trade-off between inference speed and compression performance. This paper focuses on data compression using variational autoencoders (VAEs) and aims to improve both coding ratios and time complexity. Two challenges are addressed: achieving competitive coding ratios without sacrificing time complexity, and developing an efficient means for single-image compression. The paper proposes two novelties for VAE-based compression: an autoregressive sub-pixel convolution for efficient interpolation between fully-factorized and per-pixel autoregressions, and autoregressive initial bits to eliminate the impracticalities of bits-back coding framework. These contributions are integrated into a codec called Split Hierarchical Variational Compression (SHVC), which outperforms existing VAE-based compression approaches in terms of compression performance and model complexity. The effectiveness of SHVC is demonstrated through experiments comparing it to other VAE approaches.
