Automated medical image segmentation is a challenging task in computer science with many clinical applications. Despite advances in deep learning methods, segmentation remains difficult due to the variability of target objects, limited data samples, and the high resolution nature of 3D images. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has emerged as a promising approach to finding well-performing architectures for automated image segmentation. While NAS has been applied to classification tasks, its application to segmentation is relatively new.Segmentation networks typically need to preserve features from multiple scales and aggregate them for accurate object segmentation. However, the search space for multi-scale, multi-path architectures can be extremely complex. Previous approaches, such as C2FNAS and DiNTS, have been proposed but suffer from limitations in scalability and feasibility.To address these limitations, we propose HyperSegNAS, a one-shot NAS approach specifically designed for 3D segmentation architectures. HyperSegNAS efficiently evaluates a large number of architectures under different computing constraints by using shared parameters. This eliminates the need to train each architecture from scratch. Additionally, HyperSegNAS evaluates discrete architectures, removing the optimization gap and infeasible configurations that arise in differentiable NAS. The proposed approach accurately fits the given constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge.The main contributions of this paper are as follows:1. Introduction of HyperSegNAS, a one-shot NAS approach for finding optimal 3D segmentation architectures.2. Proposal of a novel Meta-Assistant Network (MAN) structure to incorporate relevant meta information into NAS, addressing the challenges of the segmentation search space.3. Demonstration of improved results compared to previous methods such as DiNTS, and achieving state-of-the-art performances in multiple tasks in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge.In conclusion, this paper presents an innovative approach, HyperSegNAS, for automating the search and selection of optimal 3D segmentation architectures. The proposed method overcomes limitations of previous approaches, resulting in improved performance and efficiency in medical image segmentation.
