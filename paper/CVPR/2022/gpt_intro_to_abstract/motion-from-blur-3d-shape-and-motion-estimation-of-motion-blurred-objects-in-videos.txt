This paper presents a method called Motion-from-Blur (MfB) for estimating the 3D motion, shape, and texture of motion-blurred objects in videos. Unlike previous methods that focus on a single frame, our approach optimizes over multiple frames to achieve more accurate and complete results. By jointly estimating the 3D motion, shape, and texture across multiple frames, we can handle more complex object motions such as acceleration and abrupt direction changes. We also address the challenge of the exposure gap that occurs due to the camera shutter opening and closing in set time intervals. Our method successfully recovers the motion direction and produces more consistent and complete 3D shape reconstruction compared to single-frame approaches. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of our method in temporal super-resolution. The proposed method, Motion-from-Blur, is the first of its kind to optimize over a video sequence rather than a single frame. The source code is available for further exploration.
