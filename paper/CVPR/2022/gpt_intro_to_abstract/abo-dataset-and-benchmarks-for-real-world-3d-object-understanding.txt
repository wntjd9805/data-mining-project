This paper introduces the Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) dataset, which aims to address the lack of large-scale datasets containing realistic 3D objects from diverse categories and corresponding real-world multi-view images. Existing datasets either focus on synthetic 3D models with limited coverage and low quality, or on real images with reconstructed geometry but small sizes and controlled lab settings. ABO is derived from Amazon.com product listings and contains a large number of product listings, catalog images, and metadata attributes. It also includes turntable-style images and artist-designed 3D meshes. The 3D models in ABO have complex geometries, high-resolution, physically-based materials, and allow for photorealistic rendering. The dataset is released under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license and benchmarks the performance of various methods on three computer vision tasks: single-view shape reconstruction, material estimation, and image-based multi-view object retrieval. ABO aims to contribute to the development and evaluation of more realistic 3D computer vision systems.
