Fisheye lenses are commonly used to capture wide fields of view exceeding 180 degrees. However, traditional stereo matching algorithms based on the pinhole camera model are not suitable for fisheye images due to severe distortion at the outer edges of the images. To address this issue, projective image transformations such as equirectangular projection and latitude-longitude (LL) transformation have been employed to estimate depth information from fisheye images. However, these transformations increase computational cost and memory usage. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that subdivides spherical image information using a spherical geodesic grid. This subdivision enables equal-epiline subdivision and achieves higher stereo matching accuracy by regularizing cell sizes and in-between distances. By transforming sphere geometry into a 2D tessellated array, we directly apply epipolar geometry for fast spherical stereo matching from tessellated fisheye images. Our geodesic grid-based stereo matching method reduces required memory usage by 20% without sacrificing depth accuracy.Keywords: fisheye lenses, stereo matching, epipolar geometry, projective image transformation, spherical geodesic grid.
