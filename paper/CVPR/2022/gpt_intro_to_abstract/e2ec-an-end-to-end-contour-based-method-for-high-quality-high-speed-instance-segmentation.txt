Instance segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision with numerous applications in autonomous driving and robotic grasping. Traditional methods employ a two-stage pipeline, generating bounding boxes first and then performing pixel-wise segmentation within them. While accurate, these methods are inefficient for real-time applications. On the other hand, one-stage mask-based methods offer real-time performance but consume significant storage and suffer from lower-quality boundary prediction. Contour-based methods have gained attention due to their simplicity and ability to directly obtain instance boundaries without complex post-processing. However, current contour-based methods have shortcomings such as manually designed initial contours, limited information usage, and fixed vertex pairing. To address these issues, this paper proposes an end-to-end contour-based instance segmentation model called E2EC. It introduces a learnable contour initialization architecture, multi-direction alignment, and a dynamic matching loss function. E2EC achieves better performance than existing methods on various datasets while maintaining high efficiency.
