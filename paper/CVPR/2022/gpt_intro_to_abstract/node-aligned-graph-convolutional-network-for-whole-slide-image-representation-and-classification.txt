Histopathology plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and understanding the causes behind specific treatments. Whole-slide imaging (WSI) has emerged as a powerful technique for digital pathology, providing a comprehensive view of diseases and their effects on tissues. However, deep-learning-based approaches for WSI classification face unique challenges such as the ultra-high resolution of WSIs and limited availability of pixel- or region-level annotations. To address these challenges, current methods often adopt a two-stage multiple-instance learning (MIL) paradigm. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Node-Aligned Graph Convolution Network (NAGCN) for WSI representation and classification. The NAGCN leverages a hierarchical global-to-local clustering strategy, where a codebook is constructed using global clustering to filter out redundant information and select discriminative instances. Local clustering is then performed to select typical instances within sub-bags, and a node-aligned graph is built to represent WSIs. In contrast to existing graph-based methods, our NAGCN ensures node correspondence across different WSIs, enabling more options for generating slide-level representation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the NAGCN approach in accurately classifying WSIs with only slide-level annotations. Overall, our contributions include the introduction of a node-aligned GCN, leveraging global and local clustering for sub-bag generation, and the ability to retain both local structural information and global distribution in WSI representation and classification.
