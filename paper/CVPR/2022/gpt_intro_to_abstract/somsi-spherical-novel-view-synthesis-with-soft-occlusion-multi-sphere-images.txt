The introduction of low-cost 360◦ imaging devices has led to the widespread use of spherical images to represent 3D scenes. However, spherical images alone provide limited viewing experiences, as they only allow rotations around the center. Spherical novel view synthesis (SNVS) aims to estimate in-between views, enabling seamless user navigation in a scene. Current SNVS techniques based on Multi-Sphere Image (MSI) representation suffer from unsatisfactory quality in synthesized novel views. The use of Coordinate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (CMLP) in techniques like NeRF improves view synthesis quality, but rendering novel 360◦ views is slow. In this paper, we propose a novel SNVS technique that combines MSI representation with coordinate MLPs to achieve high-quality view synthesis with fast runtime. We introduce a new representation called Soft Occlusion MSI (SOMSI) that separates scene appearance and geometry to reduce memory consumption. We also present a fast rendering formulation for SOMSI. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous MSI-based techniques and achieves high-quality view synthesis on par with NeRF while being significantly faster. Our contributions include the SOMSI representation and efficient rendering method that combines the advantages of different techniques to achieve high-quality view synthesis with fast runtime.
