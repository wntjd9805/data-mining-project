Video object segmentation (VOS) is an important task in video understanding with applications in autonomous driving and video editing. This paper focuses on semi-supervised VOS, where the instances in video frames are segmented given annotations in the first frame. Matching based networks have been commonly used for this task, employing a memory bank mechanism to store embeddings of frames and assist segmentation. However, existing methods only utilize limited frames or suffer from an increasing memory size as video length increases. This paper addresses two main problems: 1) building an efficient memory bank to store historical information and 2) correcting inaccurately encoded embeddings caused by inaccurate masks. To solve the first problem, the paper proposes a recurrent dynamic embedding (RDE) with a spatio-temporal aggregation module (SAM) to organize and compress the historical cue and the embedding of the latest frame. Additionally, auxiliary supervision is used during training to control the distribution of RDE. For the second problem, a self-correction strategy is designed to repair embeddings of masks with different qualities in the memory bank using a mask consistency loss. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and synthetic long videos demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in achieving state-of-the-art performance in VOS. The contributions of this paper include introducing RDE for richer representation, improving memory bank efficiency with SAM, and addressing inaccurately predicted masks with a self-correction strategy.
