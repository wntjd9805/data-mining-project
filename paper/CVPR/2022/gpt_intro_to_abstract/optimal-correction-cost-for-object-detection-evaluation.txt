Evaluation measure is an important factor in algorithm development for object detection. While many benchmarks use mean average precision (mAP) as the primary metric, the consequences of optimizing mAP may not be fully understood. This paper introduces a new evaluation measure called Optimal Correction Cost (OC-cost) that evaluates detection accuracy at the image level. Unlike mAP, which ranks instances across a dataset, OC-cost evaluates detection results for individual images. The authors propose formulating OC-cost as an optimal transportation problem, aiming to minimize the cost of correcting detections to ground truths. This approach addresses issues with non-optimal assignments, IoU thresholding, and the focus on classification over localization quality in mAP. The paper presents experiments demonstrating the behavior of OC-cost and its usefulness in developing detectors. Overall, this alternative evaluation measure provides a more suitable approach for applications that require consistent performance across various images.
