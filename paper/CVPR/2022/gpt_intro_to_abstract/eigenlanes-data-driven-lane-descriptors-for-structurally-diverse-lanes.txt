Lane detection is crucial for autonomous vehicles and human drivers to navigate and follow traffic rules. However, lane detection faces challenges such as adverse weather conditions, occlusion by nearby vehicles, and a diverse range of lane structures. Traditional methods using hand-crafted features may fail to accurately detect lanes, leading to the development of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based techniques. These techniques often adopt the semantic segmentation framework but may struggle to detect less visible lanes in cluttered scenes.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for detecting structurally diverse road lanes in the eigenlane space. The algorithm introduces the concept of eigenlanes, which are data-driven lane descriptors obtained through low-rank approximation using singular value decomposition (SVD). Each lane is represented as a linear combination of eigenlanes, enabling reliable detection of straight and curved lanes in the anchor-based detection framework.The proposed algorithm consists of two modules: self-lane identification (SI) and inter-lane correlation (IC). The SI module computes the classification probability and regression offset for each lane candidate, while the IC module estimates the compatibility between pairs of lanes. The algorithm, called SIIC-Net, achieves competitive results on existing datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on a new dataset (SDLane) containing structurally diverse lanes.The contributions of this work include the introduction of eigenlanes as compact representations of structurally diverse lanes in the eigenlane space, the development of the SIIC-Net algorithm for effective and efficient lane detection, and the construction of the SDLane dataset, which better represents complex lane structures in real driving environments.
