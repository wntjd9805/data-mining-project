This paper addresses the problem of efficiently recovering the contents from blurry images caused by slight movement during photography. The degradation of a blurry image is modeled as a convolution of a latent sharp image with a spatial invariant kernel, representing the movement trajectory of the equipment. The goal is to accurately estimate the kernel and improve the final deblurred result. Current methods use blind deblurring to update the kernel and sharp image iteratively, but suffer from noisy kernels and local minima. To address these issues, the proposed method introduces a pixel screening strategy to identify and remove unnecessary structures in the intermediate image, leading to more accurate kernel estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets and challenging scenarios with large blur kernels and saturation, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
