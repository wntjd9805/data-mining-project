Image composition is a commonly used technique in image editing and data augmentation, but it often results in composite images that appear unrealistic due to the mismatch between foreground and background appearances. Image harmonization aims to adjust the appearance of the foreground to make it compatible with the background, but most existing methods do not consider this problem from the perspective of visual style, resulting in a lack of visual style consistency between the foreground and background. Some methods implicitly consider this problem through domain translation, but fail to directly transform the foreground feature in the generator. In this paper, we propose a solution to these issues by introducing a region-aware adaptive instance normalization (RAIN) for image harmonization. We argue that the lack of attention to local style distributions in areas of the background that are similar to the foreground leads to distortions in the harmonized image. Additionally, existing methods only use real images to guide training, which is insufficient to constrain the solution space effectively. Therefore, we propose incorporating multiple negative samples and jointly constraining the foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency to acquire more distortion knowledge and reduce the solution space. The proposed method addresses these limitations and improves the visual style consistency and realism of harmonized images.
