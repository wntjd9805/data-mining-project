Semantic patterns in image-based object classification are determined by the visual appearance and shape of object classes. Fine-grained object classification, which involves classifying objects with subtle shape differences within a category, presents a challenge in deep learning. This is because it requires distinguishing appearance details on specific parts, which often necessitates expensive part annotations.Previous approaches to fine-grained classification have focused on capturing fine-grained details in local regions by detecting discriminative parts and extracting local features, or by enhancing object representation's discrimination using bilinear pooling on feature vectors. However, few works have addressed the challenge of feature inconsistency caused by changes in object pose or viewing angle.In this paper, we propose an unsupervised part-to-pose network (P2P-Net) to address this challenge. P2P-Net captures both part details and object poses to regularize the representation learning without requiring additional annotations of part position or pose information. Inspired by Feature Pyramid Networks, our P2P-Net distinguishes confidently class-discriminative regions and incorporates fine-grained appearance details on specific parts via a contrastive loss.The P2P-Net differs from existing part-based methods by aligning parts in a self-supervised manner to discount pose variations and by offering feature regularization only during training, thereby eliminating the time-consuming part branch during testing. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of self-supervised part-based pose alignment as feature regularization, and we also propose curriculum supervision to improve discriminative details at different scales.In summary, our contributions include the proposal of an end-to-end P2P-Net that incorporates discriminative features on specific parts and promotes the discrimination of object representations through pose-insensitive feature regularization. We introduce an adaptive graph matching algorithm to achieve feature consistency against pose variations in an unsupervised learning manner. Additionally, we introduce a generic curriculum supervision on image classification using label-smoothing and shallow-to-deep sub-networks. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained image classification.
