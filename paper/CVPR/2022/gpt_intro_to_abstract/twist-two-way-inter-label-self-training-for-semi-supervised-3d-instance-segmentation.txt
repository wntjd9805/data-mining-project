Deep learning methods have achieved great success in 3D point cloud learning, but they require large-scale annotated data. Annotated data collection is a time-consuming and manual process, highlighting the need for semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods that can leverage unlabeled data. While SSL has been extensively studied in image understanding, less research has been done in the context of 3D instance segmentation. In this paper, we propose a new self-training framework called TWIST for semi-supervised 3D instance segmentation. TWIST generates high-quality pseudo labels from unlabeled data to improve model training. We address the challenges of semantic- and instance-level understanding, ensuring consistency among pseudo labels, and effective pseudo-label evaluation and selection. TWIST iteratively updates two sets of pseudo labels for semantic-level and instance-level supervision, utilizing a proposal re-correction module and bidirectional inter-label interactions to enhance label quality. Our experiments on the ScanNet v2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that TWIST outperforms supervised-only baselines and state-of-the-art unsupervised pre-training approaches. Furthermore, TWIST can be combined with existing 3D pre-training approaches for additional performance gains. Overall, our contributions include demonstrating the effectiveness of self-training for semi-supervised 3D instance segmentation, introducing the TWIST framework for generating accurate pseudo labels, and proposing a new state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning framework for 3D instance segmentation.
