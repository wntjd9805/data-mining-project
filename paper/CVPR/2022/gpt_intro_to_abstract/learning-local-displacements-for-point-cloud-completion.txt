Understanding the 3D space is crucial for humans and machines to navigate safely and interact with objects. However, capturing the 3D structure of an object or scene often results in missing geometry due to occlusion. To address this, geometric completion techniques have emerged. Various representations of 3D shapes, such as point clouds, volumetric grids, meshes, and implicit surfaces, are commonly used in computer vision tasks. Geometric completion methods typically focus on point cloud or volumetric data, with volumetric data being easier to process but limited by voxel resolution accuracy. Point clouds have the advantage of flexible local resolution but come with challenges such as undefined local neighborhoods and unorganized feature maps. Existing methods, such as PointNet and its variations, have made improvements in point cloud completion through k-nearest neighbor search and pooling operations. This paper explores the grouping of local features to enhance point cloud completion, applying encoder-decoder architectures with displacement vectors and introducing a new pooling mechanism called neighbor-pooling. A novel loss function is also proposed for gradual reconstruction from observable to occluded regions. The proposed approach is evaluated on object completion and semantic scene completion datasets, achieving significant improvements in high-resolution reconstruction with fine-grained details.
