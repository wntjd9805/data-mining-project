Human action recognition is a crucial problem in computer vision with various practical applications. Skeleton-based action recognition, which utilizes the skeleton structure of humans, has gained significant interest due to its robustness against cluttered backgrounds. This paper introduces a novel skeleton-based prediction framework for action recognition that advances the state-of-the-art in three key aspects.First, the paper proposes an algorithm for representation learning inspired by the information bottleneck theory. By deriving a novel information bottleneck objective and loss function, the model learns a latent representation that is maximally informative to the target variable while compressing the input information conditionally and marginally.The second advancement is the encoding method of the skeleton. The paper introduces a self-attention based graph convolution module, called SA-GC, to extract both extrinsic and intrinsic graph structures. The intrinsic topology captures contextual information from joint relations, improving human action recognition.Lastly, the paper presents a multi-modal skeleton representation by utilizing the relative positions of joints, which provides complementary spatial information. An ensemble of models trained with these representations significantly improves action recognition performance.The proposed approach, named InfoGCN, combines these three advancements to create a new learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that InfoGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy. The learned latent representation adheres to the proposed IB constraints, and the inferred context-dependent intrinsic topology adapts to the behavioral context.The contributions of this work include the introduction of information bottleneck objectives for efficient representation learning, the development of an SA-GC module for inferring intrinsic topology, the proposal of a multi-modal skeleton representation for ensemble modeling, and empirical verification through extensive experiments. InfoGCN demonstrates superior performance in skeleton-based action recognition.
