Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision for locating and categorizing objects within images. Traditionally, dense prior on grids has been used to cover potential objects in an image. However, this approach has limitations in terms of anchor designs, training sample selection, and post-processing operators. Recently, query-based object detectors have emerged as a new approach, using learnable embeddings to represent potential objects through attention-like operators. However, the adaptability of current query decoders to image content remains limited. Additionally, query-based detectors often introduce extra attentional encoders and explicit pyramid necks, increasing the complexity of detection pipelines. In this paper, we propose AdaMixer, a fast-converging and accurate query-based object detector with a simplified architecture. AdaMixer introduces an adaptive 3D feature sampler and adaptive mixing of channel semantics and spatial structures to effectively represent objects. Experimental results show that AdaMixer outperforms previous query-based detectors in terms of average precision on the MS COCO validation set. We hope AdaMixer will serve as a strong baseline for future research in query-based object detection.
