Incorporating deep neural networks for rotation regression has become increasingly important in computer vision, graphics, and robotics. However, obtaining large-scale real datasets with rotation annotations is laborious and expensive. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to training models with fewer labels by leveraging unlabeled data. While SSL has been widely explored in other areas such as classification and object detection, only a few works have addressed semi-supervised rotation regression, which presents unique challenges due to the continuous nature of rotation space and the non-Euclidean manifold structure of SO(3).In this paper, we propose a general framework called FisherMatch for semi-supervised rotation regression. Inspired by the success of the FixMatch approach in semi-supervised classification tasks, we aim to adapt it to rotation regression problems. The key idea is to filter out pseudo labels with low confidence and only supervise highly confident labels, improving the performance of semi-supervised learning. However, estimating prediction confidence for rotation regression is non-trivial, as traditional approaches such as classification probabilities or augmentation techniques are not applicable.To address this challenge, we propose a matrix Fisher-based rotation regressor that outputs the parameters of a matrix Fisher distribution. The entropy of this distribution is used as a confidence measure for pseudo label filtering. Only pseudo labels with high confidence pass the filtering and are used for model supervision. We demonstrate through experiments on benchmark datasets that the entropy-based confidence measure significantly improves rotation regression performance compared to supervised learning and other semi-supervised baselines.Overall, our work contributes to the field of semi-supervised rotation regression, providing a general framework and introducing a novel confidence estimation approach using matrix Fisher distributions. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and highlight its potential for various applications in computer vision, graphics, and robotics.
