This paper introduces a self-supervised deep learning method for image restoration that does not require external truth images during training. The proposed method is derived from the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator and utilizes a generative convolutional neural network (CNN) to approximate the posterior distribution. The key challenge is efficiently sampling from the posterior distribution, which is addressed by an adaptive stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (ASGLD) algorithm. The proposed method is applied to image restoration problems in compressed sensing (CS) and phase retrieval, and experimental results demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing dataset-free solutions. The contributions of this paper include an MC-sampling-based MMSE estimator with an untrained deep network, a new adaptive SGLD scheme for efficient sampling, improved performance in image restoration tasks, and potential applications to other ill-posed inverse problems in imaging.
