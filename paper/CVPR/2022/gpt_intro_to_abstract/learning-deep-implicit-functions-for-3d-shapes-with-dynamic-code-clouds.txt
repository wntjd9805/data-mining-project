Learning 3D shape representation is crucial in various applications of 3D computer vision. This paper introduces a novel approach called Dynamic Code Cloud Deep Implicit Function (DCC-DIF) for learning deep implicit functions of 3D shapes. Unlike previous methods that encode local codes in discrete and regular grids, DCC-DIF utilizes continuous and flexible code positions that can be dynamically optimized. The optimization is achieved through a Code Position (CP) loss, which guides the distribution of local codes around complex geometric details. By employing this approach, DCC-DIF represents 3D shapes more efficiently with a smaller number of local codes, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy and highly detailed geometry. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.
