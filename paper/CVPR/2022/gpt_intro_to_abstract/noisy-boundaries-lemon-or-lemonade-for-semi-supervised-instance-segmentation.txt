The performance of instance segmentation has greatly improved with the development of deep learning. However, current methods require expensive pixel-level labeled images for training. This restricts the scale of datasets and limits model performance. Semi-supervised instance segmentation, which aims to utilize unlabeled images, is a novel problem that has not been formally defined and addressed. Previous works have explored semi-supervised learning in object detection and semantic segmentation, but it has not been applied to instance segmentation. In this paper, we propose a framework for semi-supervised instance segmentation that leverages unlabeled images and explores the use of pseudo labels. We focus on noisy boundaries, which provide both useful and harmful information, and propose a noise-tolerant mask head and a boundary-preserving map to effectively learn from these boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various datasets, achieving comparable results with a smaller amount of labeled data than fully-supervised methods. We believe this framework will contribute to further research in this field.
