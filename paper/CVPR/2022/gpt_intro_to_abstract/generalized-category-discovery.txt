This paper addresses the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) in image recognition. GCD involves assigning category labels to unlabeled images in a dataset, potentially including new categories not observed in the labeled set. This problem is relevant in various machine vision applications such as product recognition, medical image analysis, and autonomous driving. Existing image recognition settings, including image classification, semi-supervised learning, open-set recognition, and novel-category discovery, have limitations in handling GCD due to assumptions about available labeled data and known categories. To tackle GCD, this paper establishes strong baselines by adapting methods from novel-category discovery and retraining them with a robust backbone architecture. It is shown that existing methods tend to overfit labeled classes in the generalized setting. To address this, a simple but effective method is proposed, which leverages the "nearest neighbor" classification property of vision transformers combined with contrastive learning. This approach utilizes contrastive training and a semi-supervised k-means clustering algorithm to recognize images without a parametric classifier, resulting in significant performance improvements over existing baselines on multiple object recognition datasets, including fine-grained benchmarks.Additionally, this paper proposes a solution to the challenging problem of estimating the number of categories in unlabeled data, which is often unknown in real-world scenarios. An algorithm is proposed that leverages the labeled set to tackle this problem.The contributions of this work include the formalization of the GCD setting, the establishment of strong baselines, a novel method using contrastive representation learning and clustering for GCD, a method for estimating the number of categories in unlabeled data, and rigorous evaluation on standard image recognition datasets and the Semantic Shift Benchmark suite.
