This paper introduces the problem of correspondence matching in computer vision and its applications in scene understanding, object dynamics modeling, and 3D reconstruction. The challenge lies in obtaining pixel-level manual annotations, which are expensive and impractical for some cases. While synthetic data can serve as an alternative in some tasks, it lacks generalization to real scenes. To address this, the paper explores the use of natural videos as a source of free supervision. Natural videos provide realistic appearance and shape variations, as well as valuable supervisory signals from the correlations among frames.Existing solutions for self-supervised temporal correspondence learning typically rely on reconstruction schemes or cycle-consistent tracking paradigms. However, these approaches neglect three crucial abilities for robust learning: instance discrimination, location awareness, and spatial compactness. To fill in these gaps, the paper presents a new framework called LIIR (Locality-Aware Inter- and Intra-Video Reconstruction). LIIR combines inter-video context with intra-video analysis to enhance instance-level separation. It incorporates position information into the representation to improve location sensitivity. Additionally, it incorporates a spatial compactness prior for sparse yet compact associations between pixels. Experimental results demonstrate that LIIR outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art methods and is comparable to or better than some fully-supervised methods in various correspondence-related tasks, such as video object segmentation, semantic part propagation, and pose tracking. Overall, LIIR provides a powerful framework for self-supervised correspondence learning.
