Table structure recognition (TSR) is an important task in computer science that aims to recognize the internal structure of tables and make the data machine-readable. This includes identifying both the logical structure, which focuses on the relationships between table elements, and the physical structure, which considers the coordinates of cell boxes. TSR is crucial for many downstream applications, but it remains challenging due to the complexity of table structures and the distortion caused by capture devices.Recent methods have attempted to address this problem by modeling table elements as graphs and using deep graph models like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to reason about their relationships. However, naively fusing different modalities of features can lead to discrepancies in relational inductive biases and an inability to handle diverse table structures. Alternative approaches that model intra-modality relationships separately and then fuse them through late-fusion strategies can suffer from a trade-off between intra-modality interactions and inter-modality collaborations.To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Neural Collaborative Graph Machines (NCGM) for heterogeneous table structure recognition (Hetero-TSR). Our method utilizes text segment bounding boxes as table elements and extracts multi-modal feature embeddings from appearance, geometry, and content dimensions. We introduce a collaborative block consisting of two modules, Ego Context Extractor (ECE) and Cross Context Synthesizer (CCS), to dynamically generate graph context and modulate inter-modality interactive information. By stacking these blocks hierarchically, we enable constant collaboration between intra-modality and inter-modality interactions throughout the network. This mimics the human perception process and leads to improved performance in TSR, particularly in challenging scenarios.Our contributions include:1. Investigating the importance of collaboration between different modalities in TSR and introducing the Hetero-TSR problem.2. Proposing NCGM, a novel approach tailored for Hetero-TSR, which alternates between intra-modality context extraction and inter-modality collaboration in a hierarchical manner.3. Demonstrating through extensive experimental results on public benchmarks that our method outperforms state-of-the-art TSR methods.4. Introducing a synthesizing method to augment existing benchmarks, enabling evaluation under more challenging scenarios and showcasing up to 11% improvement over the second-best method.In conclusion, our NCGM approach addresses the challenges of TSR by enabling collaboration between different modalities and achieving better performance, especially in challenging scenarios.
