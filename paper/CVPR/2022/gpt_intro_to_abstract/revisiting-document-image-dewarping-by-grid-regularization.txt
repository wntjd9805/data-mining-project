The introduction of the paper discusses the problem of document image dewarping in the context of document digitization. It highlights the limitations of current document scanning methods, particularly on handheld mobile devices, and the need for more efficient and accurate document image dewarping techniques. The paper provides a brief overview of the history of document image dewarping, from early surface reconstruction methods to the use of deep learning techniques. The authors then propose a novel approach that leverages geometric information of text lines and document boundaries to generate a deformation grid, improving the accuracy of character recognition. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness.
