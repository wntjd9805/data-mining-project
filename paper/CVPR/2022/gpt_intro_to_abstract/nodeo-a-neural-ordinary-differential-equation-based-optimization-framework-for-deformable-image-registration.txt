Deformable image registration (DIR) is a widely used process in computer science for establishing spatial correspondences between images. DIR involves finding a nonlinear and dense transformation that matches source and target images according to predefined similarity metrics. Traditional DIR approaches solve this as a pair-wise optimization problem, often with hard model assumptions that limit speed and accuracy. To address these limitations, recent research has applied deep learning techniques to DIR, but generalization to unseen data remains a challenge.In this paper, we explore the integration of flow-based approaches and deep learning in DIR. Flow-based approaches, such as Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM), use Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to generate diffeomorphisms that describe the image transformation. We propose a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) based optimization framework called NODEO that combines the benefits of both flow-based techniques and deep learning.NODEO treats the pixel/voxel locations in an image as a single evolving system and uses a deep neural network to parametrize the system's dynamics. By formulating the velocity field optimization as a neural network optimization, we aim to find a system trajectory that minimizes the dissimilarity between images. Our framework adds flexibility to the registration process by allowing the incorporation of dynamical constraints, spatial smoothness, and boundary conditions. It also enables the use of convolutional layers to capture spatial interactions within the system.The contributions of this paper are fourfold: (1) the generalization of the flow field approach to registration through high-dimensional dynamical system modeling, (2) the unification of the optimization problem of discovering differential equations and their solutions (velocity fields) in one network without requiring training data, (3) the enhanced flexibility and effectiveness of adding regularizations and constraints to solution transformations, and (4) the demonstration of the proposed framework as an alternative approach to optimization-based registration tools with state-of-the-art performance in various application domains.Overall, our framework provides a promising approach to deformable image registration that combines the advantages of flow-based techniques and deep learning, offering flexibility, efficiency, and improved performance.
