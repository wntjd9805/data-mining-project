Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a fundamental problem in computer vision that aims to infer the 3D structure of a scene from multiple images taken from different viewpoints. Recently, learning-based methods utilizing a cost volume pyramid have shown significant advancements in performance compared to other approaches. These methods typically perform a local depth search and estimate the depth for each pixel based on the expectation of approximated continuous depth distributions. However, these approaches tend to struggle with small objects and boundary regions with abrupt depth changes, where the assumption of a unimodal distribution does not hold.This paper addresses the limitations of existing multi-scale depth estimation frameworks by explicitly modeling the depth of each pixel at different resolutions using a multi-modal distribution. Instead of using a parametric distribution, a non-parametric distribution is utilized to learn the probability of each depth hypothesis along the 3D visual ray, providing more flexibility in the coarse-to-fine structure. The learning process is guided by the depth distribution within the corresponding depth patch at the highest resolution. The cost volume for the next level is built by branching the depth hypotheses using the top K probabilities.To overcome the loss of relative spatial relationship caused by pixel-wise depth branching processing, a sparse cost aggregation network is proposed to aggregate information in the new cost volume structure while preserving the spatial relationship. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance, particularly in boundary regions. On the DTU dataset, it outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach, Patchmatch-Net, by up to 32% on boundary regions.In summary, the contributions of this paper include: (1) the proposal of a non-parametric depth probability distribution modeling approach, (2) the construction of a cost volume pyramid by branching depth samples based on the modeled pixel-wise depth probability distribution, (3) the utilization of a sparse cost aggregation network to maintain rigid geometric spatial relations in the cost volume and avoid spatial ambiguity. These contributions result in an improved performance, especially in boundary areas, making the proposed approach the new state-of-the-art on the DTU dataset.
