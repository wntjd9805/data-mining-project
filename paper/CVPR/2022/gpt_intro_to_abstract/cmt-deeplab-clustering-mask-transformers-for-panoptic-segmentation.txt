Panoptic segmentation is a challenging segmentation task that aims to unify semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. Most existing panoptic segmentation frameworks decompose the problem into several proxy tasks. However, recent developments have shifted towards end-to-end systems, such as the DETR framework, which introduces the first end-to-end object detection method with transformers. In this framework, image features are enhanced by transformer encoders, and a set of object queries interact with the image features through transformer decoders to predict bounding box and mask embeddings.To simplify the panoptic segmentation procedure and avoid manually designed modules, an end-to-end panoptic segmentation framework called MaX-DeepLab has been proposed. However, the update and usage of object queries in the transformer-based method for segmentation tasks are performed differently, potentially causing issues such as sparse query updates and infrequent pixel-query communication. These issues are undesirable for segmentation tasks that require dense predictions.To address these issues, this paper draws inspiration from traditional clustering algorithms and proposes a novel approach called CMT-DeepLab. In CMT-DeepLab, the object queries are considered as cluster centers, and a cluster-update step is performed to update the centers by pooling pixel features based on clustering assignments. This approach generates denser attention maps and enables frequent communication between pixel features and cluster centers.In addition, the paper addresses the issue of location information not being well utilized in the cross-attention module. To resolve this, dynamic position encoding is adopted, and a reference mask is predicted for each cluster center. Location-sensitive clustering is achieved by adding location information to pixel features and cluster centers via coordinate convolution.The proposed CMT-DeepLab surpasses its baseline MaX-DeepLab and achieves superior performance on the COCO panoptic test-dev set. By reformulating and improving the end-to-end panoptic segmentation system from the traditional clustering perspective, CMT-DeepLab achieves a 4.4% higher PQ and reaches 55.7% PQ.
