The paper introduces the concept of 3D-aware image deformation in the field of photo editing. While previous techniques focused on altering scene information or modifying 2.5D information, 3D-aware deformation allows direct manipulation of the 3D geometry and appearance of an object. The paper addresses the limitations of existing methods and aims to enable 3D-aware deformation with minimal restrictions. The proposed approach utilizes the shape Laplacian, an intrinsic geometric property, to model handle-based image deformation. A neural network is introduced to predict the shape Laplacian from a 3D point cloud reconstructed from a 2D image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in producing accurate deformation weights and plausible deformations. The main contributions of the paper include proposing a method for 3D-aware deformation, introducing a novel network architecture for predicting the shape Laplacian, and demonstrating the superiority of the learning-based approach compared to alternative methods.
