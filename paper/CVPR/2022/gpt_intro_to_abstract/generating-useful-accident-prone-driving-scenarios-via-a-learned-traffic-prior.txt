The safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) relies on their ability to handle complex near-collision scenarios. However, these scenarios are rare in real-world driving, leading to a data scarcity problem that hampers the development and testing of data-driven models for perception, prediction, and planning. An effective solution is to generate these challenging scenarios in simulation, rather than relying solely on real-world data. This approach is particularly appealing for planning, as the appearance domain gap is not a concern. Previous work has explored methods to automatically generate challenging scenarios by controlling "adversarial" actors within a scene. However, these approaches often lack expressive priors over plausible traffic motion, limiting the realism and diversity of scenarios. Additionally, there has been less focus on determining if a scenario is unsolvable, i.e., even an oracle AV cannot avoid a collision. To address these limitations, we propose STRIVE (Stress-Test dRIVE), a method for automatically generating challenging scenarios to test a given AV system's planner. STRIVE perturbs an initial real-world scene through an optimization procedure to cause a collision between an arbitrary adversary and the planner. Our approach measures the plausibility of a scenario during optimization based on its likelihood under a learned generative model of traffic motion. This encourages the generation of challenging yet realistic scenarios. Unlike previous methods, STRIVE does not pre-select specific adversaries but jointly optimizes all scene agents, resulting in a diverse set of scenarios. Additionally, to accommodate non-differentiable planners, we use a differentiable proxy representation of the planner within the learned motion model, allowing gradient-based optimization.We propose a method to identify useful scenarios for improving a given planner by searching for solutions to generated scenarios to determine if they are degenerate and clustering solvable scenarios based on collision properties. We evaluate STRIVE on two AV planners, including a new rule-based planner, and demonstrate its ability to generate plausible and diverse collision scenarios. We also utilize the generated scenarios to improve the rule-based planner by identifying limitations in its design and tuning hyperparameters.In summary, our contributions include a method to automatically generate plausible challenging scenarios, a solution optimization approach to ensure scenario utility, and an analysis method to cluster scenarios based on collision type.
