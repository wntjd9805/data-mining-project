ImageNet has become a popular benchmark in computer vision, with many models and training techniques developed based on its performance. However, it has been recognized that vision models lack robustness against small input perturbations. Adversarial perturbations and natural noises can easily fool image classifiers. Data augmentation techniques have been used to increase robustness, but they mainly focus on improving robust accuracy for ImageNet classification.As ImageNet pretrained weights are commonly used for transfer learning in downstream tasks such as object detection and image segmentation, a fundamental question arises regarding the robustness of these models. Do models with pretrained weights that are robust to ImageNet benchmarks also show robustness in downstream tasks? This study investigates this question, particularly in the context of fixed-feature and full-network transfer learning.The findings reveal that robustified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) maintain robustness in object detection and semantic segmentation even when the whole network is fully fine-tuned. Interestingly, Swin Transformer, a variant of Vision Transformer specifically designed for dense prediction tasks, exhibits better robustness transfer than robustified CNNs in the fully fine-tuned setting. Additionally, it is challenging to transfer corruption robustness from ImageNet to CIFAR10, as a non-robust ImageNet pretrained ResNet performs the best when fine-tuned for CIFAR10.These findings call for a reevaluation of how the robustness of vision systems is evaluated, as existing data augmentation techniques may be overfitting to ImageNet benchmarks. Furthermore, the significant contribution of the Swin Transformer architecture to robustness transfer highlights the limitations of existing robustification methods.The focus of this paper is on common corruption robustness, specifically in the context of transfer learning from ImageNet classification to object detection and segmentation tasks. The study aims to shed light on the transferability of robustness and the evaluation of vision system robustness.
