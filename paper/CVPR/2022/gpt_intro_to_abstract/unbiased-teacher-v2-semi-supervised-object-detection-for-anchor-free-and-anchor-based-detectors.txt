Deep learning models have excelled in object detection tasks by training networks with abundantly labeled images. However, Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SS-OD) methods aim to reduce the need for labeled data by leveraging limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. Existing SS-OD approaches use self-training techniques to generate pseudo-labels and ensure consistency between augmented unlabeled data. Despite their success, there are two unresolved issues: the lack of prior SS-OD work on anchor-free detectors and the ineffectiveness of pseudo-labeling in bounding box regression. This paper addresses these issues by investigating the effectiveness of SS-OD methods on anchor-free detectors and proposing a new approach called Listen2Student to enhance the unsupervised regression loss. Listen2Student compares the prediction uncertainties between Teacher and Student models to select instances with lower Student uncertainties for enforcing the regression loss. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves significant improvements compared to existing SS-OD methods on both anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. The method effectively addresses the core issues in applying SS-OD methods to anchor-free detectors and demonstrates favorable improvements against state-of-the-art approaches. Ultimately, this method bridges the performance gap between anchor-free and anchor-based detectors in the semi-supervised setting.
