This paper aims to explore the spatial reasoning abilities of deep networks in the context of the SPARE3D dataset. While human visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, has been extensively studied, there is a lack of investigation into how deep networks perform in these tasks. Deep networks have proven their capability in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation by memorizing visual patterns, but struggle to reason spatially. The SPARE3D dataset offers challenging spatial reasoning tasks in line drawings, making it an ideal dataset for our study. Specifically, we focus on tasks such as view-consistency reasoning (T2I), isometric to pose reasoning (I2P), and pose to isometric reasoning (P2I). This paper provides an introduction to our research and the unique aspects of the SPARE3D dataset. Further details and task examples are included in the full paper.
