This paper introduces the concept of class-agnostic instance segmentation without the need for annotations. The proposed framework, called FreeSOLO, builds upon the SOLO instance segmentation framework and the self-supervised dense feature learning method DenseCL. FreeSOLO consists of two major components: Free Mask and Self-Supervised SOLO. Free Mask incorporates a "query-key" attention design to generate coarse object masks through self-supervised features. These masks are then ranked, filtered, and refined using non-maximum suppression and self-training strategies. Self-Supervised SOLO trains a SOLO model using the generated masks as pseudo-labels, while also considering weak supervision and label noise. FreeSOLO not only achieves unsupervised instance segmentation performance better than proposal generation methods using manual annotations but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised object detection/discovery. Additionally, FreeSOLO serves as a strong self-supervised pretext task for representation learning in instance segmentation. The proposed framework provides a simple and effective solution to the challenging problem of self-supervised instance segmentation.
