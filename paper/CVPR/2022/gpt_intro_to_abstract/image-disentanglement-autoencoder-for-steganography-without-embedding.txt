Steganography is a method of concealing secret messages within carrier media to ensure secure transmission. Traditional steganography techniques embed messages into carrier images, but recent advancements in deep learning-based steganography have allowed for increased payload capacity and improved imperceptibility. However, these methods still carry the risk of the hidden message being compromised through steganalysis tools. Steganography without embedding (SWE) is an emerging concept that allows for hiding messages without directly embedding them into a carrier, providing immunity to typical steganalysis attacks. There are two types of SWE techniques: mapping-based and synthesis-based. Mapping-based techniques have limited payload capacity, while synthesis-based techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), suffer from limitations in realism, diversity, and message extraction errors. This paper proposes a novel SWE algorithm called Image DisEntanglement Autoencoder for Steganography (IDEAS) to address the drawbacks of synthesis-based techniques. IDEAS utilizes an adversarial autoencoder that disentangles images into structure and texture representations, allowing for high-quality image synthesis and increased style diversity. The disentanglement approach improves security, secret message extraction accuracy, and adaptability for different extraction levels. The proposed algorithm achieves enhanced steganographic performance with improved security, reliable message extraction, and flexibility.
