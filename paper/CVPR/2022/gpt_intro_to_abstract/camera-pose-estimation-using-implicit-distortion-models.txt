The intrinsic calibration of a camera is essential for many computer vision tasks as it describes the mapping between 2D pixels in an image and corresponding rays in 3D space. Traditionally, this mapping is represented using a low-dimensional parametric model. However, in this paper, we propose an alternative approach that implicitly models the intrinsic calibration. Specifically, we focus on estimating the 6 degree-of-freedom camera pose when the intrinsic calibration is unknown but assuming a central and radially-symmetric camera.Our method replaces the explicit parametric model with a regularization term that enforces smoothness on the underlying distortion map. This implicit distortion model allows us to parameterize the intrinsic calibration in terms of the camera's extrinsic parameters, making it effectively parameter-free. It also generalizes well to various types of cameras and lens combinations, ranging from standard pinhole lenses to highly non-linear systems like fisheye or catadioptric cameras.Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to leverage multiple images from the same camera, and even integrated into a full bundle-adjustment framework for refining both 3D points and camera poses. Overall, our method offers a novel way to estimate camera pose without relying on explicit modeling of the intrinsic calibration, providing flexibility and applicability to a wide range of camera systems.
