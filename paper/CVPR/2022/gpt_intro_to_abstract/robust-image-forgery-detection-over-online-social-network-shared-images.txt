The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the increasing prevalence of image manipulation and its potential dangers in various fields, such as copyright infringement, fake news, and forged evidence. The paper highlights the dominance of online social networks (OSNs) as platforms for image transmission and the prevalence of forged images on these platforms. While many methods have been proposed to detect and localize image forgery, few have addressed the robust forgery detection against lossy operations in OSNs. The paper aims to address this issue by proposing a noise modeling scheme and integrating mimetic noises into a robust training framework. The noise is decoupled into predictable noise, which simulates known operations like JPEG compression, and unseen noise, which accounts for unknown actions by OSNs. The paper utilizes adversarial noise to model the unseen noise and demonstrates superior robustness in forgery detection compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the paper introduces a public forgeries dataset based on existing datasets and three OSN platforms. The rest of the paper reviews related work, presents the proposed robust training strategy, and provides experimental results.
