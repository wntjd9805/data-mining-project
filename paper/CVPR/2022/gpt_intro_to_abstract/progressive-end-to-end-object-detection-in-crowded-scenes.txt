The field of crowded object detection in computer vision has seen significant progress in recent decades, with many research efforts achieving impressive results. However, most existing methods rely on hand-crafted components, leading to sub-optimal performance in crowded scenes. A recent approach called DETR proposes a fully end-to-end object detection framework using learnable queries, achieving competitive performance without post-processing. In this paper, we investigate query-based object detection methods for crowded scenes and propose a progressive prediction method to improve their performance. Our method includes a prediction selector, relation information extractor, query updater, and label assignment, effectively addressing challenges such as multiple predictions for a single object and performance saturation. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods on challenging datasets like CrowdHuman, Citypersons, and COCO.
