This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently annotating large-scale LiDAR datasets for 3D semantic segmentation. The current annotation process is costly and time-consuming, hindering the scalability of this task. The authors propose a new annotation strategy using scribbles, which has proven effective in 2D semantic segmentation. They introduce the concept of line-scribble annotations for 3D point clouds, taking advantage of the metric space preserved in LiDAR data. To support this method, they provide a dataset called ScribbleKITTI, which contains 189 million labeled points across 19 classes. Moreover, the paper presents a novel learning method for 3D semantic segmentation that utilizes the scribble-annotated LiDAR data. Since no supervision is available from unlabeled points, which make up the majority of training data, special techniques are needed. The authors propose a teacher-student consistency loss, a self-training scheme, and a novel descriptor to improve pseudo-label quality. Combined with the mean teacher framework, their scribble-based pipeline achieves up to 95.7% relative performance compared to fully supervised training, while using only 8% labeled points. These contributions are independent of neural network architectures and can be integrated with any 3D LiDAR segmentation model. Overall, this work provides a more efficient and effective approach for annotating and training LiDAR data for 3D semantic segmentation.
