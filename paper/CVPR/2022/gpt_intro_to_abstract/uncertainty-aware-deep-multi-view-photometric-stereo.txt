This paper introduces an approach for dense 3D shape acquisition using multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS) that leverages deep neural networks. While multi-view stereo (MVS) is effective for textured surfaces, it struggles with non-textured objects and high-frequency surface details. Photometric stereo (PS) excels at recovering high-frequency details but suffers from low-frequency distortion. The proposed approach combines the complementary responses of MVS and PS to overcome these limitations. Deep-MVS and deep-PS networks are used to infer per-pixel depth and surface normals, respectively. Uncertainty estimation is incorporated to select and combine reliable surface estimates. To recover lost geometric details, an MLP-based optimization is introduced to approximate a plausible surface using point cloud and surface normals. The contributions of this work include an effective deep neural network-based solution for MVPS, uncertainty-aware modeling, and an implicit neural shape representation for surface recovery. The proposed approach achieves dense, detailed, and precise 3D shape reconstruction while improving robustness and reducing memory footprint.
