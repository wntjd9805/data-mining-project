In recent years, there has been a growing interest in 3D part segmentation tasks in computer vision, graphics, and robotics. These tasks involve parsing objects into their constituent parts to support various applications. While current methods achieve impressive results on shapes from the same distribution as the training set, they struggle when parsing shapes from novel distributions.In this paper, we focus on generalizable 3D part segmentation and aim to improve the ability of networks to parse shapes from novel distributions. One major challenge is the diverse cues that define parts, such as geometric primitive fitting, rigid motions, and semantic priors. Different cues can result in different part segmentations for the same shape. Therefore, a network needs to not only understand input shapes but also identify the cues defining parts from the training data.Existing works typically focus on specific types of parts and incorporate part-type priors to achieve generalizability. However, these approaches often require a deep understanding of the target task, which may not always be available. Another line of works from the machine learning community focuses on generic domain generalization algorithms but neglects geometric priors important for part segmentation tasks.To address these limitations, we propose AutoGPart, a generalizable 3D part segmentation technique applicable to any type of 3D parts. Our approach leverages proper intermediate supervisions that are more closely related to the real part cues and less influenced by shortcut features. We design a parametric model to encode the distribution of these supervisions, incorporating geometric priors. We also introduce an automatic search algorithm to discover suitable intermediate supervisions for a specific part segmentation task.Experimental results on three generalizable 3D part segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We achieve significant improvements in mean IoU and mean recall compared to existing methods. In summary, our contributions are threefold: 1) the introduction of a generic method to improve the generalizability of 3D part segmentation networks through automatically discovered intermediate supervisions; 2) the design of a parametric model to depict the distribution of useful intermediate supervisions with geometric priors; and 3) an automatic search algorithm to find the appropriate intermediate supervision for a given part segmentation task.
