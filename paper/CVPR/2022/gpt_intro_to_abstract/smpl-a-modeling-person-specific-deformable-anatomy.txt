Advancements in medical procedures require accurate information on the location and shape of target tissues. The limited number of invasive radioactive scans that a patient can undergo within a specific time period poses challenges for doctors in planning imaging protocols. Balancing patient risks and spatial-temporal inconsistencies, alternative solutions are needed to determine disease progression or treatment impact without excessive imaging. Current protocols rely on patient-specific molds to maintain consistent organ positioning during scanning and treatment. However, these methods are suboptimal, time-consuming, and costly. This study proposes organ pose estimation as a solution to reduce the need for patient-specific molds, improving cost and efficiency in vital procedures. Additionally, cheaper and computationally-lighter organ pose estimation methods can have broader applications in various domains. Existing simulation tools that predict soft tissue deformation, such as finite-element modeling (FEM), are not suitable for real-time and artistic applications. This paper introduces a lightweight modeling function that is conditioned on the target person's pose, making real-time and artistic simulations accessible to a wider audience. The study also presents a novel approach to modeling in vivo organ deformations using the skinned multi-person linear (SMPL) model. By capturing the relationship between pose parameters and internal organ deformations, the proposed framework allows for patient-specific organ representation extraction from previous medical scans and estimation of organ deformations for future scans. The contributions of this research include unifying organ shape representations across different patients, proposing SMPL-A for pose/shape-dependent organ deformation estimation, and demonstrating the encoding of shape and elastic properties into lower-dimensional representations. Experimental results show that patient-specific organ meshes can be reconstructed based on pose changes, using the extracted organ representation from previous scans.
