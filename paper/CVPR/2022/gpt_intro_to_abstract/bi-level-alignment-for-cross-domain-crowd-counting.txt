Crowd counting is a crucial task in computer vision with various applications such as video surveillance, traffic control, and human behavior analysis. However, obtaining accurate crowd counts can be challenging, especially in crowded scenes. Traditional crowd counting methods rely on dense annotations of human heads, which can be expensive and prone to noise. To address this, a synthetic dataset called GTA5 Crowd Counting (GCC) with automatic annotations has been created. However, models trained on synthetic data perform poorly on real-world images due to the domain gap between the two. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been proposed to bridge this domain gap without requiring annotations on the real domain. These methods include SE Cycle-GAN, Gaussian Process-based iterative learning (GP), and adversarial frameworks. However, these existing methods have limitations such as reliance on external labeled datasets for pre-training or less efficient inference. In this paper, we propose a new adversarial learning-based method for synthetic-to-real adaptive crowd counting. Our method incorporates task-driven data alignment and fine-grained feature alignment to improve performance. Unlike previous methods, we consider both target style priors and the task objective for domain augmentation. Additionally, we handle foreground and background regions separately to address their semantic differences. The contributions of our work are threefold: 1. We propose a novel adversarial learning-based method for effective and efficient synthetic to real adaptive crowd counting.2. Our approach is the first UDA method to search for the optimal source data transform based on the downstream task performance on the target domain.3. Experimental results on various real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results for synthetic-to-real domain adaptation, while remaining simple and efficient to apply.
