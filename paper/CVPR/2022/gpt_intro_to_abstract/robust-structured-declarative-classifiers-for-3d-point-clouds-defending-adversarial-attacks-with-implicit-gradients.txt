This paper introduces a novel approach for robust point cloud classification using a family of structured declarative classifiers. Point clouds are widely used in applications such as autonomous driving, and deep neural networks have been used to recognize them. However, recent works have shown that these networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To defend against these attacks, several adversarial defenders have been proposed. One common strategy is to denoise the attacked point clouds before feeding them into the classifiers. This paper explores the use of implicit gradients in designing robust defenses for 3D point clouds. Implicit gradients are defined by a differentiable function that takes the input and output of a defender as its input. The paper also proposes a bilevel optimization framework to learn the network parameters in an end-to-end fashion. An effective and efficient instantiation of the proposed classifiers, called the Lattice Point Classifier (LPC), is also presented. The LPC uses structured sparse coding in the permutohedral lattice and 2D convolutional neural networks for classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art adversarial defenders and attackers. Overall, this work contributes to the field of robust point cloud classification by introducing a new approach based on structured declarative classifiers and implicit gradients.
