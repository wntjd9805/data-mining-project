Psychological studies have shown that the recognition process in visual perception involves hierarchical structural descriptions by breaking shapes into components and organizing them based on spatial relationships. This concept has influenced the development of computer vision algorithms that reconstruct images using capsule templates, decomposing objects into subparts instead of holistic representations. These subparts are treated as visual words and aggregated into higher-level part capsules, creating a natural subpart-to-part hierarchy. Constraints are integrated into the algorithm to maintain shape and appearance consistency, resulting in more semantically meaningful parts. Additionally, the covered regions of the part capsules can be used as segmentation maps for unsupervised face segmentation tasks. Compared to other segmentation methods, the proposed Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule) demonstrates better semantic consistency, providing more interpretable descriptions of discovered parts. The contributions of this work include the introduction of HP-Capsule, which allows for the understanding of homologous structures within neural networks, the proposal of the Visibility Activation Function (VAF) to ensure localized subpart decomposition, and the development of the Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) for subpart aggregation and the creation of the face hierarchy. Experimental results on BP4D and Multi-PIE datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
