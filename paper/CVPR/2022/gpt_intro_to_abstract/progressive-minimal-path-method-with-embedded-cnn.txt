Topology-aware centerline segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, particularly when analyzing roads and rivers in satellite images. The complex shape and varying environment of these structures present challenges for common object segmentation methods. Typically, a binary mask of the tubular structure is computed, followed by heuristic-based post-processing to determine the centerline and handle gaps. Minimal path methods based on Dijkstra's algorithms or the fast marching method offer a more elegant solution. These methods assume the start and end points of the centerline are given and focus on determining the path itself. However, they often rely on hand-tuned image features, which can lead to shortcuts in challenging environments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can automatically extract stronger image features but require large amounts of annotated training data. Limited annotations hinder the full training of CNNs, resulting in shortcuts as well.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Path-CNN, which combines CNNs with the progressive minimal path method. By alternately employing these two techniques, they mutually benefit each other. CNNs enhance the detection of shortcuts, enabling better determination of minimal paths. Unlike previous approaches that learn features for isolated pixels, our CNNs learn features for rectified patches along paths. On the other hand, the progressive minimal path method ensures line-topology and provides strong geometric priors. These priors reduce the number of training samples for CNNs significantly. While our method only utilizes centerlines as training data, it not only determines centerlines but also produces binary segmentation masks for tubular structures. This is the first approach to employ geometric priors for CNNs in segmenting centerlines of tubular structures. Compared to deep learning-based approaches, our method has lower requirements for annotations and hardware.
