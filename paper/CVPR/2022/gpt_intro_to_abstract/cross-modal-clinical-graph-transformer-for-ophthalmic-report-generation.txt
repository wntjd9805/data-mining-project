This paper introduces the concept of automatic ophthalmic report generation using artificial intelligent (AI) models. The authors highlight the time-consuming and error-prone nature of manual report writing, especially for inexperienced ophthalmologists. They propose a Cross-modal clinical Graph Transformer (CGT) for ophthalmic report generation (ORG) to address this issue. The CGT utilizes an information extraction scheme based on a natural language processing pipeline to obtain a clinical knowledge graph. The authors also discuss the challenges of incorporating medical knowledge into image captioning models and present their solution of using a homogeneous embedding space and a cross-modal encoder. Experiments conducted on the FFA-IR benchmark dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the CGT model in generating accurate reports, as well as providing a solid rationale for the generated explanations. Overall, this research offers a promising approach to automate and improve the efficiency of ophthalmic report generation in clinical practice.
