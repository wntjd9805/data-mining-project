This paper introduces a novel and general architecture and representation for modeling dynamic 3D surfaces. Existing methods for dynamic representations either rely on parametric models for specific categories or apply a universal 4D representation with an ad hoc chosen canonical shape. In contrast, our approach factorizes the deformation between frames using continuous invertible functions, allowing for the recovery of consistent correspondence across frames. We model the reference surface using an implicit field in a Canonical Deformation Coordinate Space (CaDeX) and optimize it alongside the canonical maps during training. Our main contributions include the proposed representation and architecture, learnable continuous bijective canonical maps, a solution for dynamic surface reconstruction and correspondence tasks, and state-of-the-art performance on various deformable categories.
