Visual object tracking (VOT) is a long-standing topic in computer vision that aims to recognize targets undergoing large appearance variations while filtering out distractors in the background. Appearance-based approaches in VOT focus on learning expressive feature embedding spaces and developing robust correlation operations. However, these approaches often overlook the target-distractor dilemma faced by the feature network during the correlation step. The underlying reasons for this dilemma include the unawareness of the Siamese encoding process, a lack of explicit modeling for the backbone to learn the decision boundary, and the limitation of training videos that only annotate single objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel Single Branch Transformer (SBT) network that leverages the attention scheme. The SBT network dynamically generates "appropriate" embeddings that exhibit both coherent characteristics for the same object and contrasting features for targets and distractors with similar appearances. By allowing features from the template and search images to deeply interact with each other, the SBT network achieves a win-win scenario by differentiating the target from distractors while preserving coherence among dissimilar targets. The effectiveness of the SBT features is validated through experiments, which show improved performance compared to Siamese, DCF, and Transformer-based trackers.The SBT framework consists of Extract-or-Correlation (EoC) blocks with two variants: EoC-SA and EoC-CA, which use Self-Attention (SA) and Cross-Attention (CA) as core operators, respectively. These blocks fuse features within the same image and mix features across images, enabling the deep fusion of search and template image features for tracking. The SBT network can be pre-trained on unpaired images such as ImageNet, leading to faster convergence in the fine-tuning phase of tracking.Extensive experiments are conducted to compare different SBT network designs, demonstrating outstanding performance and improvements over existing trackers. The contributions of this work include the introduction of a specialized target-dependent feature network for VOT, the systematic study of SBT tracking both experimentally and theoretically, and the summarization of general principles for future work in the field.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 presents the SBT framework, Sections 4 and 5 discuss empirical studies and theoretical analysis on SBT, respectively. Section 6 provides extensive experimental results, and the paper concludes in Section 7.
