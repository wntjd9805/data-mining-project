Capturing high-quality images in low-light and nighttime environments is a challenge due to the low photon count and subsequent amplification of sensor noise. This is particularly problematic for smartphone cameras with limited light absorption per pixel photosite. Traditional solutions, such as long exposure, are not always practical. Recent advancements in deep neural networks have shown promise in rendering noisy nighttime images to aesthetically appealing outputs. However, obtaining high-quality ground-truth images for training these networks is burdensome, requiring careful capture and alignment. Additionally, the need for sensor-specific data collection poses further challenges. Some approaches have attempted to synthesize nighttime data using DNNs, but they often produce artifacts and unrealistic content. This paper proposes a method that utilizes daytime images to generate pairs of high-quality and low-quality nighttime images without the need for large datasets. This approach minimizes loss in image details and structure and does not require specific setup or capture conditions. The proposed framework trains neural image signal processors (ISPs) to enhance noisy nighttime images, achieving performance comparable to exclusively training on real nighttime images but with significantly reduced time and effort.
