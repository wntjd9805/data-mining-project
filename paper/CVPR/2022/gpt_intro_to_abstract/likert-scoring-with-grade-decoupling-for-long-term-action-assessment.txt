In this paper, we address the task of action quality assessment (AQA) and propose a novel scoring paradigm called Likert scoring. AQA is the evaluation of how well a specific action is performed, and it has various real-world applications. We focus on the challenge of assessing long-term actions, which contain different levels of skill at different parts. We introduce the concept of performance grades and propose that the quality score should be determined by the comprehensive effect of these grades. We propose Likert scoring, inspired by the Likert scale, which quantitatively evaluates respondents' mental states. In the context of AQA, we treat assessing a complex action as filling a "scale" with performance grades as the statements. We propose a Grade-decoupling Likert Transformer (GDLT) model that uses a Transformer architecture to extract grade-specific features from the input video and perform Likert scoring. Our main contributions are the introduction of Likert scoring as an assessment paradigm and the use of Transformer architecture for grade decoupling in AQA. We evaluate our model on two public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results, demonstrating its effectiveness.
