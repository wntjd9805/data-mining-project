In this paper, we address the issue of few-shot font generation by considering the factors that determine people's judgment on font styles and how people learn to write new characters correctly. We argue that the components of a character, such as endpoint shapes and stroke thickness, play a significant role in determining font style. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel component-guided generative network called CG-GAN for few-shot font generation.Existing methods for few-shot font generation have limitations and require large amounts of paired data for supervision. Our proposed CG-GAN overcomes these limitations by utilizing a Component-Aware Module (CAM) that supervises the generator at the component level. CAM employs an attention mechanism for component extraction and uses the learned attention maps for component-level style classification and realism discrimination. This allows the generator to focus on style consistency, structural correctness, and image authenticity at the component level, resulting in significantly improved quality of generated glyph images.One major advantage of our method is that it does not require paired training data. Once the model is trained, our generator can generalize to unseen styles, contents, and even other language glyphs, enabling cross-lingual font generation. Compared to existing component-based methods, CG-GAN achieves performance improvement by providing more effective supervision without increasing the complexity of the generator. It also captures local style patterns without explicit dependency on predefined component categories, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in one-shot Chinese font generation and cross-lingual font generation.Extensive experiments show that CG-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in one-shot font generation. Furthermore, by coupling the component-level guidance with a novel framework design, CG-GAN can be extended to handwriting generation and scene text editing tasks, producing impressive results. Our proposed method shows significant potential in enhancing the representational ability of the generator and preserving detailed glyph structures.Keywords: few-shot font generation, generative network, component-level supervision, attention mechanism, style classification, structural correctness, image authenticity, cross-lingual font generation, handwriting generation, scene text editing.
