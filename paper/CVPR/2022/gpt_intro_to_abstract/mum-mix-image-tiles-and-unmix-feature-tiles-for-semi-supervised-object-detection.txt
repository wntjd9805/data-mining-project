This paper introduces the challenge of acquiring enough labeled data for object detection tasks, which require both class labels and location information for multiple objects per image. To address this challenge, the paper explores semi-supervised learning (SSL) and semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), which leverage unlabeled data during training. The paper focuses on the teacher-student framework of SSL, where a teacher network generates supervisory signals for training the student network. Data augmentation plays a significant role in this framework, with strong augmentations applied to the student and weak augmentations given to the teacher. The paper proposes the Mix/UnMix (MUM) method, which efficiently applies interpolation-regularization (IR) as a data augmentation technique for object detection. MUM generates mixed images by mixing image tiles in a batch, allowing the feature maps to maintain their positions in the original images through an unmixing process. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MUM compared to the baseline method. Additionally, the paper explores the versatility of MUM with different architectures and demonstrates its compatibility with the SSOD problem through thorough analysis of feature maps and class activation maps. Overall, the proposed MUM method offers a simple and effective data augmentation approach for SSL in object detection tasks.
