A large high-quality labeled dataset for person re-identification (Re-ID) is labor-intensive and expensive to create. Existing fully labeled datasets for person Re-ID are limited in scale and diversity compared to other vision tasks. Model pre-training becomes crucial to achieve good Re-ID performance. However, most previous methods use models pre-trained on the crowd-labeled ImageNet dataset, resulting in limited improvement due to the domain gap between generic images and person-focused images. To tackle this issue, unsupervised pre-training on a web-scale unlabeled Re-ID image dataset called "LUPerson" has been shown to surpass pre-training on ImageNet. In this paper, we propose noisy label guided person Re-ID pre-training, leveraging the spatial and temporal correlations in videos as weak supervision. This can be achieved by utilizing the tracklets of a person over time derived from any multi-object tracking algorithm. We create a new variant of LUPerson named "LUPerson-NL" for pre-training with noisy labels, consisting of 10M person images from 21K scenes with noisy labels of about 430K identities.We introduce a new pre-training framework called PNL (Pre-training framework utilizing Noisy Labels) composed of three learning modules: (1) a simple supervised learning module, (2) a prototype-based contrastive learning module, and (3) a label-guided contrastive learning module. The PNL model achieves significant improvements on various person Re-ID benchmarks, outperforming both ImageNet supervised pre-training and unsupervised pre-training baselines. Notably, our pre-trained models show even larger gains in small-scale and few-shot settings where labeled Re-ID data are extremely limited.Our contributions include proposing noisy label guided pre-training for person Re-ID, constructing the largest noisy labeled person Re-ID dataset "LUPerson-NL" without human labeling effort, and pushing the state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks without additional enhancements.
