Hand analysis has significant applications in Computer Vision, including human understanding, action recognition, gesture recognition, and sign language recognition. It is also crucial for Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality applications. While previous research has focused on problems such as hand detection, hand pose estimation, hand tracking, and hand contact estimation, there has been little effort in studying hand-body association.In this paper, we address the problem of detecting hands in images and associating them with the corresponding person. This task is useful for action recognition, scene understanding, and assessing motor and social skills in children with mental disorders. However, detecting hands and associating them with bodies in unconstrained conditions is challenging due to overlapping and occlusions between hands and bodies.Existing approaches often detect hands and people separately and establish correspondences based on heuristics. However, these methods perform poorly due to the extreme articulation of hands and bodies. Another approach is to use a human pose detector, but this method is unreliable in scenes with multiple people or partial occlusions.To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel convolutional architecture that jointly detects hands and bodies and associates them. We extend the state-of-the-art object detector MaskRCNN by adding a Hand-Body Association Network module. This module consists of two novel modules: the Overlap Estimation Module and the Positional Density Module. The Overlap Estimation Module uses visual features to estimate if hands and bodies can overlap, while the Positional Density Module estimates the density of possible body locations for each hand.We also contribute a large-scale dataset of unconstrained images with annotations for hand and body locations. This dataset contains challenging scenarios with multiple people and varying degrees of occlusions and overlaps.Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of hand-body association in two downstream tasks: hand tracking and hand contact estimation. Our experiments show that reasoning about the hand-body association improves the performance of these tasks.Overall, our proposed approach and dataset contribute to advancing hand analysis in Computer Vision and have practical applications in various domains.
