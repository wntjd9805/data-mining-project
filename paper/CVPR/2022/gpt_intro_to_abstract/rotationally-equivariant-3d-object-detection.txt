3D object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. While existing 3D object detectors have shown effectiveness in both indoor and outdoor scenes, they fail to explicitly consider object rotation equivariance in their designs. Object rotation equivariance refers to the invariance of shape and equivariance of orientation in 3D detection. In other words, the detection result for an object should maintain the same shape and orientation, regardless of its orientation in the input scene. However, non-equivariant detectors often suffer from changes in box shape and unaligned variations in box orientation. To address this issue, previous research has explored the use of equivariant networks (EN) to exploit rotation equivariance. However, EN mostly focuses on rotation equivariance regarding the full visual input, which is not ideal for object detection as individual object orientation can be independent of the scene.In this paper, we propose a novel Equivariant Object detection Network (EON) to leverage object-level equivariance for 3D detection. Our approach is based on the concept of rotation equivariance suspension, which allows our model to extract equivariant features up to an intermediate stage. By doing so, we provide local spatial support to rotation equivariance and allow the model to adaptively adjust its effective spatial support. Additionally, we decompose each equivariant feature into an object orientation hypothesis and an invariant object-frame feature to enable the aggregation of context information without breaking object-level equivariance. Our modular design enables easy integration with state-of-the-art 3D object detectors.We evaluated our method on various benchmarks for indoor and outdoor 3D object detection and observed significant performance improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art detectors. Our contributions include being the first work to explore rotation equivariance for 3D object detection, proposing the EON model with rotation equivariance suspension, and demonstrating the benefits of object-level equivariance in boosting detection performance.
