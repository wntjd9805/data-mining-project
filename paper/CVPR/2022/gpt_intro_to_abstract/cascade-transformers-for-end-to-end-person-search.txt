Person search is a challenging problem in computer vision, where the goal is to locate a specific person in a set of scene images. This problem requires both generalization to distinguish people from the background and specialization to discriminate between different individuals. In real-world applications, person search systems must be able to detect people in images of various sizes and re-identify them despite changes in resolution and viewpoint. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of modern person search methods, including two-step and end-to-end approaches. Two-step methods involve separate person detection and re-identification steps, while end-to-end methods jointly solve these sub-problems. However, both types of methods still face three primary challenges: 1) the conflict in feature learning between person detection and re-identification, 2) the difficulty in handling significant scale or pose variations, and 3) the ambiguity introduced by occlusions with background objects or other people. To address these challenges, the authors propose a novel approach that combines feature pyramids or deformable convolutions with advanced feature fusion strategies. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing person search approaches.
