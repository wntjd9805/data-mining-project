This paper focuses on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), a technique that uses weak supervision such as image-level labels or bounding boxes to train segmentation networks. The common approach for generating pseudo-masks in WSSS is class activation mapping (CAM), which applies a global threshold to the activation map. However, existing methods using CAM suffer from limited object coverage and suboptimal threshold choices. This paper argues that the performance bottleneck of WSSS lies in the global threshold applied after CAM, rather than the object coverage. The authors propose a new approach called the Activation Manipulation Network (AMN) to address this problem. AMN uses per-pixel classification with label conditioning to manipulate the activation maps, reducing the activation imbalance within the foreground and maintaining a large activation gap between the foreground and background. Experimental results show that AMN significantly improves the quality of pseudo-masks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
