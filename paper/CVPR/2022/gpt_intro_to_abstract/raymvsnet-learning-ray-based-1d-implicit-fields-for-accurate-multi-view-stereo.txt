Learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) has become increasingly popular in recent years. The core idea of MVSNet and its successors is to construct a 3D cost volume by warping image features from multiple source views onto fronto-parallel sweeping planes at hypothesized depths. 3D convolutions are then used to extract 3D geometric features and regress the final depth map of the reference view. However, most existing methods are limited to low-resolution cost volumes due to the computational and memory requirements of 3D CNN. Some recent works have proposed to upsample or refine the cost volume to increase the resolution of the output depth maps, but this still presents a trade-off between depth and spatial resolutions. In this paper, we propose a new approach called RayMVSNet that directly optimizes the depth values along each camera ray. This allows us to convert the MVS problem into ray-based depth optimization, which is a more lightweight task compared to full cost volume optimization. We introduce the concept of learning a 1D implicit field along each ray, where the zero-crossing point of the field indicates the scene depth along that ray. To achieve this, we propose two critical designs: an Epipolar Transformer to learn the matching correlation of pixel-wise features between views, and a fixed-length range constraint to make the output field monotonous. We also propose a multi-task learning approach based on LSTM for sequential modeling and prediction of the 1D implicit fields. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets, with overall reconstruction scores of 0.33mm and f-scores of 59.48%, respectively. Additionally, our lightweight model is highly parallelizable, making it computationally efficient. Our contributions include a novel formulation of deep MVS as learning ray-based 1D implicit fields, the introduction of an epipolar transformer and a multi-task learning approach, and a challenging test set with evaluations focused on regions with specular reflection, shadow, or occlusion.
