Frame alignment is crucial for video restoration tasks such as video super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising. Deep learning-based methods have shown success in building temporal correspondences for frame alignment. Existing alignment methods can be categorized into independent alignment and progressive alignment. While independent alignment focuses on feature descriptors and motion estimation modules, progressive alignment uses a recurrent framework for gradual alignment. However, both strategies face challenges in estimating long-range motion fields and suffer from error accumulation. This paper proposes an iterative alignment module (IAM) that gradually refines shared sub-alignments, leading to more accurate alignments. IAM overcomes the limitations of the progressive alignment scheme by refining each sub-alignment iteratively and aligning neighboring frames individually. The proposed IAM also reduces computational complexity with a simple and efficient alignment unit for temporal sub-alignments. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves performance and inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art video super-resolution methods. Additionally, a non-parametric re-weighting module is introduced to evaluate the spatially-adaptive importance of frames, further enhancing alignment accuracy and temporal consistency. The contributions of this work include the iterative alignment scheme, the non-parametric re-weighting module, and the demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in video restoration tasks.
