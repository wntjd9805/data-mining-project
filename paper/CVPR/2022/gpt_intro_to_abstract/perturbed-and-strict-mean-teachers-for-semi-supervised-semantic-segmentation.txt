Semantic segmentation is a highly successful task in computer vision, but it requires large amounts of labeled data for training. However, labeling data is time-consuming and costly. As a result, the field of semi-supervised semantic segmentation has gained attention as a way to reduce the reliance on labeled data. This approach involves using a small set of labeled images and a larger set of unlabeled images, both drawn from the same data distribution. The challenge lies in effectively extracting useful training signals from the unlabeled images to improve the model's generalization beyond the limited labeled set.Current state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation models are based on consistency learning, which enforces agreement between different views of the unlabeled images. These different views can be obtained through various perturbations applied to the input image, the feature space, or the network itself. However, existing consistency learning methods assume accurate predictions for unlabeled images, which is not always met in practice. Moreover, consistency learning methods using strict cross-entropy loss can easily overfit prediction mistakes, leading to confirmation bias.In this paper, we propose a new approach to address the issue of prediction accuracy in consistency-based methods. We extend the mean teacher model with an auxiliary teacher and replace the mean square error loss with a stricter confidence-weighted cross-entropy loss. This enables us to make accurate predictions, allowing for more challenging perturbations such as input data, feature, and network perturbations to improve model generalization. Additionally, we introduce a new type of feature perturbation called T-VAT, which learns adversarial noise from both teachers and applies it to the student model, enhancing training effectiveness.Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed approach achieves the best results on widely used benchmark datasets such as Pascal VOC 2012 and Cityscapes. Our contributions include a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation model, improved segmentation accuracy through accurate predictions and stricter loss functions, a challenging combination of perturbations, and the introduction of T-VAT for feature perturbation. These advancements offer promising results in reducing the dependence on labeled data and improving the robustness and generalization of semantic segmentation models.
