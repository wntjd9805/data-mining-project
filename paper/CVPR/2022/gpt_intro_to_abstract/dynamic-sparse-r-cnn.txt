Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves predicting objects and their categories in an image. This task has applications in various domains such as surveillance and autonomous driving. Over the years, object detection has seen significant advancements in terms of feature extraction and detection pipeline designs. These advancements have led to the development of one-stage, two-stage, and multi-stage detection methods. One-stage detectors directly predict object categories and regression targets without refinement, while two-stage detectors generate candidate proposals before refining their location and category. Multi-stage detectors refine location and category multiple times but require high computational resources.One-stage detectors can further be divided into anchor-based and anchor-free detectors. Anchor-based detectors use predefined anchors to predict categories and refine coordinates, but choosing optimal anchor configurations can be challenging. On the other hand, anchor-free detectors overcome this issue by removing anchor design and using center points or regions within ground truth to define positive proposals.Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detectors have achieved significant performance improvements, but recently, Transformer-based detectors have been introduced. These detectors formulate object detection as a set prediction problem, using Transformer encoders and decoders to model object relationships and global image context. Hungarian algorithm is applied to find a matching between ground truths and predictions, and the label assignment is one-to-one during training.Inspired by CNN-based methods using many-to-one label assignment schemes, the authors propose dynamic label assignment (DLA) with many-to-one matching based on the optimal transport algorithm. This approach aims to optimize proposals more efficiently and improve detector training performance. They also introduce gradually increasing positive samples assigned to ground truths in the iterative stages of detection. Additionally, dynamic proposal generation (DPG) is proposed to provide better initial proposal boxes and features. In contrast to fixed proposals, DPG aggregates multiple parallel proposal experts that generate dynamic proposals specific to each sample.The proposed method, Dynamic Sparse R-CNN, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the COCO 2017 validation set, surpassing the Sparse R-CNN baseline by a substantial margin. The main contributions of this paper include implementing many-to-one label assignment in Transformer-based detection, introducing dynamic proposal generation, and integrating these dynamic designs into Sparse R-CNN.
