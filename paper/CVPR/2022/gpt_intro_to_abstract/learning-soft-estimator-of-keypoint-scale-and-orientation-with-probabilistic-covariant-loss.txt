Abstract:Keypoint-based image matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision applications. Maintaining keypoint feature invariance under geometric changes is challenging. Many existing methods estimate geometric change parameters and rectify local image patches. Predicting keypoint scale and orientation can effectively represent local geometric changes and improve matching accuracy. However, existing hand-crafted methods are not robust to complex scenes involving illumination changes or inessential patterns. Learning-based models have been proposed to improve adaptiveness, but they are limited in their ability to predict multiple scales or orientations. This paper introduces a soft learning-based estimator, S3Esti, which can predict multiple scales and orientations robust to complex scenes. S3Esti is implemented as a convolutional neural network and utilizes a novel probabilistic covariant loss function to train the network. An alternate optimization algorithm is also proposed to iteratively update the latent scale and orientation labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of S3Esti compared to existing estimators in terms of accuracy and robustness. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of S3Esti, the development of the probabilistic covariant loss function, and the design of the alternate optimization algorithm.
