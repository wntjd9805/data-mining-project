Multi-view data is commonly found in various real-world applications, where data is collected from different sources. Multi-view clustering (MVC) techniques aim to partition similar instances into the same group and dissimilar instances into different groups by utilizing the complementary information in multi-view data. However, as the number of views increases, the clustering performance of MVC models may degrade due to the introduction of both beneficial semantic features and meaningless noise. This phenomenon is observed in experiments, where conducting clustering on datasets with more views does not always lead to improved results. Moreover, single-view data can be considered a special case of multi-view, and applying multi-view models to new views may yield inferior results compared to single-view models. To address the issue of clustering performance degradation caused by view increase, this work proposes a new framework that guarantees a lower bound performance for MVC methods. The framework introduces the concept of safe multi-view clustering, which focuses on reducing the risk of performance degradation by automatically selecting features from single or multiple views. The proposed deep learning-based multi-view clustering framework combines clustering and representation learning to extract complementary information and discard noise from new views. The framework is formulated as an optimization problem and is guaranteed to achieve empirical safe multi-view clustering. It also discusses a special case under a divergence-based loss and proves its ability to achieve (ϵ, δ, δn)-expected safe multi-view clustering. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning mechanism in achieving safe multi-view clustering.
