Single image face relighting is a topic of significant interest in the computer vision and computer graphics communities. The ability to modify facial illuminations in consumer photos has driven the motivation behind this problem, as it has widespread appeal in photo editing. Additionally, face relighting has applications in Augmented Reality (AR) and face recognition.Previous relighting methods have made simplistic assumptions about light scattering and skin materials, which limited their ability to handle non-diffuse lighting effects such as hard shadows. This is problematic since many real-world light sources, including the sun, are best modeled as directional lights. To enhance photorealism in consumer photos and AR/VR, accurate modeling of hard shadows is necessary.One specific challenge in face relighting is the handling of hard shadows. Existing methods typically use smooth lighting conditions and are unable to synthesize realistic hard shadows. They also do not directly use estimated face geometry to generate geometrically consistent cast shadows. This can result in incorrect shapes of cast shadows, particularly those cast by the nose.To address this, we introduce a novel differentiable algorithm that utilizes ray tracing principles to estimate the locations of cast shadows. By leveraging estimated face geometry, our method can produce geometrically consistent hard shadows. We demonstrate that differentiably modeling hard shadows not only improves the realism of the relit image but also enhances the quality of estimated face geometry, especially in regions that produce hard shadows.In summary, our proposed method offers several contributions: a single image face relighting approach that produces geometrically consistent hard shadows, a differentiable algorithm for estimating facial cast shadows based on face geometry, state-of-the-art performance in relighting benchmarks under directional lights, and improved estimated geometry compared to models that assume diffuse shading.
