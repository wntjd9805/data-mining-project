Color image stitching is a crucial task in image processing, with applications in various fields such as remote sensing, virtual reality, and autonomous driving. However, generating high-quality stitched images remains challenging, especially in the presence of large parallax, low textures, moving objects, occlusions, or their combinations. This paper introduces an automatic color image stitching method to address these difficulties. The proposed method utilizes a quaternion rank-1 alignment (QR1A) model, which fully leverages color image information for precise alignment. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problem of QR1A. To evaluate image stitching performance, a perceptual seam quality (PSQ) measure is proposed to calculate misalignments along the seamline. Based on QR1A and PSQ, an automatic color image stitching (ACIS-QR1A) framework is presented, which learns the optimal seamline and local alignment simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACIS-QR1A produces high-quality stitched images in challenging scenarios. The rest of the paper reviews related work, presents the QR1A model, introduces the PSQ measure, explains the ACIS-QR1A framework, and concludes with experimental results and comparisons.
