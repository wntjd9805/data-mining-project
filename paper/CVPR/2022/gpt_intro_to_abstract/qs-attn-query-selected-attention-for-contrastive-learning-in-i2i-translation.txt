Abstract:Image-to-image (I2I) translation aims to map an input from one domain to another while preserving its original content. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism called Query-Selected Attention (QS-Attn) to improve the quality and efficiency of I2I translation. Our approach focuses on selecting anchor points that contain significant domain information and using them as queries to attend and absorb features at other locations. By quantifying the significance of the queries using an entropy-based metric and employing global attention for value routing, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various I2I tasks. The proposed QS-Attn mechanism retains the simplicity of existing approaches while enhancing translation accuracy and reducing the training cost. Extensive experiments on commonly used datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.
