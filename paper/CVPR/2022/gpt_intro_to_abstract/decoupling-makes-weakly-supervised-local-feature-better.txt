Finding pixel correspondences is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Sparse local feature methods have been widely used to find correspondences in various applications such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), structure from motion (SfM), and visual localization. Traditional sparse local feature methods follow a detect-then-describe pipeline where keypoints are detected and descriptors are then generated using patches centered at these keypoints. Early methods focused on the detection step, while later works focused on the description step and sought to design powerful descriptors. Recently, deep learning approaches have been explored to replace or enhance the detect-then-describe pipeline using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These methods achieve better performance by jointly training the description network and detection network within a single CNN. However, these methods require dense ground-truth correspondence labels for training, which can be expensive to collect. To address this limitation, self-supervised and weakly supervised learning approaches have been investigated. Self-supervised learning methods use a single image and a virtual homography to generate image pairs for training, while weakly supervised learning methods use weaker forms of supervision such as camera poses or landmark labels. However, directly applying weakly supervised learning to the joint training pose cannot produce satisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a decoupled training describe-then-detect pipeline for weakly supervised local feature learning. Our approach decouples the detection network from the description network, allowing the detection network to rely on a good descriptor for accurate keypoint detection. We demonstrate that our decoupled training pipeline significantly improves the performance of weakly supervised local features. We also propose a line-to-window search strategy to exploit the weak supervision of camera poses for descriptor learning. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets and bridges the gap between fully and weakly supervised methods.
