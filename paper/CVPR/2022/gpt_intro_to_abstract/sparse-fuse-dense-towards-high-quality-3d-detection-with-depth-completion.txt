This paper introduces a new approach to address the limitations of current 3D detection methods based on LiDAR point clouds. The sparsity of point clouds hampers their performance in distant and occluded regions. To overcome this, the paper proposes a more fine-grained RoI fusion strategy, called 3D-GAF, which fuses 3D RoI features instead of 2D RoI features. This approach improves object part correspondences in 2D images and 3D point clouds, providing more accurate 3D bounding box generation. The paper also addresses the issue of insufficient data augmentation in multi-modal methods. Traditional data augmentation approaches are difficult to apply to 2D image data, limiting the performance of multi-modal methods compared to single-modal methods. To solve this problem, the paper introduces SynAugment, a synchronized augmentation method that treats images as 3D pseudo point clouds, allowing for more flexible data augmentation techniques. Additionally, the paper presents CPConv, a feature extractor that efficiently extracts both image features and geometric features from pseudo point clouds. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, the paper conducts extensive experiments and achieves first place on the KITTI car 3D object detection leaderboard. The findings of this research contribute to the development of improved 3D detection methods for autonomous driving applications.
