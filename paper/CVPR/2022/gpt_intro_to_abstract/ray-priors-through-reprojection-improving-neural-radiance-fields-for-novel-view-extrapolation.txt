This paper investigates the use of neural rendering techniques for efficient and photo-realistic rendering of virtual worlds. While physics-inspired graphics techniques have made progress in real-time rendering and image synthesis, they require extensive manual content generation. Neural rendering, particularly Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), has emerged as a promising approach for synthesizing realistic images from 3D scenes. However, NeRF's main limitation is the requirement of a large number of images to reconstruct scene geometry and texture details. This paper focuses on object reconstruction using NeRF and specifically addresses the challenge of high-quality rendering for novel viewpoints that differ significantly from the training data.The authors propose RapNeRF, a solution that leverages the multi-view consistency property in NeRF's formulation. They introduce a random ray casting policy that generates supervisions for potential unseen views using seen views. This strategy, combined with the use of target objects' rough 3D meshes (R3DMs), improves the rendering quality for novel viewpoints. Additionally, the authors explore the tradeoff between view-dependent effects and multi-view consistent renderings and introduce a ray atlas computed from the training ray's viewing directions.To evaluate the performance of RapNeRF, the authors construct the Synthetic-NeRF* dataset by re-splitting the synthetic training and test images of NeRF's objects. They also capture real-world scenes using a mobile phone to create the MobileObject dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RapNeRF in synthesizing high-quality novel views compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the core components of RapNeRF.One limitation of RapNeRF is the tradeoff between view-dependent effects and novel view exploration performance. The authors propose studying the deferred NeRF architecture as a potential remedy for this tradeoff. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of neural rendering techniques for efficient and realistic rendering of virtual worlds.
