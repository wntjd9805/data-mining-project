Dynamic 3D point clouds are widely used in various applications, but acquiring high-temporal-resolution (HTR) point cloud sequences is challenging and costly. In this paper, we propose a computational method to construct HTR point cloud sequences from low-temporal-resolution (LTR) sequences. We highlight the differences between this problem and 2D video frame interpolation and discuss the challenges posed by the unordered and irregular nature of 3D point cloud data. We also evaluate existing deep learning-based interpolation methods and identify their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose IDEA-Net, an end-to-end deep interpolation framework that consists of a dual-branch structure and a two-step learning process. IDEA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative and visual performance. Our contributions include a new formulation for temporally interpolating dynamic 3D point cloud sequences and a symmetric and coarse-to-fine network for reconstructing HTR sequences with large non-rigid deformation.
