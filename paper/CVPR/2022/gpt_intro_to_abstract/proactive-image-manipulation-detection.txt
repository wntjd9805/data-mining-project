This paper introduces a proactive scheme for image manipulation detection in response to the growing concerns over the authenticity of shared images due to advances in image manipulation techniques. The focus is on detecting partial image manipulation, which is considered a greater risk as it alters the semantics of real images. Previous methods for manipulation detection have been largely passive and often overfit to specific manipulation methods and datasets, limiting their generalization capabilities. To address this, the paper proposes a proactive scheme that adds an imperceptible signal (template) to captured images, which improves the generalization of manipulation detection. The algorithm accurately distinguishes between encrypted real images and their manipulated counterparts by recovering the added template. A template estimation framework is introduced to learn a set of orthogonal templates, overcoming challenges such as the lack of ground truth templates and the risk of reverse engineering. Different loss functions are defined to incorporate properties like small magnitude, high frequency content, orthogonality, and classification ability in learning the template set. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in manipulation detection, showing higher performance and improved generalization across 12 different generative models. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of the proactive scheme, the learning of a template set, and the demonstration of superior manipulation detection compared to prior works.
