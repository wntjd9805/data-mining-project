The development of camera and display equipment has led to the increasing resolution of images, such as 4K and 6K resolutions becoming common. While this provides opportunities for various applications like portrait photo post-processing and medical diagnosis, it also presents challenges for classical image segmentation methods. These challenges include the computational expense and GPU memory consumption of dealing with a significant number of pixels in ultra high-resolution images, as well as the lack of fine-grained details in existing up-sampling techniques.Previous segmentation refinement methods have primarily focused on images with lower resolutions, and only a few have attempted to handle ultra high-resolution refinement based on low-resolution masks. These methods typically employ a cascade scheme in the decoder to upsample intermediate refinement results in discrete resolution stages. However, this approach is time-consuming and lacks efficiency.To address these issues, we propose the Continuous Refinement Model (CRM) for ultra high-resolution segmentation refinement. CRM exploits the concept of continuity to make decoding more efficient while also facilitating the learning process for upsampling resolution. The model utilizes a coarse mask from low-resolution segmentation and extends it using continuous local representation, similar to classical super-resolution tasks. However, adapting implicit function approaches for high-resolution segmentation refinement is non-trivial due to differences in training image resolution, the need for more multi-level semantic features, and the resolution gap between training and testing.CRM offers several advantages, including reduced computational cost and improved reconstruction of fine details. It is suitable for use with low-resolution training images and ultra high-resolution testing images, and even with refining from low to high-resolution, it achieves inference times less than half of existing methods. In experimental evaluations, CRM demonstrates the best segmentation results on ultra high-resolution images and also enhances the performance of state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation models without requiring fine-tuning.
