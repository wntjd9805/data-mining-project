Deep fully-supervised pose estimation has been successful in detecting keypoints on humans, but these detectors are limited to specific species and body parts. In contrast, humans can easily recognize and generalize keypoints on different animals with only a few examples. Inspired by few-shot learning, we propose Few-shot Keypoint Detection (FSKD) which can learn from a few keypoints and recognize previously unseen keypoint types and species. FSKD has various applications such as labelling, face alignment, fine-grained visual recognition, and animal behavior analysis. We propose a versatile FSKD approach that can handle different levels of domain shift in training and testing data. We address the challenges of limited annotations, variability of samples, interference noise, and local patterns in images by modeling the uncertainty of localization. Our FSKD model builds keypoint prototypes and uses keypoint-specific attentive features for localization. We introduce auxiliary keypoints and model the covariance between main and auxiliary keypoints to improve generalization. Our contributions include a flexible FSKD model, uncertainty modeling, multi-scale localization, and the use of auxiliary keypoints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting novel keypoints on unseen species. Our work is the first attempt to model keypoint detection as few-shot learning.
