This paper introduces a new gating scheme called adaptive gating for single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-based LiDAR systems. SPADs are sensors with single photon sensitivity that are commonly used in LiDAR systems for 3D sensing applications. However, these systems face challenges due to background photons from ambient light, known as pile-up, which can interfere with the detection of signal photons from the LiDAR laser. To mitigate pile-up, gating mechanisms are used to selectively activate and deactivate the SPAD at specific time intervals. Previous work has proposed fixed gating and uniform gating schemes, but they have limitations. In this paper, the authors present the adaptive gating scheme that combines a probabilistic model for SPAD-based LiDAR detection times with the Thompson sampling algorithm for sequential experimental design. This allows the gating scheme to select optimal gating sequences based on depth information available at any given time. The authors also introduce a variant of the adaptive gating scheme that adapts exposure time to achieve target depth accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the adaptive gating scheme can significantly reduce depth estimation error or acquisition time, and can leverage prior depth information from spatial regularization or RGB images. The code and data for this research are provided for reproducibility and follow-up research.
