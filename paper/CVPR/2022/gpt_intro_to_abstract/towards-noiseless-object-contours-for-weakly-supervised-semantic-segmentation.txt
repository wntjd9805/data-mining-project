Semantic segmentation has advanced significantly in recent years due to the development of deep neural networks. However, the annotation required for training these networks is expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) techniques have been adopted, including the use of image-level labels. Image-level labels are easier to obtain but do not provide detailed localization or shape information for objects. Existing approaches typically use Class Activation Maps (CAM) to estimate object localization maps and generate pseudo labels for training. However, CAM often produces incomplete and sparse object estimates. To improve the accuracy and completeness of the object estimates, some methods have explored various strategies to expand the CAM, but these methods may still not provide sharp estimates of object shape. In this paper, we propose the Segmentation-assisted Noiseless Contour Exploration (SANCE) model, which combines an auxiliary segmentation module with a contour module to explore object contours with less noise. The segmentation module provides high-level semantic information to the contour module, and the refined segmentation map is used to generate online labels for the contour module. The online labels improve the accuracy of object shape estimation and suppress noisy intra-object edges. Experimental results demonstrate that our SANCE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 benchmarks in terms of mean intersection over union (mIoU).
