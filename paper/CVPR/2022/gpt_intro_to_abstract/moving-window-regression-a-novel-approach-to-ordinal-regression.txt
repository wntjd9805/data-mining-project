Ordinal regression is an important task in computer vision, used in various applications such as facial age estimation and historical color image classification. However, accurately predicting ranks is challenging due to the lack of clear distinctions between ranks in many cases, such as variations in facial characteristics during the aging process. Extensive research has been conducted to address this issue, with approaches like local regressors and order learning. In this paper, we propose a novel ordinal regression algorithm called moving window regression (MWR). We introduce the concept of relative rank (ρ-rank) to quantify ordinal relations between input and reference instances. The ρ-regressor, composed of an encoder and a regression module, is developed to estimate the ρ-rank. The MWR process involves iteratively refining the rank estimate by selecting two reference instances and estimating the ρ-rank within a moving search window centered around the previous estimate. Local ρ-regressors are also developed to handle diverse characteristics in different rank groups.Our contributions include introducing the notion of ρ-rank and designing ρ-regressors for its estimation. We propose the MWR algorithm, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets for facial age estimation and HCI classification. Notably, MWR outperforms other methods in 17 out of 19 benchmark tests for facial age estimation. This work advances the field of ordinal regression and provides a reliable approach for accurate rank estimation in computer vision tasks.
