This paper explores efficient architecture design for bottom-up human pose estimation, a critical technique in computer vision applications. Existing bottom-up models primarily focus on high-computation regions, making them unsuitable for edge devices. To address this issue, the authors propose LitePose, a single-branch architecture with a modified MobileNetV2 backbone. They introduce fusion deconv head and large kernel conv techniques to handle scale variation in a computationally efficient manner. The authors conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating LitePose's effectiveness in reducing MACs and latency compared to state-of-the-art models. The contributions of this work include the discovery that high-resolution branches are redundant in the low-computation region and the introduction of LitePose as an efficient architecture for bottom-up pose estimation.
