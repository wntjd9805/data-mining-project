Environmental perception using 3D LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous systems to achieve robustness and security. Previous research has focused on designing network architectures to extract semantic information from point cloud data. However, the inherent symmetry of LiDAR point clouds has not been explored. In this paper, we propose Azimuth Normalization (AziNorm) to exploit the radial symmetry of point clouds. By normalizing sub point clouds along the radial direction, AziNorm reduces data variability and improves perception performance. AziNorm can be easily incorporated into existing LiDAR-based perception methods without modification. Experimental results on object detection and semantic segmentation tasks show that AziNorm significantly improves the performance of SECOND, PV-RCNN, and KPConv methods. Additionally, AziNorm enhances data efficiency and accelerates convergence. It can achieve superior results even when trained with only 10% of the data or training epochs. This reduction in data requirements can significantly lower the cost of data acquisition and labeling, making it valuable for data-driven autopilot systems. The proposed AziNorm method contributes to exploit the radial symmetry of point clouds and enhance the performance and efficiency of LiDAR-based perception methods.
