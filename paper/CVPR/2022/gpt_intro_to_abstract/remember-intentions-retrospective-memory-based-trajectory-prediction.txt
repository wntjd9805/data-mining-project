Trajectory prediction is a critical task in various fields such as autonomous driving, drones, surveillance systems, and interactive robotics. Previous approaches have used parameter-based models to summarize past-future instances and make predictions. However, these models lack interpretability and may include irrelevant instances, affecting performance. To address these issues, we propose MemoNet, inspired by human retrospective memory. MemoNet utilizes a memory bank to store representative instances and a memory addresser to search for similar instances. We introduce four key designs in MemoNet, including joint-reconstruction-based feature learning, memory filtering, trainable memory addresser, and intention clustering. Our two-step trajectory prediction system leveraging MemoNet achieves superior performance on three datasets. We contribute MemoNet as an instance-based framework for future intention prediction, along with novel designs and experimental evaluation that demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our approach.
