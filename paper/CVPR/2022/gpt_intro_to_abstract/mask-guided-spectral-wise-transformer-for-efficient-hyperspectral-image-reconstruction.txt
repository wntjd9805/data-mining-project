Hyperspectral imaging technology allows for the capture of rich and detailed information about a scene by capturing data at multiple spectral wavelengths. These hyperspectral images (HSIs) have been widely used in various computer vision applications, such as remote sensing, object tracking, and medical image processing. Traditional imaging systems with spectrometers, however, are time-consuming and are not suitable for capturing dynamic scenes. In recent years, researchers have turned to snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems, with coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) emerging as a promising research direction. Numerous reconstruction algorithms have been proposed for recovering the 3D HSI cube from the 2D measurement obtained by CASSI. Conventional model-based approaches use hand-crafted priors but suffer from limitations in generalization, reconstruction quality, and restoration speed. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown impressive results in HSI reconstruction but struggle to model inter-spectra similarity and long-range dependencies effectively. Moreover, existing CNN-based methods do not fully exploit the guidance effect of the physical mask used in CASSI. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Mask-guided Spectral-wise Transformer (MST) for HSI reconstruction. MST leverages the power of the Transformer model, originally developed for natural language processing, to capture non-local similarity and long-range dependencies. We introduce the Spectral-wise MSA (S-MSA) module to capture the inter-spectra dependencies in HSIs. Additionally, we develop a Mask-guided Mechanism (MM) to direct the attention of S-MSA to regions with high-fidelity spectral representations. Our MST models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art methods, requiring fewer computational resources. Our contributions include the introduction of the MST method, the S-MSA module, and the MM mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MST through extensive simulations and real-world experiments in HSI reconstruction.
