Advanced image editing techniques are highly sought after in various applications, such as colorizing old photos, repairing damaged regions, and blending multiple images. Recent advancements in generative networks have significantly reduced the skill barriers for using image editing tools. For instance, users can now easily transform any photo into the style of a famous painter by providing one of the painter's own works. This paper introduces Conditional Image Repainting (CIR), a novel approach to "free" users from requiring professional skills while still empowering them to realize their creative ideas for image editing. CIR focuses on three key components: texture, color, and geometry. By manipulating these components, users can achieve their desired image edits. The proposed method aims to provide a user-friendly and accessible approach to advanced image editing, without compromising on the creative freedom of users.
