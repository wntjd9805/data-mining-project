Single prediction neural networks have been widely used in computer vision tasks, but there is an increasing need for capturing uncertainty in estimation tasks to address over-confidence and ambiguity. Bayesian Neural Networks and ensembles have been proposed as methods for uncertainty estimation, but ensembles have drawbacks such as increased cost and difficulty in model introspection. In this paper, we propose a structured uncertainty prediction network (SUPN) that approximates the output of an ensemble by predicting a mean and covariance for a multivariate Gaussian distribution. This allows for tasks such as sampling, conditioning, and model introspection. We highlight the limitations of previous methods and demonstrate the advantages of our approach. We also evaluate our method in the context of depth estimation and show that it performs comparably to ensembles while providing a compact representation of uncertainty. Our explicit representation enables conditional sampling and visualizing the learned correlation structure.
