This work addresses the cold-start anomaly detection problem for visual inspection of industrial image data. The task is to detect unusual patterns in images where the expected defect variations are not fully specified. This problem is inherently an out-of-distribution detection problem, where a model needs to distinguish between normal examples and samples outside its support. Industrial visual defect classification is challenging due to the variability of errors, ranging from subtle changes to larger structural defects. Previous work in this area relies on auto-encoding methods, GANs, or other unsupervised adaptation methods. However, these approaches have limitations in terms of adaptation to the target distribution and limited matching confidence at higher abstraction levels. In this paper, we propose PatchCore, a method that maximizes nominal information available at test time, reduces biases towards ImageNet classes, and retains high inference speeds. PatchCore utilizes locally aggregated, mid-level feature patches to classify an image as anomalous based on the presence of a single anomalous patch. This allows PatchCore to operate with minimal bias towards ImageNet classes and retain sufficient spatial context. To reduce redundancy and storage memory, PatchCore introduces greedy coreset subsampling for nominal feature banks. Experiments on the MVTec AD and Magnetic Tile Defects (MTD) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PatchCore for industrial anomaly detection. PatchCore achieves state-of-the-art image-level detection scores, reducing detection errors by more than half compared to previous methods. It also shows excellent industrial anomaly localization performance. Furthermore, PatchCore demonstrates high sample efficiency, achieving comparable performance using only a fraction of the nominal training data. Overall, PatchCore is a practical and attractive solution for industrial anomaly detection.
