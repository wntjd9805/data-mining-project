Abstract: This paper introduces a lossless image compression framework called Lossless Compression with Frequency Decomposition Network (LC-FDNet) to address the growing need for high-quality images. The framework utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) and takes into account both lossy and lossless image compression techniques. While lossy compression is preferred in general, lossless compression is necessary for applications involving medical images, scientific images, technical drawings, and artistic photos. The LC-FDNet framework consists of Adaptive Frequency Decomposition (AFD), Low-Frequency Compressor (LFC), and High-Frequency Compressor (HFC). It decomposes an image into subimages and compresses them sequentially, with the first subimage being compressed using a conventional lossless compressor. The AFD decomposes each subimage into low and high-frequency regions and the compressors (LFC and HFC) encode these regions differently. The low-frequency region, which is typically well predicted, is compressed first, followed by the high-frequency region with additional priors obtained from the encoded low-frequency pixels. The AFD utilizes an adaptive thresholding scheme based on error variance to classify pixels into low and high-frequency regions. By deriving threshold values based on image properties, the frequency decomposition process becomes image-specific, improving compression performance. Experimental results show that the proposed LC-FDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark high-resolution datasets while maintaining reasonable inference time. The main contributions of this paper are the proposed lossless image compression framework, the adaptive frequency decomposition process, and the achieved state-of-the-art performance on high-resolution datasets.
