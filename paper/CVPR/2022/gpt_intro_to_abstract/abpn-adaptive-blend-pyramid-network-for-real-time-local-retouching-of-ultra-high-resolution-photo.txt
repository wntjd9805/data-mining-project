This paper focuses on the task of local photo retouching (LPR), which involves editing specific regions in a photo while keeping the rest of the image unchanged. While existing methods in photo retouching primarily manipulate the attributes of the entire image, such as color and illumination, few methods address the local region. This paper identifies three main challenges in the LPR task: accurate localization of the target region, local generation with global consistency and detail fidelity, and efficient processing of ultra high-resolution images. Existing methods in image-to-image translation and local image editing have limitations in addressing these challenges. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel adaptive blend pyramid network (ABPN) for local retouching of ultra high-resolution photos. The ABPN consists of a context-aware local retouching layer (LRL) and an adaptive blend pyramid layer (BPL). The LRL performs local retouching on a thumbnail of the high-resolution image, while the BPL expands the LRL outputs to the original size of the input. The ABPN incorporates a local attentive module (LAM) to capture the local semantics and texture of the target region and a light-weight adaptive blend module (ABM) for fast expansion and detail fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ABPN outperforms existing methods in terms of retouching quality and processing efficiency. Furthermore, a high-definition cloth retouching dataset (CRHD-3K) is introduced to facilitate research in LPR. The contributions of this work include the proposed ABPN framework, the LAM and ABM modules, and the CRHD-3K dataset.
