The synthesis of visual patterns is a widely used technique in computer-aided design and digital content creation. This paper introduces the desirable characteristics for synthesized visual patterns, including authenticity, diversity, and scalability. The paper proposes formulating the synthesis problem as generating patterns from a continuous, real coordinate space, known as the implicit formulation. Stationary patterns, which can be expanded by tiling or stacking blocks of elements, are analyzed and recreated in a stationary framework. The paper explores the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN) to model stationary patterns and addresses the challenges of scale and alignment. The paper proposes a novel approach using an implicit periodic generator to model stationary patterns, matching the repeatable structure to a learnable continuous periodic function. This design choice allows for the synthesis of visually authentic results and provides flexibility in learning a distribution from randomly shifted patches. The paper introduces the Implicit Periodic Field Network (IPFN) and demonstrates its effectiveness in texture image synthesis and 3D volume synthesis. The paper concludes with future directions and an ablation study to validate the proposed design choices.
