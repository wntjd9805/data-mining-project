This paper introduces Mask Transfiner, an efficient transformer-based approach for high-quality instance segmentation in computer vision. While object detection paradigms have advanced, accurately predicting segmentation masks remains a challenge. The paper highlights the performance gap between object detection and segmentation and the need for improvements in mask quality. Mask Transfiner proposes to address these issues by identifying error-prone regions, sparsely located along object boundaries or in high-frequency regions. The paper presents a hierarchical quadtree approach to represent and process these regions, and a refinement network based on the transformer architecture. The network consists of three modules: node encoder, sequence encoder, and pixel decoder. Mask Transfiner outperforms existing methods in terms of high-quality instance segmentation and computation efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.
