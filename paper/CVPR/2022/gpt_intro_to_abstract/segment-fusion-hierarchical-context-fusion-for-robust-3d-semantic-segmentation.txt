The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the importance of 3D semantic segmentation in scene understanding applications such as autonomous driving and virtual reality. It highlights the challenges of part-misclassification in existing methods and the need for accurately estimating object instance boundaries. The paper proposes a hierarchical fusion approach using a graph segmentation algorithm and a learnable attention-based network called Segment Fusion. The method aims to improve the performance of semantic segmentation models by effectively fusing semantic and instance information at different levels of granularity. The proposed approach is adaptable to different datasets and backbones, allows for end-to-end training, and demonstrates up to 5% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on datasets like ScanNet and S3DIS. A comparison with an iterative clustering method also shows a 1-2% improvement in semantic segmentation.
