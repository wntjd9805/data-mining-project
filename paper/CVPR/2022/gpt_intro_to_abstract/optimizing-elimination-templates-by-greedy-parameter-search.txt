This paper focuses on the efficient solving of minimal problems in 3D reconstruction and camera tracking, which can be formulated as systems of polynomial equations. The current state-of-the-art approach uses symbolic-numeric solvers based on elimination templates. These solvers consist of an offline phase where a template is constructed and an online phase where the template is used to solve specific problems. The online phase needs to be computed quickly for robust optimization, making it crucial to have small and numerically stable templates. In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to constructing elimination templates for efficient solving of minimal problems. They use a syzygy-based parameterization and apply a greedy heuristic optimization to find the smallest possible template. The authors demonstrate their method on 34 minimal problems in geometric computer vision, finding templates that are as small or smaller than the state-of-the-art. In some cases, their templates are significantly smaller than previous approaches. Additionally, experiments on synthetic data show that the new solvers are fast and numerically accurate.The authors also propose a practical solver for the problem of relative pose estimation with unknown common focal length and radial distortion. Previous solvers for this problem have been slow or numerically unstable. This paper presents a more efficient and stable solution to this problem.
