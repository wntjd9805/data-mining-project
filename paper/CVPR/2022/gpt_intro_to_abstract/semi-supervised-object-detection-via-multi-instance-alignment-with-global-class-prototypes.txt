Deep learning has achieved remarkable performance in object detection tasks, but acquiring labeled data for each object category is costly and labor-intensive. Fortunately, there is a large amount of unlabeled data available from social media and websites. Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) aims to improve the generalization ability of object detectors by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled images. Existing SSOD approaches usually employ consistency-based or pseudo-labeling-based strategies. Consistency-based approaches minimize inconsistency between predictions of unlabeled data with perturbations, while pseudo-labeling-based approaches use teacher-student frameworks to estimate pseudo-labels for unlabeled images. However, these approaches individually train the student detector with labeled and unlabeled data, without considering their relation. This paper introduces a Multi-instance Alignment model with Global Class Prototypes (MA-GCP) that leverages labeled images to improve SSOD. MA-GCP estimates prediction consistency of unlabeled images using reliable information learned from all labeled images. It represents each class by a global class prototype, updated with all labeled instances. Class distributions of unlabeled images' proposals are computed based on visual similarity to global class prototypes, and consistency is enforced through the cross-entropy loss. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MA-GCP outperforms competing models and achieves state-of-the-art results. The main contributions of this work are the proposal of MA-GCP to enhance prediction consistency in pseudo-labeling-based SSOD, the use of global class prototypes learned with all labeled images to estimate reliable prediction consistency, and the consistent improvement and state-of-the-art results achieved by the MA-GCP approach.
