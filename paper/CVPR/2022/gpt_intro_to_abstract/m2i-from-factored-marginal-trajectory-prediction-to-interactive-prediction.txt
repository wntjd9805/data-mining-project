Trajectory prediction is an important component of intelligent driving systems. Many existing trajectory prediction works focus on individual agents and fail to consider their interactions in the future, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose M2I, a framework that leverages marginal and conditional trajectory predictors to efficiently predict scene compliant multi-agent trajectories. M2I approximates the joint distribution using a product of marginal and conditional distributions, assuming two types of agents: the influencer and the reactor. The influencer behaves independently while the reactor reacts to the behavior of the influencer. We use a standard marginal predictor to generate prediction samples for the influencer and a conditional predictor to roll out future trajectories for the reactor. We also propose a relation predictor to classify interactive relations at inference time. Our experiments demonstrate that M2I achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark.
