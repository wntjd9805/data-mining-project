This paper introduces the concept of few-shot open-set recognition (FSOR), which aims to address the challenges of recognizing both positive and negative queries in scenarios with limited labeled data. Traditional recognition systems assume a predefined set of classes with sufficient labeled data, but in real-world applications, collecting labeled data is expensive and there may be unknown classes in the testing samples. Few-shot learning (FSL) techniques adapt recognition systems to new classes with very few labeled instances, but still hold a closed-set assumption. Open-set recognition (OR) methods handle out-of-distribution samples but rely on large amounts of data. However, applying OR methods to few-shot scenarios results in degraded performance. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a model for FSOR that can accept and recognize positive queries with few labeled samples and detect negative queries from undisclosed classes. Previous FSOR methods use threshold-based negative detectors, but choosing an appropriate threshold is challenging as it depends on different few-shot classes and tasks. In this paper, the authors propose integrating threshold tuning into the learning process by extending the few-shot classifier with negative prototypes. These prototypes are generated by a negative generator using meta-learning, allowing them to serve as task-adaptive rejection boundaries for different FSOR tasks. A query is rejected if its prediction scores on all few-shot classes are lower than on the negative prototype. The paper also introduces the concept of conjugate tasks in FSOR and a conjugate training strategy to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks for both FSOR and generalized FSOR (GFSOR) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The contributions of this paper include a threshold-free solution for FSOR, a study of negative prototype generator design, an optimal solution involving task-level knowledge for negative envision, and the formulation and effective solution for the GFSOR problem. The paper concludes with a discussion of related literature and the experimental analysis and results of their approach.
