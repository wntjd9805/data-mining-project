Crowd counting plays a crucial role in various applications, including video surveillance and traffic control. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, crowd counting is also essential for monitoring social distancing and curbing the spread of the disease. Most existing methods for crowd counting rely on regressors to estimate the local crowd density in individual images and then integrate these density estimates to produce people counts. The regressors commonly employ techniques such as Random Forests, Gaussian Processes, or Deep Networks. However, training these deep networks in a supervised manner requires extensive ground-truth annotation, which is expensive, time-consuming, and poses privacy concerns.To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel approach to self-supervision for cross-domain crowd counting. The proposed method combines synthetic images with their corresponding labels and unlabeled real images to train a deep network. The network is trained to learn perspective-aware features on real images, enabling it to predict its own uncertainty. To achieve this, a variant of the ensemble method is used to effectively utilize pseudo labels obtained from the network's confidence estimates.The training process consists of two phases. In the first phase, the network is trained to yield satisfactory results on synthetic images and to determine the orientation (upside-up or upside-down) of real images. This self-supervision approach encourages the network to learn perspective-aware features on real images. In the second phase, the network's uncertainties in estimating people densities are utilized to provide pixel-wise self-supervision. The confident density estimates are treated as pseudo labels and used to re-train the network iteratively until convergence.The contribution of this work is a novel self-supervision approach that leverages stochastic density maps with uncertainties instead of deterministic maps. The method also explicitly accounts for the impact of perspective distortion on density counts in crowd counting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cross-domain crowd counting.
