This paper addresses the challenge of generating 3D shapes that not only have geometric and visual plausibility but also functional validity. While existing approaches focus on the former, functionality is often a key purpose of 3D design. Ignoring functionality can result in severe artifacts and limit the utility of generated content in real-world applications. To overcome this challenge, the authors propose leveraging physical simulation to guide generative models in producing functionally valid shapes. However, incorporating physical simulation into generative modeling is challenging due to its non-differentiability and computational complexity. Previous works have sidestepped these challenges by utilizing offline simulation or surrogate models, but these approaches sacrifice the benefits of end-to-end training. The authors exploit recent advances in differentiable physical simulators to develop an online simulation-based physical supervision approach, which addresses the limitations of previous methods. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through the integration of a simulation layer into a generative network and the training of a deep generative model with online physical simulation. The proposed model, Phys-DeepSDF, exhibits higher generalization power compared to methods trained with offline simulation and enables various applications, including accurate shape generation and optimization. The main contributions of this paper include the development of a differentiable rigid-body simulator for 3D shape decoding, the integration of the simulation layer into a generative model, and the demonstration of the efficiency and quality improvements achieved through online physical simulation.
