The goal of human motion prediction in computer science is to forecast future motions based on previous observations. While there has been progress in deep human pose estimation, motion prediction still poses challenges. Most existing approaches treat each pose sequence as independent, disregarding the potential influence of other people's motions. In this paper, we introduce the task of collaborative motion prediction, which aims to jointly predict the motions of two individuals involved in an interaction. To support research in this area, we collected the ExPI dataset, which consists of professional dancers performing highly synchronized Lindy Hop aerial steps. We propose the Cross-Interaction Attention (XIA) module, which leverages historical motion data of both individuals to guide their predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods for short-term and long-term predictions. Our contributions include the definition of the collaborative motion prediction task, the creation of the ExPI dataset, and the introduction of the XIA module as a baseline method.
