Machine learning has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. However, interpretability is critical in determining the reliability of predictions made by machine learning models, especially in high-stakes applications. In the field of computer vision, research has been focused on developing image classifiers that are both accurate and interpretable. These models combine the power of deep learning with the interpretability of case-based reasoning. They learn a set of prototypes from training images and make predictions by comparing parts of the input image with the learned prototypes.However, existing prototype-based models for computer vision use spatially rigid prototypes, which fail to account for geometric transformations or pose variations of objects. Inspired by recent work on modeling geometric transformations in convolutional neural networks, this paper presents a deformable prototypical part network (Deformable ProtoPNet). The Deformable ProtoPNet is a case-based interpretable neural network that incorporates spatially flexible deformable prototypes. Each prototype is composed of prototypical parts that can adaptively change their relative spatial positions based on the input image. This flexibility allows the prototypes to detect object features with higher tolerance to spatial transformations. As a result, the Deformable ProtoPNet can explicitly capture pose variations and improve both model accuracy and the richness of explanations provided.The main contributions of this paper are: 1. The development of the first prototypical case-based interpretable neural network that provides spatially flexible deformable prototypes. 2. The introduction of angular margins to the training algorithm, leading to improved accuracy of case-based interpretable neural networks. 3. The demonstration of the state-of-the-art accuracy achieved by the Deformable ProtoPNet on the CUB-200-2011 bird recognition dataset and the Stanford Dogs dataset.Overall, this paper proposes a novel approach to achieve accurate and interpretable image classification by integrating deformable prototypes into case-based neural networks.
