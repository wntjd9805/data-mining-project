Non-rigid shape correspondence is a significant problem in 3D shape analysis, with applications ranging from statistical shape analysis to deformation or texture transfer. Previous approaches have focused on learning informative features or modeling shape correspondence as a semantic segmentation problem. However, these approaches impose little consistency between individual point correspondence predictions and may be sensitive to shape discretization. More recent techniques aim to predict and impose a training loss on the entire map between shapes using the functional map representation. This representation encodes a map as a small matrix using spectral eigen-basis. While this approach reduces the need for extensive training data, it allows for both orientation-preserving and orientation-reversing correspondences. In most practical scenarios, orientation-preserving correspondences are desired. Existing state-of-the-art learning networks require supervised loss or rigid pre-alignment to disambiguate symmetries. In this paper, we propose an architecture using the complex functional map representation, which aligns tangent vector fields. Our approach is fully orientation-aware and restricts correspondences to globally orientation-preserving maps. We introduce losses adapted to complex functional maps and demonstrate that our network can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner, without relying on rigid pre-alignments or ground truth correspondences. Our approach provides a novel and informative signal for non-rigid shape analysis tasks.
