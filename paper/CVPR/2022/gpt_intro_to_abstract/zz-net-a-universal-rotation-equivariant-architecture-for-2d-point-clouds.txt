This paper discusses the need for interpreting and processing point clouds in various application areas such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and robotics. It highlights the importance of permutation symmetry and rotation equivariance when designing neural networks for point cloud input. The concept of equivariance is formally defined, and the paper focuses on the group SO(2) Ã— Sm, considering functions that are invariant to permutations and equivariant to rotations. Furthermore, the paper introduces new results and neural network architectures for clouds of pairs of points, or correspondences. The limitations of the work are acknowledged, but the importance and applicability of SO(2)-equivariance are emphasized. The main contributions of the paper include describing a dense set of equivariant functions on 2D point clouds, presenting a neural network architecture for approximating the function space, and extending the architecture to cover rotations and permutations for pairs of point clouds. The architecture is tested on rotation estimation and essential matrix estimation problems in stereo vision.
