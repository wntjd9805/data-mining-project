Concrete structure health monitoring is crucial in various industries, with crack damage classification being a critical stage. Automated testing methods are needed to recognize and repair cracks before serious deterioration occurs, reducing maintenance costs. However, crack recognition in real-world industrial environments is extremely challenging due to the inconsistent sizes and irregular shapes of cracks, as well as the presence of background noise. Deep learning technology has shown promise in crack recognition, but traditional CNN-based methods struggle to extract discriminative features in realistic environments. This paper proposes a novel geometry-aware guided loss (GAGL) to enhance the discriminative power of deeply learned features. GAGL reduces intra-class feature variation and increases inter-class feature separation by pulling deep features of the same class towards the feature that has the largest geometric distance from the class boundary. The paper introduces a feature-based geometry-aware projected gradient descent method (FGA-PGD) to approximate the geometric distances of features to class boundaries. Additionally, a geometry-aware update rule is developed to optimize anchor points, which approximate features with the largest geometric distances to class boundaries. The objective function of GAGL aims to optimize the distances between anchors and features closer to class boundaries. The contributions of the paper include the proposal of FGA-PGD for approximating geometric distances efficiently and GAGL for enhancing discriminative power. A labeled dataset, NPP2021, is also introduced to facilitate research on crack recognition tasks in the presence of noisy backgrounds and inconsistent crack sizes.
