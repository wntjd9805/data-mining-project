Real-world data often exhibit class imbalance, with a significant difference in the number of samples between classes. This can lead to biased models that struggle to accurately recognize minority classes and tend to overfit on majority classes. One simple approach to address this class imbalance is oversampling the minority classes. However, indiscriminate oversampling can worsen overfitting by generating samples with limited diversity and similar image contexts. This paper introduces a novel context-rich oversampling method that aims to overcome these limitations. The proposed method leverages the information-rich majority class samples to generate new minority samples. It crops objects from the minority class in various sizes and pastes them onto images from the majority classes, creating diversified images with rich backgrounds. By interpolating between majority and minority samples, the proposed method generates data around the decision boundary, improving generalization performance for minority classes. To implement this method, the paper adopts the CutMix image-mixing data augmentation technique. However, naive use of CutMix may lead to overfitting on majority classes. Therefore, the paper addresses this issue by sampling background images and foreground patches from different distributions to achieve the desired minority oversampling.The contributions of this work include the proposal of a context-rich minority oversampling method that utilizes the rich context of majority classes, requiring minimal additional computational cost and easy integration into existing deep learning algorithms. The paper demonstrates that applying this oversampling method to commonly used loss functions can lead to significant performance improvements and achieve state-of-the-art results without the need for architectural changes or complex algorithms. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, this study offers a useful and universal minority oversampling method for long-tailed classification research.
