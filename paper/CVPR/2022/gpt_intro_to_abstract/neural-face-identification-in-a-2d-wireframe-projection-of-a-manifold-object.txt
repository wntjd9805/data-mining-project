This paper addresses the problem of converting 2D line drawings into 3D objects in computer-aided design (CAD). The conversion of 2D line drawings into 3D solid models is essential for analysis, simulation, and manufacturing purposes. One crucial step in this process is face identification, which involves finding loops of edges that correspond to the faces of the 3D object. While some satisfactory solutions exist for specific cases, such as objects with genus 0 and 3-connected drawings, the task becomes challenging for general manifold objects with complex geometry and topology. The challenges arise from the algorithmic complexity of searching through all possible face loops, as well as the inherent ambiguity in reconstructing 3D objects from 2D projections. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a data-driven approach using deep neural networks. They train a deep neural network to detect faces in 2D line drawings by leveraging a large collection of 3D objects and their corresponding 2D projections. By learning from ground truth 3D data, the model can generate plausible solutions and resolve the inherent ambiguity. The face identification problem is formulated as a sequence generation task, and a variant of the Transformer model is employed to predict the co-edge index forming a face at each timestamp. The detected faces are classified into different types, such as planes and cylindrical surfaces. The proposed model achieves high precision and recall on a public dataset. Additionally, a simple convex optimization scheme is developed to reconstruct structured 3D models from a single 2D line drawing using the detected faces. The contributions of this work include the introduction of a data-driven approach to face identification and the study of its advantages and disadvantages compared to existing geometry- and topology-based methods. The paper also presents a scheme for reconstructing 3D models from 2D line drawings using the face identification results. These findings open up opportunities for incorporating learning-based approaches into established CAD pipelines and improving the accuracy and efficiency of 3D model reconstruction.
