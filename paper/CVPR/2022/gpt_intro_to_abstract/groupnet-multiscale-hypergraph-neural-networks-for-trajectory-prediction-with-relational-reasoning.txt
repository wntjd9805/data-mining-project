Multi-agent trajectory prediction is a crucial task in various real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and human behavior understanding. It involves predicting future trajectories of agents based on their past movements. To accomplish this task, it is important to consider three factors that affect an agent's dynamics: ego momentum, instantaneous intent, and social influence from other agents. While the first factor has been extensively studied and the second factor is unpredictable, the focus of this work is on modeling and reasoning the interactions among agents to understand social influence.Previous works have attempted to capture interactions through social operations, graph-based modeling, and attention mechanisms. However, these methods often overlook the importance of relational reasoning. Some prior research has made progress in explicit relational reasoning, but there are limitations in terms of modeling group-wise interactions and explicitly reasoning interaction intensity.To address these limitations, this paper proposes GroupNet, a novel multiscale hypergraph neural network for capturing social interactions in trajectory prediction. GroupNet leverages a multi-scale hypergraph to model group-wise interactions with multiple group sizes. Instead of using handcrafted designs, the hypergraph topology is learned in a data-driven manner. The interaction embedding is represented using a three-element format, including neural interaction strength, neural interaction category, and per-category function.Through extensive synthetic physics experiments, GroupNet demonstrates strong relational reasoning abilities and is able to capture group behaviors, infer interaction strength, and categorize interactions without requiring relation supervision. GroupNet can be easily integrated into prediction frameworks, improving their performance. It significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of existing state-of-the-art models on various real-world prediction benchmarks.In summary, the main contributions of this paper include the proposal of GroupNet, a multiscale hypergraph neural network for modeling complex social influences in trajectory prediction, validation of its relational reasoning abilities through synthetic simulations, and demonstration of its performance improvement when integrated into existing prediction frameworks. GroupNet enables accurate prediction of multi-agent trajectories by capturing both pair-wise and group-wise interactions and reflecting interaction strength and category.
