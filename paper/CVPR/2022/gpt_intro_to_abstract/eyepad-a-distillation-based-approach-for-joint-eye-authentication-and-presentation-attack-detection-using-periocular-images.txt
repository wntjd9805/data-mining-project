Eye Authentication (EA) using irises has become a popular method for biometric authentication. However, EA systems are vulnerable to Presentation Attacks (PA) that aim to deceive the system with artificial eye images. In this paper, we propose strategies to develop a single deep network for both EA and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) using periocular images. We investigate techniques to perform EA and PAD without any active pre-processing, which can be computationally expensive for edge devices. We introduce a user-to-user verification protocol that considers both left and right eyes, which is more practical than the existing eye-to-eye verification protocol. Additionally, we propose two knowledge distillation-based techniques called Eye-PAD and EyePAD++ to incrementally learn EA and PAD tasks and minimize the forgetting effect in multitask learning. We also introduce a new metric called Overall False Rejection Rate (OFRR) to evaluate the system's performance. Our proposed methods consistently outperform existing baselines for multitask learning in terms of OFRR. We validate our approach across different network backbones and image quality degradation scenarios. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in joint EA and PAD tasks.
