Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the perception and visual quality of low-light images captured in poor lighting conditions. Traditional LLIE methods, such as histogram equalization (HE)-based and retinex-based methods, are simple but often fail to restore consistent colors and detailed textures. With the success of deep neural networks (DNN) in various vision tasks, deep LLIE methods have achieved significant improvements. However, these methods still struggle with color consistency and can produce unnatural and inconsistent colors.This paper addresses the issue of color inconsistency in deep LLIE methods and proposes a new "divide and conquer" collaborative strategy. The main contributions of this work are as follows: 1) A deep color consistent network (DCC-Net) is introduced to enhance the illumination of low-light images while retaining color consistency. DCC-Net is the first work to directly explore color consistency in LLIE. Experimental results demonstrate that DCC-Net produces more natural and consistent color enhancements.2) DCC-Net incorporates a decoupling strategy to separate a color image into a gray image and a color histogram for collaborative LLIE. Three sub-networks, namely G-Net, C-Net, and R-Net, are designed to recover the gray image, learn color distributions, and restore the normal-light image, respectively.3) To address the lack of spatial information in color histograms, a pyramid color embedding (PCE) module is proposed. The PCE module consists of six color embedding (CE) sub-modules with a pyramid structure. CE matches color and content features based on their affinities, reducing the color gap between the enhanced image and ground-truth image.Overall, this paper presents a new strategy to retain color consistency in LLIE and introduces DCC-Net, which achieves better illumination enhancement and produces more natural and consistent color enhancements. The proposed decoupling strategy and PCE module further improve the performance by incorporating spatial information and dynamically incorporating color information.
