Point clouds are widely used in various applications, and with the advancements in 3D scanning technology, large point cloud datasets with complex geometries can now be efficiently captured. Consequently, point cloud compression has become crucial for storage and transmission. In order to achieve favorable compression ratios, the community has primarily focused on lossy compression methods. However, there is still a need to determine which properties of point clouds should be preserved given limited bitrate budgets.In this paper, we argue that local density is an important characteristic of point clouds that should be preserved during compression. Existing methods that ignore local density often result in artifacts such as uniform distribution or clustered points, especially when the bitrate is low. Preserving density leads to fewer outliers and smaller reconstruction errors. Additionally, point clouds captured in real-world scenarios are rarely uniformly distributed, and losing local density means losing important traits such as scanning resolution and occlusion. Moreover, point clouds are often processed or simplified to be denser in regions of interest or complex geometry, and preserving density during compression ensures that more budget is allocated to these regions. Lastly, significant differences in density between the compressed and raw point clouds can impact downstream applications such as semantic segmentation.We propose a novel density-preserving deep point cloud compression method that achieves superior rate-distortion trade-off compared to existing approaches, while preserving local density. Our method utilizes an auto-encoder architecture trained with an entropy encoder end-to-end. On the encoder side, we design three types of feature embeddings to capture local geometry distribution and density. On the decoder side, we introduce sub-point convolution to promote feature diversity during upsampling, and learnable number of upsampling points with scale offsets in different regions to mitigate the clustered points issue.We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its ability to be extended to jointly compress attribute information such as normals. Overall, our proposed method addresses the challenge of preserving local density during point cloud compression and achieves superior compression performance compared to existing approaches.
