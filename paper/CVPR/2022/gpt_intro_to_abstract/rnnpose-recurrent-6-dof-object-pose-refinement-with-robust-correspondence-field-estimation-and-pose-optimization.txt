6-DoF object pose estimation is a critical task in various applications such as augmented reality, robotic manipulation, and autonomous driving. However, accurately estimating the pose of an object from a single color image is a challenging problem due to variations in illumination and occlusions. Recent methods have incorporated pose refinement procedures to improve estimation performance, either using depth sensors and the ICP algorithm or RGB-based refinement techniques. While these approaches have shown promising results in ideal scenarios, their performance becomes less stable in practical situations. To address these limitations, we propose a recurrent object pose refinement framework called RNNPose. Our framework is robust to erroneous initial poses and occlusions. We formulate the pose optimization as a non-linear least squares problem based on estimated correspondence fields between a rendered reference image and an observed image. The correspondence fields are estimated using a network inspired by optical flow techniques. To handle occlusions, we introduce a 3D-2D hybrid network that generates distinctive descriptors for the 3D object model and observed 2D images. These descriptors are used to downweight unreliable correspondences during pose optimization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and is publicly available.
