GAN-based methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in various computer vision tasks, including image generation, style transfer, and text-to-image translation. However, the potential misuse of these methods has raised concerns, leading to the development of techniques for detecting GAN-generated images. Spatial domain methods that employ large neural network-based detectors have shown promising results in detecting fake images. More recently, detectors based on the artifacts in the frequency spectrum of GAN-generated images have been proposed, offering improved performance with fewer parameters compared to spatial domain-based detectors. However, these frequency spectrum-based detectors can be compromised when GAN-generated images undergo specific methods. The effectiveness of these methods lies in the noticeable anomalies present in the frequency domain, categorized as abnormal spectral patterns and power distribution discrepancies. Different GAN models exhibit distinct artifact patterns in their frequency spectra, which can be exploited to generate more effective fake images that can evade spectrum-based detectors. This paper investigates mainstream spectrum-based fake image detectors and proposes two methods to mitigate the intensity of artifact patterns and correct power discrepancies in the spectra of GAN-generated images. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in the performance of spectrum-based detectors, highlighting their vulnerability to malicious operations on fake image spectra. In contrast, spatial domain-based detectors remain relatively robust in detecting enhanced fake images. These findings caution the image forensic community against relying solely on spectrum-based fake image detection methods.
