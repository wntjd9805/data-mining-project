In recent years, there have been numerous publications on differentiable renderers, including OpenDR, Neural 3D Mesh Renderer, and SoftRas. These renderers enable various computer vision applications such as pose estimation, shape optimization, 3D reconstruction, and style transfer. The choice of the underlying 3D representation distinguishes different classes of differentiable renderers. This study focuses on differentiable 3D mesh renderers but acknowledges the applicability of the investigated aspects to other rendering concepts. Differentiable mesh renderers can be constructed using an exact and hard renderer with approximate surrogate gradients or an approximate renderer with natural gradients. This work introduces a generalized differentiable renderer (GenDR) and explores the relationship between the choice of probability distribution and the type of rendering. The study also discusses the aggregation function used in approximate differentiable renderers and generalizes the renderer to accommodate various continuous t-conorms. A total of 1,242 concrete differentiable renderers are benchmarked and evaluated on shape optimization and camera pose estimation tasks. The study identifies existing differentiable renderers as instances of the generalized renderer and provides an analysis of their performance. The contributions of the study include the proposal of the generalized renderer, the identification of existing renderers as instances, the proposal of suitable sigmoid functions and t-conorms, and the extensive benchmarking and analysis of differentiable renderers.
