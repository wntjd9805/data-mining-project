This paper introduces a two-stage human-object interaction (HOI) detector that improves upon existing methods by incorporating unary and pairwise encodings. HOI detectors are used to localize and classify interactive human-object pairs in images. The detector proposed in this paper utilizes the DETR model as the backbone and refines its output features with additional transformer layers for HOI classification. The unary encoder layer encodes individual human and object instances separately, while the pairwise encoder layer encodes human-object pairs jointly. This encoding strategy allows the model to reason about unary appearance and pairwise spatial information in a complementary manner. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and training efficiency, consuming less time and memory. The incorporation of pairwise box positional encodings into the transformer architecture is also highlighted as a key contribution of this research. Overall, the proposed model demonstrates improved performance in HOI detection while reducing computational resources required for training.
