Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a task that aims to identify the same person across different cameras in a surveillance network. Extracting discriminative view-invariant features from person images is crucial for successful Re-ID. Significant progress has been made with existing methods that utilize cross-camera images of each person during training. However, in realistic scenarios where cross-camera person images are not guaranteed, collecting a large amount of camera-specific images of different persons is a more viable solution. This paper addresses the challenging setting of ISolated Camera Supervised (ISCS), where cross-camera image pairs do not exist during training. Existing methods fail to perform well in this setting, leading to the proposal of a novel pipeline called CCSFG. CCSFG explicitly generates cross-view samples in the feature space to improve encoder learning. The proposed method includes a joint optimization of the encoder and generator, as well as a novel generative model called σ-Regularized CVAE (σ-Reg. CVAE) to ensure stable joint learning. The effectiveness of CCSFG is demonstrated by achieving state-of-the-art performance on two ISCS person Re-ID benchmark datasets.
