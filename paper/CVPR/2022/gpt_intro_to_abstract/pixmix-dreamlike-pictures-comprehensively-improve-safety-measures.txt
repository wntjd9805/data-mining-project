In the field of machine learning, ensuring the reliability and safety of models in real-world applications is a fundamental challenge. Deployed models should not only perform well on the training data but also exhibit robustness to distribution shifts, consistency in predictions, resilience against adversaries, calibrated uncertainty estimates, and the ability to detect anomalies. Past research has approached these problems individually but they can be viewed as different aspects of ML Safety. These properties can be considered as safety measures and the ideal scenario is to have models that excel in multiple safety measures. However, optimizing for certain desirable properties often comes at the expense of others. For example, improving adversarial robustness through adversarial training might negatively impact classification performance. Similarly, achieving consistent predictions on out-of-distribution inputs may conflict with accurate detection of such inputs. In this paper, we introduce PIXMIX, a data processing method that aims to comprehensively improve safety measures. We present experiments comparing PIXMIX with other augmentation methods and demonstrate significant improvements across multiple safety measures. Previous augmentation methods introduce limited additional complexity, while PIXMIX utilizes fractals and feature visualizations to actively expose models to new sources of structural complexity. By incorporating these complex "dreamlike" images, PIXMIX enhances both robustness and uncertainty estimation, and notably, it outperforms existing baselines in all safety measures. We argue that increasing structural complexity is an important yet under-explored axis in data augmentation techniques, as opposed to simply increasing entropy or descriptive difficulty. PIXMIX represents a Pareto improvement as it achieves better performance across all safety measures rather than trading improvements in certain measures for degradation in others. Code for PIXMIX is available for further exploration and experimentation.
