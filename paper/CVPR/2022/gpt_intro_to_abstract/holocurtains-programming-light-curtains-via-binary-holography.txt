Light curtains are widely used in various applications, such as elevators, garage doors, and hazardous environments, to detect the presence or absence of objects within 3D space. Traditional light curtains rely on direct line-of-sight illumination where an emitter is positioned to directly illuminate a receiver. However, configuring these curtains for specific environments is a time-consuming task. Recently, a programmable approach using triangulation was introduced to generate light curtains. By illuminating a scene with a laser line and measuring the response with a line scan camera or rolling-shutter camera, a 3D line representing the intersection of the illumination and sensing planes is obtained. This approach offers the ability to program the shape of the curtain and operate under strong ambient light. However, the current systems are limited to ruled surfaces and have constraints on the positions of the laser and scan lines.In this paper, we present a novel approach to structured illumination that allows for the generation of light curtains with arbitrary shapes. By replacing the laser line with a high-speed projector capable of generating arbitrary illumination patterns using 2D computer-generated holography, we achieve higher light efficiency compared to conventional projectors. When synchronized with a rolling-shutter camera, our system can generate light curtains of any shape. We also introduce a spatial multiplexing strategy to capture the response from multiple curtains in a single image. Additionally, our approach enables new applications such as optical disturbance detection and 3D optical touch sensing.The contributions of our work include the development of a holographic light curtain technique capable of generating curtains with arbitrary shapes, a spatial multiplexing strategy for capturing responses from multiple curtains in a single image, and the use of high-speed and light-efficient 2D holography for structured lighting. This research opens up possibilities for advanced safety applications and navigation in unknown environments.
