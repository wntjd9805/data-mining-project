LiDAR scene flow estimation is a crucial task in 3D scene understanding for autonomous driving and computer vision applications. Unlike optical flow estimation, scene flow estimation from LiDAR sensor data involves aggregating unordered data, posing an extra challenge. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed for scene flow estimation, with two main categories based on 2D convolution and 3D convolution methods. While 2D convolution methods convert 3D point clouds into 2D representations, 3D convolution methods directly operate on unordered point cloud data. Existing approaches such as HPLFlowNet and FlowNet3D achieve scene flow estimation through deep hierarchical feature learning and correlation embeddings, but are not optimal for large displacements. PointPWC-Net addresses this issue by utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy, estimating large displacements at low resolution and refining at high resolution. However, it suffers from error accumulation. In this paper, we propose a LiDAR scene flow estimation pipeline that incorporates direct multi-body rigidity constraints and employs an error awarded optimization strategy, minimizing point-metric error to update scene flow. We train our network in a weakly supervised manner using binary background mask and ego-motion, and our experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the introduction of direct multi-body rigidity constraints to a GRU-based recurrent neural network, the proposed error awarded optimization strategy, and the evaluation of our method on different datasets.
