Predicting the future motion of uncontrolled agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous systems. This is particularly important in the context of self-driving cars, where the ego-vehicle needs to interact with other road users such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. However, predicting human behavior accurately is challenging due to the uncertainty and inconsistency exhibited by humans. Previous works on human driving behavior prediction were not precise enough for autonomous vehicles' motion planning. To address this limitation, researchers have developed phenomenological methods that learn the behavior of agents from data.In an autonomy stack, the trajectory prediction module is followed by a planning module that uses the predicted trajectories of surrounding agents to plan the ego-motion. Besides prediction accuracy, there are other requirements for the overall system performance. These include compatibility between trajectory predictions for different agents, tractable joint trajectory prediction for scenes with multiple agents, time consistency to ensure smooth motion plans, and conditional prediction for motion planning and understanding agent interactions.In this paper, we propose ScePT, a trajectory forecasting method that generates joint trajectory predictions for multiple interacting agents. Our approach predicts the futures of agent cliques instead of individuals or the scene as a whole. We present a neural network architecture that enables this prediction. Additionally, we introduce a policy network that autoregressively rolls out closed-loop trajectory predictions, considering agent-to-agent interactions and mapping them to control inputs. We also enhance the output sample diversity by incorporating a tunable risk measure into our loss function.When evaluated on real-world pedestrian and driving datasets, ScePT demonstrates its capability to capture scene-level multimodality, improve scene consistency, enable counterfactual analyses, and support simulation, downstream planning, and verification of autonomous vehicle performance.
