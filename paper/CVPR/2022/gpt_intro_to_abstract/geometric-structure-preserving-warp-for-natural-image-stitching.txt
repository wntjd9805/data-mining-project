Abstract:The demand for high-quality panoramic images is increasing with the popularity of multimedia devices. However, producing high-quality panoramic images is still a challenge due to wide baselines, large parallax, and low-texture in complex stitching scenes. Existing stitching methods mainly rely on single or multiple feature-based alignment, but they may result in excessive perspective transformations and affect the overall naturalness of the stitching result. Joint alignment of point and line features has shown promise in improving the estimation of homography transformations for image stitching. However, these methods often neglect the critical structure of the scene, including curve constraints. In this work, we propose a curve structure-based stitching model to better preserve the geometric structure compared to methods based on point and line features. Our method combines the advantages of local alignment and global similarity transformations to obtain more natural stitching results. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art structure-preserving methods in terms of stitching quality.
