Vanishing point detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in camera calibration, 3D reconstruction, object detection, wireframe parsing, and autonomous driving. Traditional methods rely on geometric priors for line segment clustering, but it is challenging to determine the group to which a line segment belongs solely based on geometric information. This ambiguity can be resolved by incorporating image context. In this work, we propose a novel method called Transformer based line segment classifier (TLC) for real-time vanishing point detection in the Manhattan world. TLC uses a line segment descriptor to represent line segments as 1D feature vectors, which are then processed by a clustering network and a scoring network based on the Transformer encoder architecture. The locations of the vanishing points are calculated using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based on the clustered line segments and predicted scores. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TLC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capability. Additionally, we introduce a real-world street view vanishing point (SVVP) dataset for further evaluation. Our method achieves a runtime of 25 FPS on an NVIDIA 2080Ti card, making it suitable for real-time applications.
