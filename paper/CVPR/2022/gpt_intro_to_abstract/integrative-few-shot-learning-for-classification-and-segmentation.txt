This paper introduces the concept of few-shot learning, where a learner only has access to a limited number of examples for supervision. Specifically, the paper focuses on few-shot classification (FS-C) and few-shot segmentation (FS-S) in computer vision. However, these two problems have typically been treated separately, and the conventional setups for FS-C and FS-S do not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, the paper proposes the task of integrative few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS), which combines FS-C and FS-S into a multi-label and background-aware prediction problem. The authors introduce the integrative few-shot learning (iFSL) framework, which constructs shared foreground maps for both classification and segmentation. They also design the attentive squeeze network (ASNet) to compute semantic correlations and transform them into foreground maps. The efficacy of the iFSL framework and ASNet architecture is demonstrated through extensive experiments, showing significant improvements in classification and segmentation accuracy compared to other methods. The paper also explores the task transferability between FS-C, FS-S, and FS-CS learners, showing that FS-CS learners effectively generalize when transferred to FS-C and FS-S tasks. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancement of few-shot learning in computer vision by introducing the FS-CS task and proposing effective solutions through the iFSL framework and ASNet architecture.
