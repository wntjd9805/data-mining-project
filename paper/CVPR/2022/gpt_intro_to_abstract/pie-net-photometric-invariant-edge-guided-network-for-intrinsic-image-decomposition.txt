This paper introduces the problem of Intrinsic Image Decomposition (IID), which involves recovering the individual components of an image, such as reflectance and shading. The reflectance image can be used for various applications, such as texture edits, fabric recoloring, or semantic segmentation, while the illumination image can be used for relighting or shape-from-shading. Previous approaches to IID have employed priors and constraints to tackle the inherently ill-defined problem. However, these imposed constraints may limit the applicability of these methods. Recent deep learning-based approaches offer more flexibility but may suffer from dataset bias. In this paper, an edge-driven hybrid approach using Cross Color Ratios (CCR) gradients is proposed. CCR gradients are illumination invariant and only dependent on albedo changes. The proposed method utilizes global and local refinement layers to address hard negative illumination transitions. The two-staged approach improves performance compared to single parameter space learning. The algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates good generalization capabilities.
