This paper introduces a novel approach to invisible information hiding in display/print-camera scenarios, aiming to make QR codes more aesthetically pleasing while still being detectable by mobile devices. The process involves encoding information in images, displaying/printing them, capturing the images with a camera, locating the encoded information, and decoding it. The main challenge lies in recovering the hidden information from photos with geometric distortions caused by the camera imaging process. Existing methods require preprocessing to locate the encoded image's four vertices and rectify the image from different perspectives. This paper proposes a CNN-based end-to-end framework that automatically locates the hidden information using invisible markers, eliminating the need for manual or visible markers. The proposed model consists of an encoder, a distortion network, a localization network, and a decoder. The encoder hides information in a sub-image, and the distortion network processes the distorted sub-image for decoding. The localization network learns to detect the invisible markers generated by the encoder, enabling the correction of geometric distortions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving both invisibility and detectability of hidden codes. This paper's contributions include the introduction of an architecture for invisible information hiding, the development of a localization module for invisible markers, and a multi-stage training strategy to optimize the trade-off between detectability, recovery accuracy, and visual invisibility.
