This paper addresses the problems of incremental few-shot object detection (iFSOD) and instance segmentation (iFSIS). The goal is to achieve successful object detection and instance segmentation on both new and base classes, even when access to old training data becomes unavailable. The paper presents iFS-RCNN, a modified version of Mask-RCNN, which first pre-trains on abundant examples of base classes and then fine-tunes on a few examples of new classes. iFS-RCNN addresses the challenges of data paucity for new classes and prevents the base classes from being "forgotten". The paper introduces two key contributions: (1) learning a distribution of the classification head's weights on the new classes using a probit-based approximation, and (2) estimating the uncertainty of bounding-box localization on the new classes and using it for bounding-box refinement and loss weighting. iFS-RCNN outperforms existing approaches in few-shot object detection and instance segmentation tasks on the COCO dataset, achieving higher COCO AP rates for both new and base classes compared to the state of the art. The paper also reports results on the LVIS dataset, which has more classes and long-tailed class distributions.
