Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical imaging technique that provides detailed information about tissue structure and function without the need for ionizing radiation. However, obtaining high-resolution MR images in certain areas of the body, such as the abdomen, can be challenging due to limitations in imaging systems and the presence of crepitations. Furthermore, the lengthy acquisition process can lead to patient discomfort and introduce motion artifacts, thereby affecting image quality. Super-resolution (SR) reconstruction, which aims to enhance image quality without hardware upgrades, has emerged as a promising solution.MRI can generate multi-contrast images, such as T1-weighted (T1), T2-weighted (T2), proton density weighted (PD), and fat-suppressed proton density weighted (FS-PD), each offering complementary information. To improve the quality of low-resolution (LR) images, it is possible to leverage a high-resolution (HR) reference image with a shorter acquisition time. However, existing methods for multi-contrast MRI SR reconstruction still face challenges in effectively extracting features from reference and target images, as well as transferring these features. Several recent studies have used CNNs and GANs for multi-contrast SR reconstruction, but they fail to adequately address the challenges in these two crucial steps.This paper proposes a novel network called the McMRSR network, which utilizes transformers to extract long-range dependencies and facilitates comprehensive contextual matching for multi-contrast MRI SR. Swin Transformer groups are employed to capture deep features at different scales and contrasts, enabling the capture of detailed anatomical structures in complex regions. The network also incorporates multi-scale contextual matching and aggregation schemes to transfer visual contexts from reference images to target LR MR images at different scales, enhancing the guidance information and producing SR images with fine details. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets (clinical pelvic, clinical brain, and fastMRI) demonstrate that McMRSR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed network shows great potential for clinical applications, improving the quality of MR images and aiding in diagnostic accuracy.
