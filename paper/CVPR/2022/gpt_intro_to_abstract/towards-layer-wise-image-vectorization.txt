Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) have become increasingly popular in computer graphics due to their compact file size, resolution-independency, and provision of layer-wise topological information. However, existing image-to-vector translation methods often overlook this topological information, leading to inadequate learning and the need for additional shape primitives. Some methods attempt to address this issue but have limitations. In this paper, we present a model-free method called LIVE that translates raster images to SVGs with layer-wise representation. LIVE does not require shape primitive labels and can be applied to various domains. To improve topology exploration, we introduce a component-wise path initialization method and a novel Unsigned Distance guided Focal loss function (UDF loss). We also mitigate the self-interaction issue by introducing a Self-Crossing loss (Xing loss) with constraints on control point optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that LIVE generates precise and compact SVGs across different domains, surpassing previous works in terms of simplicity and layer-wise topology. Our contributions include the LIVE method, initialization method, and novel loss functions, all of which improve SVG generation from raster images.
