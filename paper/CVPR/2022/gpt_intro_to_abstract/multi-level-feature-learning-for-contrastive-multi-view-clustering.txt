Abstract:Multi-view clustering (MVC) has gained significant attention due to the advantages it offers in learning from multi-view or multi-modal data. Traditional MVC methods, based on traditional machine learning techniques, have limitations in representation ability and computational complexity. In recent years, deep MVC methods have emerged as a popular approach due to their superior representation ability. These methods can be categorized into two-stage and one-stage methods. However, existing MVC methods still face challenges in effectively learning common semantics and avoiding misleading view-private information. In this paper, we propose a new framework called Multi-level Feature Learning for Contrastive Multi-view Clustering (MFLVC) to address these challenges. MFLVC is designed to avoid fusion of adverse view-private information and generate different levels of features for each view. We leverage autoencoders and multi-layer perceptrons to learn low-level features, high-level features, and semantic labels. We introduce contrastive learning to achieve reconstruction and consistency objectives in different feature spaces, mitigating the conflict between these objectives. Our method surpasses previous works in exploring common semantics, improving clustering effectiveness, and achieving robustness to hyper-parameter settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFLVC outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods.
