Object detection has seen great progress in recent years with the development of computer vision and deep learning techniques. Most existing works follow an offline training paradigm, where models are trained on a dataset and evaluated on a test set with a similar distribution. However, in real-world applications, online training on streaming data is more important, especially for large-scale industrial systems. Additionally, artificial intelligence systems are expected to continually learn different skills without starting from scratch each time. Continual learning, or lifelong learning, is a solution that aims to sequentially solve non-stationary tasks without a drop in performance on previously seen tasks. This requires an elastic model that can continuously acquire new knowledge while preserving existing knowledge.While there have been studies on continual image classification, few have focused on continual object detection due to the challenges of localizing and recognizing multiple objects of diverse scales in streaming tasks. Existing approaches for continual object detection use knowledge distillation or exemplar replay methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods suffer from domain shift or capture biased knowledge. In this work, the authors propose a different approach that stores knowledge directly via a sparse and dynamic framework. They introduce a unified detector shared by sequential tasks, and task-aware gates are designed to automatically determine which sub-models should be activated for specific tasks. A soften-and-discretize strategy is proposed for gate learning to avoid difficulties in jointly optimizing binary gates and channel weights. The previous knowledge is stored in the weights of the sub-models, and cross-task knowledge can be shared by their overlapped channels. The authors also propose a Prototypical Task Correlation Guided Gating Mechanism to balance sharing existing knowledge and exploiting exclusive knowledge. This mechanism adaptively adjusts the diversity of gates based on class-specific prototypes to activate more gates for tasks with significant domain gaps.The proposed method, called ROSETTA, is evaluated on both task-based and class-based continual object detection scenarios. It outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of mean average precision (mAP) on various datasets. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed gating mechanism successfully achieves an equilibrium between sharing knowledge and exploiting exclusive knowledge by capturing prototypical cross-task correlation.
