Image cropping is a popular technique used to improve image composition, and automatic image cropping techniques have been developed to make it accessible to amateurs and non-specialists. Previous methods typically incorporate expert knowledge, such as the "Rule of Thirds," into cropping models but may lack the ability to learn intricate features. In recent years, data-driven approaches utilizing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged. These approaches can be categorized into anchor evaluation methods and coordinate regression methods. Anchor evaluation methods assign quality scores to pre-defined cropping anchors, allowing users to select multiple crops. However, these anchors may not encompass all the good crops globally. On the other hand, coordinate regression methods use a global view to cover all possibilities, but they only predict one crop, potentially overlooking other good crops. To address these limitations, we propose a novel perspective by treating image cropping as a set prediction problem. Our model incorporates learnable anchors and bipartite matching to regress diverse crops directly. Additionally, we employ the Hungarian algorithm to address the inequality between the number of pre-defined anchors and the labeled good crops. To overcome the inconsistency between the regressed crops and the validity labels, we introduce two label smoothing methods based on quality scores and self-distillation. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in achieving both globality and diversity in image cropping.
