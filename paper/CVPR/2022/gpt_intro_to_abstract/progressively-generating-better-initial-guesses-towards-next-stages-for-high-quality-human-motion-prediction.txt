Human Motion Prediction (HMP) is a widely studied research topic with applications in various fields such as intelligent security, autonomous driving, and human-robot interaction. Previous approaches to HMP have utilized different models like nonlinear Markov models, Gaussian Process dynamical models, and Restricted Boltzmann Machines. More recently, deep learning methods have shown promising results in HMP. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been commonly used to handle the sequential nature of pose sequences, but they often suffer from problems like discontinuity and error accumulation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also been explored, treating pose sequences as images, but the effectiveness of 2D convolutions is limited due to the irregularity of poses. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as a suitable method for HMP, treating poses as a graph and using GCNs to learn spatial relations between joints. Many recent GCN-based approaches share similar preprocessing steps, using an extended input sequence and extended output sequence to improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-stage prediction framework that utilizes recursively smoothed results of the ground truth target sequence as intermediate targets, progressively improving the initial guess for better prediction accuracy. We also introduce S-DGCN and T-DGCN, which extract global spatiotemporal features to enhance prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches significantly.
