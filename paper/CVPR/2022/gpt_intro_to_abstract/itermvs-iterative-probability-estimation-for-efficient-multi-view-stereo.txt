Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a technology used to reconstruct dense 3D models from calibrated images. It is a critical problem in geometric computer vision and has applications in augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. However, real-world scenarios present challenges such as occlusion, changes in lighting, low-textured areas, and non-Lambertian surfaces that traditional methods struggle to overcome. Recent data-driven approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown improved performance on various MVS benchmarks. One popular method, MVSNet, constructs a 3D cost volume and uses a 3D CNN to regularize it and regress the depth map. While MVSNet performs well on benchmarks, it does not scale well to high-resolution images or large-scale scenes due to the memory and run-time requirements of the 3D CNN. This paper proposes IterMVS, a novel GRU-based iterative method aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of high-resolution MVS. The contributions of this work include a lightweight GRU-based probability estimator that encodes the per-pixel probability distribution of depth in its hidden state, an effective depth estimation strategy that combines classification and regression, and competitive performance on various MVS datasets while demonstrating high efficiency in memory and run-time. Compared to PatchmatchNet, IterMVS achieves better efficiency and generalization ability.
