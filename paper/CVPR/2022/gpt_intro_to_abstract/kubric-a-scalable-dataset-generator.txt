This paper introduces Kubric, an open-source pipeline for generating realistic image and video data with rich ground truth annotations for various vision tasks. The use of synthetic data is advocated to overcome challenges faced in collecting and curating sufficient amounts of data, such as expense, data diversity, and control over task domain complexity. Synthetic data has been proven effective for benchmark evaluation and training in tasks such as 3D human pose estimation, facial landmark detection, and semantic segmentation. However, software tools for data generation are less mature compared to those for architecture design and training. Kubric addresses this issue by providing a general framework for photo-realistic generation, supporting reuse, replication, and shared assets at scale. It offers a simple Python API, tools for generation at scale, and a common export data format for porting data into training pipelines, along with rich annotations for various vision tasks. The versatility of Kubric is demonstrated through the creation of 13 datasets for new vision challenge problems, showcasing its capabilities in 3D NeRF models and optical flow estimation. The Kubric framework enables large-scale data generation, running seamlessly on thousands of machines and producing terabytes of data. The source code and datasets are made available for further exploration and usage.
