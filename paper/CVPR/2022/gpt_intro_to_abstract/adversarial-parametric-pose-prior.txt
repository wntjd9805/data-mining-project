The SMPL model is widely used for parameterizing body poses and shapes, but it does not always generate realistic human bodies when random values are passed as inputs. To address this issue, various approaches have been used, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) learned on the SMPL pose and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) used to learn a low-dimensional representation of the SMPL parameters. However, these approaches have limitations, such as allowing poses far from training examples and producing unrealistic bodies. In this paper, we propose learning an explicit prior through adversarial training to constrain the input of the SMPL model and generate realistic poses without additional constraints. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach in different applications, including optimization and regression-based frameworks. We also compare different choices of latent spaces and show that the spherical latent space brings the most benefits. Our proposed GAN-based pose prior learning technique consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art VAE-based approach.
