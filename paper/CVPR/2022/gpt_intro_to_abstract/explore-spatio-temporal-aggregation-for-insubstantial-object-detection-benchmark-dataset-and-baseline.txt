Deep learning approaches have made significant advancements in object detection. However, they still face challenges in detecting insubstantial objects captured by multispectral cameras, such as smoke, steam, and gas leaks. Given the urgent need for real-time monitoring and early warning systems for these objects due to safety concerns, there is a fresh and challenging research topic surrounding insubstantial objects. This paper discusses the differences between conventional objects and insubstantial objects and proposes four image cues to distinguish objects: Multi-scale Saliency (MS), Contrast (CC), Edge Density (ED), and Superpixels Straddling (SS). However, these cues may not be effective for the detection of insubstantial objects, as they can be more similar in appearance to the background rather than the foreground. To address this issue, the authors introduce a video-level insubstantial object detection (IOD-Video) dataset and develop a spatio-temporal aggregation framework specifically for the detection and characterization of insubstantial objects. This framework takes into account the indistinct boundaries and amorphous shapes of insubstantial objects, as well as their similarity to the background and absence of color information and saliency. By considering both spatial and temporal features, this framework aims to improve the detection and classification of insubstantial objects in videos.
