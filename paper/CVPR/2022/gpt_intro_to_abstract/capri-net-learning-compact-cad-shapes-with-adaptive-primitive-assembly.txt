Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models play a crucial role in engineering and manufacturing for decision-making and product evolution. However, existing neural models for 3D shapes face challenges in generalizing to the structural and topological variations present in CAD shapes. This paper introduces a learning framework called CAPRI-Net that aims to address these challenges by designing a neural network that learns a compact and interpretable representation for CAD models. The network is trained on the ABC dataset, which contains one million CAD models with diverse variations. CAPRI-Net leverages constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations to reconstruct CAD shapes by assembling quadric surface primitives. The network is trained using self-supervision and a combination of loss functions. To overcome the generalizability issue, the network is fine-tuned on test CAD shapes. The evaluation of CAPRI-Net demonstrates its superiority in terms of reconstruction quality, compactness, and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art learning methods. The primary application of CAPRI-Net is 3D shape reconstruction, providing a novel implicit field that leads to high-quality reconstruction of CAD models.
