In this paper, we introduce the concept of the flag median, a prototype that generalizes the geometric median to the Grassmannian using the chordal distance. We propose a novel algorithm called FlagIRLS to solve the flag median optimization problem. We compare the performance of the flag median with the ℓ2-median and the flag mean on various datasets, including synthetic datasets and well-known datasets such as MNIST handwritten digits and UCF YouTube action dataset. Our experimental results show that the FlagIRLS algorithm converges quickly and the flag median exhibits higher robustness to outliers compared to the flag mean and ℓ2-median. Additionally, the flag median achieves higher cluster purities in the LBG algorithm. This research contributes to the development of prototypes on the Grassmannian and demonstrates the potential advantages of using the flag median in various machine learning applications.
