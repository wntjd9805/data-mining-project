Image salient object detection (SOD) plays a crucial role in identifying and segmenting the most prominent object in a given scene. Existing SOD methods can be categorized as convolutional neural network (CNN) based or traditional handcrafted methods. CNN based methods have achieved remarkable success but rely heavily on large amounts of training data with pixel-wise annotations, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Handcrafted methods, on the other hand, are more flexible but are limited by manually designed image features and priors.To address these concerns, the research topic of deep unsupervised SOD has emerged. This focuses on training deep SOD networks using pseudo labels generated by traditional handcrafted SOD methods. However, directly training networks using noisy labels is not ideal as the deep network can easily fit to the corrupted labels. To overcome this, research has been done on label refinement and modeling the noise of pseudo labels. However, modeling the noisy labels and selecting reliable labels remains an open problem in unsupervised learning.In this paper, we propose a novel deep unsupervised SOD framework for effectively mining reliable pixel-wise labels from multiple pseudo labels. We introduce an Uncertainty Mining Network (UMNet) that captures soft uncertainty from multiple noisy labels using Merge-and-Split modules. This network analyzes the commonality and difference among the labels to infer the pixel-wise uncertainty map for each label. This uncertainty map is then used to train the Salient Object Detection Network (SODNet) using the reliable label samples.For network training, we address the issue of the unavailability of ground truth uncertainty under the unsupervised setting. We model the noisy labels using Gibbs distribution and develop an uncertainty weighted loss function for joint training of UMNet and SODNet. This allows the networks to effectively identify reliable pseudo labels and achieve superior performance.The contributions of this work include the development of a novel deep unsupervised SOD paradigm that learns to mine reliable labels from noisy pseudo labels, the introduction of Merge-and-Split modules for effective uncertainty mining, and the proposal of an uncertainty weighted loss function that models noisy labels in a principled way. Experimental results on SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves SOD network learning with noisy labels and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
