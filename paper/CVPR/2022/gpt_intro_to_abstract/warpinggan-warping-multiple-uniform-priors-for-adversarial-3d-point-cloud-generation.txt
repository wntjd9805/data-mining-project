3D point clouds are widely used in various applications, but obtaining realistic and complete point cloud data can be challenging and time-consuming. Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based methods have shown success in synthesizing realistic 2D images, leading to the exploration of GAN-based 3D point cloud generation. However, the unique characteristics of 3D point clouds, such as their irregular structure and unordered nature, make it difficult to extend GAN-based methods for this task. Existing approaches often generate non-uniformly distributed point clouds and suffer from limitations in capturing global shapes and local details. Furthermore, these methods can be inefficient and lack a straightforward optimization process.To address these challenges, we propose WarpingGAN, a novel GAN-based framework for 3D point cloud generation. WarpingGAN uses multiple 3D uniform priors and a function that warps these priors into different local regions of a 3D shape based on local structure-aware semantics. This approach differs from existing methods that directly learn the process of generating a fixed number of points from a latent code. Additionally, WarpingGAN incorporates a stitching loss that reduces the local differences between generated and real point clouds, improving overall quality and compactness. The uniformity of the 3D priors also promotes the generation of uniformly distributed point clouds.Our contributions include: 1. Investigating 3D point cloud generation from the perspective of unified local warping, resulting in WarpingGAN, which is lightweight, efficient, and flexible in its output. 2. Introducing a stitching loss specific to WarpingGAN, leveraging the inherent design of the discriminator to enhance the generator. 3. Conducting extensive experiments and analysis to demonstrate the superiority of WarpingGAN over state-of-the-art methods.
