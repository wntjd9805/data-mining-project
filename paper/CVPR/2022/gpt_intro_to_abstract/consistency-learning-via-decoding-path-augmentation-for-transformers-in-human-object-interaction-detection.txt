Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a visual recognition task that aims to detect interactions between individuals and objects. Previous HOI detectors have primarily relied on object detection models, extending them with an additional head for interaction classification. However, these two-stage methods come with a high computational cost. To address this, one-stage models have been proposed for faster detection, performing interaction prediction and object detection in parallel. Transformer-based architectures have also been adopted for HOI detection to introduce flexibility and improve performance. In this paper, we propose a novel method for training HOI transformers by augmenting the decoding paths with respect to possible prediction sequences. The cascaded structure of transformers allows an input query to be sequentially decoded into auxiliary sub-task outputs and the final output. We further enhance our method by enforcing cross-path consistency, which aims to predict HOI triplets regardless of inference sequences. Our training strategy can be applied to any transformer-based architecture and yields substantial improvements in two popular HOI detection benchmarks, V-COCO and HICO-DET. The proposed Cross-Path Consistency (CPC) learning strategy enhances transformers for HOI detection without increasing model capacity and inference time.
