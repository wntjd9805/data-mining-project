Automating the process of 3D content creation is a complex task that requires artistic modeling skills and technical knowledge. Photogrammetry, a technique that converts multiple photos of an object into a 3D model, has been used in game studios to create detailed virtual landscapes. However, the process of photogrammetry involves multiple stages with conflicting optimization goals and errors that can propagate between stages. This leads to a heavy reliance on manual adjustments and various software tools to achieve the desired quality of the final 3D model.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the 3D modeling process by framing it as an inverse rendering task. Our goal is to optimize as many steps as possible jointly, driven by the quality of the rendered images of the reconstructed model compared to the captured input imagery. While previous work in neural rendering has provided high-quality novel view synthesis, these methods often entangle geometry, materials, and lighting into neural networks, making scene editing operations challenging. Additionally, extracting geometry from these networks using methods like Marching Cubes can result in poor surface quality.To address these limitations, we present a highly efficient inverse rendering method capable of extracting triangular meshes with unknown topology, spatially-varying materials, and lighting from multi-view images. Our approach leverages a differentiable surface model based on a deformable tetrahedral mesh, enabling us to learn topology and vertex positions without requiring an initial guess for the 3D geometry. We extend this model to support spatially-varying materials and high dynamic range environment lighting through a novel differentiable split sum approximation. We optimize geometry, materials, and lighting jointly using a differentiable rasterizer with deferred shading.The resulting 3D model can be utilized on any device supporting triangle rendering and renders at interactive rates. Our experiments demonstrate the applicability of our method in scene editing, material decomposition, and high-quality view interpolation, all running at interactive rates in triangle-based renderers. By providing a solution that is compatible with traditional graphics engines, our approach enables artists to easily edit and extract materials, supporting efficient content creation processes in game development and other industries.
