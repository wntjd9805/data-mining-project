Deep learning methods based on neural networks have revolutionized the field of computer vision. However, these models require a large amount of labeled data for training, which can be challenging to collect in practical scenarios. Few-shot learning has emerged as a solution to this problem, aiming to learn new concepts or behaviors from a limited number of samples. Overfitting, caused by the scarcity of labeled samples, is a major challenge in few-shot learning. Various approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, including model-based methods, data augmentation techniques, and learning algorithms based on meta-learning or transfer learning strategies. Despite these efforts, the performance of few-shot learning methods is still unsatisfactory due to the limited information provided by the small set of labeled data.One approach to mitigate the data scarcity issue in few-shot learning is to utilize unlabeled data, a strategy that has been successful in semi-supervised learning. By combining semi-supervised learning with few-shot learning and mining pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples, the scarcity of labeled data can be alleviated to some extent. However, existing methods struggle to obtain completely accurate pseudo-labels, and handling the influence of false pseudo-labels on model training remains a challenge.In this paper, we propose a Clustering-based semi-supervised Few-Shot Learning (cluster-FSL) method for image classification. Our approach leverages labeled samples as factors of a cluster and represents unlabeled data on a multi-factor dictionary. We introduce Multi-Factor Clustering (MFC) to guide the acquisition of pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples, combining the distribution information of labeled and unlabeled samples to obtain more accurate pseudo-labels. In the fine-tuning stage, we use robust data augmentation and incorporate the MFC module to predict soft labels of query samples, leading to a more discriminative feature distribution. In the testing stage, we employ MFC to assign accurate pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples, effectively expanding the test support set.Experimental results demonstrate that our cluster-FSL method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as miniImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, and CUB-200-2011. We contribute to the field by proposing a novel MFC algorithm that generates more accurate clustering results by utilizing factors of labeled and unlabeled samples. Additionally, we integrate MFC into the fine-tuning and testing stages in a new way, enabling the effective expansion of support sets with high-quality pseudo labels.
