Object detection (OD) methods have made significant advancements in recent years, thanks in part to the availability of large-scale and well-annotated datasets. However, manually labeling class labels and bounding boxes for these datasets is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, semi-supervised and self-supervised OD algorithms have gained attention. This paper focuses on semi-supervised objection detection (SSOD) methods and introduces a novel DenSe Learning (DSL) algorithm for anchor-free SSOD. The current state-of-the-art SSOD methods are pseudo-label based approaches, primarily based on a two-stage anchor-based detector like Faster-RCNN. However, anchor-free one-stage detectors, such as FCOS, are more practical and efficient for real-world applications. The learning of anchor-free based detectors requires careful guidance, especially in the SSOD settings, but there is limited research on anchor-free SSOD methods.To address these challenges, the proposed DSL algorithm utilizes an Adaptive Filtering (AF) strategy to partition pseudo-labels into fine-grained parts and refines them using a MetaNet to remove false positives. An Aggregated Teacher (AT) is introduced to enhance the stability and quality of the estimated pseudo-labels. Additionally, learning from shuffled image patches and uncertainty-consistency regularization is employed to improve model generalization.The contributions of this paper include the development of an anchor-free DSL method for SSOD, the proposal of an AF strategy for assigning fine-grained pseudo-labels, the introduction of an AT to improve pseudo-label quality, and the use of shuffled patches and uncertainty-consistency regularization for improved generalization.Experiments conducted on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate that the proposed DSL method achieves significant performance improvements over existing SSOD methods.
