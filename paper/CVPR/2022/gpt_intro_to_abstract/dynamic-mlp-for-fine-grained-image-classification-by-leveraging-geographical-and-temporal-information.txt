Fine-grained image classification is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to distinguish fine categories of objects or species. Traditional image classification methods struggle to differentiate visually similar species with almost identical appearances. In addition to existing approaches that focus on discriminative regions of images, multi-branch learning, and data augmentations, incorporating additional information such as geographical and temporal data has shown promise in improving fine-grained classification. Images often contain metadata such as geographic location and time, which can be leveraged to aid in classification. This paper proposes a dynamic Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) framework that dynamically maps similar image features to different positions in the feature space to achieve accurate classification. The dynamic MLP incorporates adaptive weights generated from multimodal features extracted from the additional information, enhancing the representation ability of the image features. Extensive experiments conducted on several fine-grained classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the dynamic MLP framework for multimodal fine-grained image classification and the achievement of state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets. An ensemble of dynamic MLP further demonstrates the competitiveness of the proposed method by achieving high accuracy on the iNaturalist 2021 dataset.
