Image denoising is an important area of research in computer vision, aiming to remove noise from images and restore a clean version. Traditional algorithms have been surpassed by recent convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods, which achieve better performance. However, these methods are usually trained on synthetic datasets with additive white Gaussian noise, which limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To address this, some approaches have attempted to acquire realistic noisy-clean image pairs, but this process is challenging and often not feasible. To overcome these limitations, novel un-/self-supervised frameworks have been proposed. These frameworks utilize unsupervised adversarial training or multiple noisy images taken from the same scene to train denoising models. Alternatively, some methods train on single noisy images by synthesizing two independent noisy versions. However, these methods assume specific noise distributions or configurations that may not hold in practice. This paper presents a self-supervised denoising method, CVF-SID, for real-world sRGB images. CVF-SID utilizes a novel cyclic multivariate function (CVF) to disentangle the input into clean image, signal-dependent, and signal-independent noises. Various self-supervised training objectives and data augmentation strategies are proposed to improve performance. Experimental results show that CVF-SID outperforms other un-/self-supervised methods on real-world images and achieves comparable results. Overall, this work introduces a novel approach for image denoising that addresses the limitations of current methods and demonstrates superior performance.
