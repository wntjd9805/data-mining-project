The introduction of the computer science paper discusses the importance of developing safe and risk-aware autonomous systems that can interact with humans. The complexity of human motion poses a challenge in capturing it in a computational model due to the multitude of continuous movement possibilities. Traditional systems rely on constraints to ensure safety, while single-motion-output methods limit the potential of high-level features. In contrast, Monte-Carlo method models prioritize generative diversity over representing actual plausible motions. This paper aims to develop a human motion prediction model that accurately represents the multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion while considering physical boundaries and real-world robotic use cases. The authors propose Motron, a model that incorporates the structure of the human skeleton and utilizes a probabilistic output structure based on the Concentrated Gaussian distribution. Motron aims to provide a maximum amount of information for downstream robotic modules. The authors evaluate the model's performance using both single-output and sample-based metrics and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. Additionally, Motron is shown to handle occluded data present in real-world applications by incorporating additional uncertainty in its output.
