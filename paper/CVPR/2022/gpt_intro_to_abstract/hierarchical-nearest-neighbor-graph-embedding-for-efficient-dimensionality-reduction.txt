Dimensionality reduction techniques have become increasingly important in various scientific fields due to the growing size of real-world datasets. These techniques play a crucial role in visualizing and processing high dimensional data. Current research focuses on developing scalable unsupervised algorithms that can preserve the structure of data in lower dimensions while handling massive datasets. Two main directions are identified: preserving the global distances among all samples in the data and preserving the local structure of the data. Prior methods such as PCA, MDS, and Sammon mapping focus on preserving global distances, while more recent methods like t-SNE, LargeVis, and UMAP aim to preserve local structure as well. Achieving this requires solving complex optimization problems, making these algorithms computationally expensive and limiting their runtime performance on large datasets.This paper presents a different approach that captures the multi-stage nearest neighbor (NN) properties of the data and projects points in a simple algorithmic way. The approach leverages Nearest Neighbor Graphs (NNGs), which have been extensively studied. By embedding the individual components of the NNG separately, the connected components of NNGs can capture clusters of samples. Building 1-NNGs recursively on these connected components provides a hierarchical view of how samples merge together at successive levels. This hierarchical node graph offers insights into the distribution of local neighborhoods in the high dimensional space.The proposed method, termed h-NNE (Hierarchical 1-Nearest Neighbor graph based Embedding), uses an inexpensive preliminary projection of the high dimensional data onto a desired lower dimensional space. The original hierarchical node graph in the target space is then utilized to enforce the local structure directly. This is achieved through a fast recursive top-down approach that moves clusters of samples towards the nodes in the hierarchical node graph. The method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both embedding quality and runtime efficiency.One of the main contributions of this work is the introduction of an alternative dimensionality reduction and visualization method that does not rely on expensive optimization methods. This allows the proposed method to operate significantly faster and without requiring hyperparameter tuning while maintaining comparable performance. The following sections will discuss related works, present the proposed method in detail, and provide experimental results and comparisons with existing methods on diverse datasets.
