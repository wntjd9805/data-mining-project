This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised learning framework called SimMatch. The framework aims to address the challenge of learning with few labeled data by simultaneously considering semantic similarity and instance similarity. Unlike previous works that use weakly augmented views as pseudo-labels, SimMatch proposes to leverage a labeled memory buffer to generate more reliable matching targets. This allows the semantic and instance pseudo-labels to interact and be mutually propagated. The effectiveness of SimMatch is demonstrated through extensive experiments, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised learning. For example, with only 400 epochs of training, SimMatch achieves 67.2% and 74.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 1% and 10% labeled examples respectively. This research contributes by proposing a framework that combines both semantic and instance similarity in semi-supervised learning, and by introducing a labeled memory buffer for improving the reliability of pseudo-labels.
