The field of image-based crowd counting has seen significant progress since the introduction of density map based methods. The combination of deep learning and density map learning, particularly with the use of the Multi-Column Neural Network (MCNN), has led to state-of-the-art performance in crowd counting. One notable approach, the Bayesian Loss (BL), distinguishes itself by changing only the loss function in the pipeline. Instead of generating a discrete density map, the BL uses the ground truth dot map to calculate class conditional distributions (CCD) for each position. This method highlights the importance of utilizing ground truth information for proper supervision.Recent research works have focused on how to fully exploit the ground truth's information for high-quality supervisory information. Two approaches, Distribution Matching (DMCount) and the Generalized Loss (GL), utilize the optimal transport (OT) distance as the loss function between predicted density maps and ground truth dot maps. The OT loss considers the influence of all nearby pixels in the ground truth, allowing for better exploitation of position information.Another approach, the Purely Point-Based Framework (P2PNet), directly trains the network to predict people's head positions in the ground truth. This method uses the exact position information in the ground truth by calculating one vs. one matches between predictions and ground truth.However, these state-of-the-art methods have their limitations. Both the OT loss and P2PNet require inefficient external algorithms to extract spatial information from the ground truth in each training step. This makes the training process less efficient. Additionally, while position information is utilized in OT/P2PNet, counting information is not fully conveyed to the deep neural network.To address these issues, this paper introduces a new approach that extends the definition of the characteristic function from probability distributions to finite measures. By using the characteristic function, the paper proposes a simple and efficient loss function that does not require external algorithms for extracting spatial information. The proposed loss function minimizes the upper bound of a pseudo sup norm metric between the predicted and the ground truth density map and shows competitive performance on five benchmark datasets.
