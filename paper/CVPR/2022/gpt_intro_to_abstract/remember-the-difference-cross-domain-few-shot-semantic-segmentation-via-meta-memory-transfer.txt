Semantic segmentation has achieved significant progress in recent years with the help of large annotated datasets and deep convolutional neural networks. However, the process of obtaining these datasets is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and the trained models often fail to segment novel unseen categories. To address this problem, few-shot semantic segmentation methods have emerged, aiming to produce accurate pixel-level predictions for novel categories with only a few training images. Existing few-shot semantic segmentation methods assume that the base training set comes from the same domain as the testing set. However, collecting sufficient examples in specific areas, such as dermatology or satellite imagery, is often infeasible. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a new problem called cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation, where a satisfactory few-shot segmentation network is trained on a different domain and then transferred to the target domain.While there have been some cross-domain few-shot methods developed for image classification, applying them directly to pixel-level segmentation is challenging due to the fundamental differences between the two tasks. Domain adaptation or few-shot domain adaptation semantic segmentation methods can also address the domain shift issue but are not suitable for the disjoint categories between the source and target domains in our setting.The challenges in cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation involve the domain shift problem between training and testing tasks and the scarcity of labeled data for new categories. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework called CDFSS, which focuses on reducing the domain gap through domain generalization and exploring discriminative information from few-shot novel categories. The framework utilizes a meta-memory to collect domain-specific information from the source domain and enhances the model's generalization by loading the stored memory into both the source and target domains. In the target domain, the model utilizes the source meta-knowledge to guide feature enhancement and alleviate the domain gap. Memory-enhanced features help generate diverse prototypes for novel categories, resulting in robust predictions.The contributions of this paper include proposing a novel framework for cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation, introducing a plug-and-play meta-knowledge module for transferring prior source distribution, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework on four different cross-domain scenarios. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance under the cross-domain setting, expanding the use scenarios of few-shot segmentation tasks.
