This paper addresses the problem of recovering superquadrics from noisy point clouds, focusing specifically on the single superquadric recovery problem. Superquadrics are geometric primitives with a rich shape vocabulary, allowing for more detailed object descriptions compared to traditional volumetric primitives like cuboids. Existing methods for superquadric recovery are vulnerable to noise and outliers and are sensitive to initialization. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a probabilistic method for superquadric recovery. They formulate the problem as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem and introduce the Expectation, Maximization and Switch (EMS) algorithm to avoid local optima. The authors use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to update the parameters of the superquadric and infer the probability of a point being an outlier. To further improve the accuracy of the shape approximation, the authors introduce the S-step, which involves globally searching for candidate parameters that encode similar superquadrics in terms of shape and pose. This strategy is made possible by investigating the geometric symmetry and algebraic ambiguity of superquadrics. The authors also show that their probabilistic formulation can be extended to multi-superquadrics recovery tasks. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the robustness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed algorithm in abstracting optimal superquadric primitives from noisy point clouds. Additionally, the algorithm is capable of identifying major parts of complex point clouds that can be approximated by a superquadric. Overall, the paper proposes a novel probabilistic method for recovering superquadrics from point clouds, addressing the limitations of existing methods and achieving more accurate shape approximations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in various scenarios, making it a promising approach for object modeling and understanding 3D environments.
