Lane detection is a key technology in autonomous driving, and camera sensors are commonly used for this task. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved lane detection performance, as shown in the 2017 TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge. However, the conventional evaluation metrics used for lane detection may not accurately reflect its performance in real-world applications, particularly in challenging scenarios such as adversarial attacks. This study introduces two new driving-oriented metrics, E2E-LD and PSLD, to measure the performance of lane detection models in autonomous driving, specifically in automated lane centering. These metrics are designed to address the limitations of conventional metrics and to evaluate the robustness of lane detection models in real-world scenarios. A large-scale empirical study is conducted using four major types of lane detection approaches on the TuSimple dataset and a newly constructed dataset, Comma2k19-LD. Physical-world adversarial attacks are used to simulate realistic challenging scenarios. The study finds that the conventional metrics have limited correlation with the driving-oriented metrics, indicating that recent improvements based on conventional metrics may not lead to meaningful improvements in autonomous driving. On the other hand, the newly-designed metrics, particularly PSLD, show strong positive correlations with the driving-oriented metrics. The study highlights the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics and underscores the need for more downstream task-aware evaluation in lane detection. The contributions of this study include the design of the driving-oriented metrics, the methodology for generating physical-world adversarial attacks, the creation of the Comma2k19-LD dataset, and the empirical evaluation of lane detection models in the context of autonomous driving. The codes and datasets used in this study are available on the project websites.
