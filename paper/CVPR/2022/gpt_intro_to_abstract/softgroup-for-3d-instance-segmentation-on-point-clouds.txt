Scene understanding on 3D data has gained significant attention due to advancements in 3D sensors and the availability of large-scale 3D datasets. Instance segmentation on point clouds plays a crucial role in various applications, such as autonomous driving, virtual reality, and robot navigation. Existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D instance segmentation follow a bottom-up pipeline, where point-wise semantic labels and center offset vectors are learned, and points of the same label are grouped into instances based on their geometric distances. However, these methods rely on hard semantic predictions, which can lead to low overlap between predicted instances and ground truth, as well as extra false-positive instances from incorrectly labeled regions. To address these issues, this paper proposes SoftGroup, a novel approach that performs instance grouping using soft semantic scores instead of hard one-hot semantic predictions. SoftGroup leverages a score threshold to determine the class of an object, considering the intuition that object parts with incorrect semantic predictions may still have reasonable scores for the true semantic class. By grouping based on soft semantic scores, SoftGroup achieves more accurate instance segmentation on the true semantic class and suppresses instances with incorrect semantic predictions by learning to classify them as background. Additionally, a top-down refinement stage is introduced to further improve the positive samples and suppress false positives introduced by wrong semantic predictions.Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including ScanNet v2 and S3DIS, demonstrate the effectiveness of SoftGroup. It outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by a significant margin in terms of average precision (AP50) on the hidden test set of ScanNet (+6.2%) and Area 5 of S3DIS (+6.8%). Furthermore, SoftGroup exhibits fast processing speeds, requiring only 345ms to process a ScanNet scene. In summary, this paper introduces SoftGroup as an improved approach for 3D instance segmentation, offering three key contributions: (1) grouping on soft semantic scores to avoid error propagation, (2) a top-down refinement stage to enhance positive samples and suppress false positives, and (3) extensive experiments showcasing significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets with different evaluation metrics.
