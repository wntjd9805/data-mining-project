This paper addresses the problem of 6D object pose estimation in uncalibrated settings, where the camera's intrinsic parameters are unknown. The objective is to retrieve a 3D model of an object from a library and estimate the relative camera-object pose and focal length from a single input image. This problem has applications in augmented reality and computer graphics. Previous approaches rely on local correspondences or render-and-compare methods but fail in scenes with texture-less areas or assume a controlled environment. This paper introduces FocalPose, a novel render-and-compare approach that handles uncalibrated settings. The method extends a state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation method by integrating focal length update rules and investigating different loss functions. The results show that FocalPose outperforms the state of the art in estimating focal length and 6D pose, and it is applied to a large collection of 3D meshes.
