This paper introduces the field of Visual Geo-localization (VG) or Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which involves estimating the location where a photo was taken based on a database of images of known locations. Despite the rapid growth of research in this field, there are two major limitations: a focus on single metric optimization and a lack of a standardized framework for training and testing VG models. The paper proposes a new open-source benchmark that addresses these issues, providing researchers with a tool to build, train, and test various VG architectures and examine the impact of different components on the results. The benchmark also offers insights into factors such as number of parameters, FLOPs, and descriptors dimensionality. The authors run experiments using the benchmark to determine suitable components for real-world applications, deriving good practices based on the dataset and hardware availability. The results showcase the effectiveness of certain components, such as ResNet-50 and Visual Transformers, and provide insights into techniques like partial negative mining and reduced resolution. The benchmark's software and models are available for use at a provided link.
