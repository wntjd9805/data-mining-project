The success of deep learning in medical image analysis tasks relies heavily on the availability of labeled datasets. However, labeling these datasets is challenging and expensive, as it requires well-trained radiologists. To address this problem, researchers have proposed various approaches, such as utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data in a semi-supervised manner or incrementally selecting instances for annotation. Additionally, some researchers have explored self-training and self-supervised learning methods to maximize the potential of limited labeled data. In this paper, we investigate the impact of template choice on the performance of landmark detection models. We observe a significant variation in performance depending on the chosen template, highlighting the need for an effective selection strategy. We propose a framework called Sample Choosing Policy (SCP) to find the most annotation-worthy images as templates. To tackle the absence of landmark labels, we use handcrafted key points as substitutes. To replace the mean radial error (MRE), we introduce a similarity score based on the features of potential key points. We also employ pixel-wise self-supervised learning to train a feature extractor for landmark detection. Our experiments show that SCP significantly improves the MRE performance of one-shot medical landmark detection compared to random template selection. In the Cephalometric X-ray dataset, the MRE is reduced from 3.595mm to 3.083mm, and in the Hand X-ray dataset, it is reduced from 4.114mm to 2.635mm. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in selecting high-quality templates for deep model training under limited supervision.
