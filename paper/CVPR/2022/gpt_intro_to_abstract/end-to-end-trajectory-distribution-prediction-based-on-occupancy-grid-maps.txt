Trajectory prediction is of critical importance in various applications such as robot navigation and self-driving cars. To address the inherent multimodal uncertainty in trajectory prediction, numerous works have proposed learning multi-modal distributions of future trajectories. However, most of these approaches focus on diversity rather than precision, which can lead to assigning probabilities to unrealistic predictions. In this paper, we propose a solution that minimizes the symmetric cross-entropy between the predictive distribution and the ground-truth distribution. To achieve this, we utilize an occupancy grid map (OGM) to approximate the trajectory probability. Unlike previous methods that represent all future position distributions with a single OGM, we predict an OGM for each future position using a convolutional long short-term memory network. Additionally, we develop an end-to-end interpretable model that incorporates a CVAE model with a coarse future trajectory plan to backpropagate the symmetric cross-entropy loss. Moreover, we introduce a Transformer-based refinement network to obtain a small set of representative trajectories from the over-sampled outcomes of our prediction model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both trajectory diversity and quality, as demonstrated on the Stanford Drone Dataset and Intersection Drone Dataset. Overall, this paper makes contributions in VIN-based IRL, trajectory distribution learning using OGMs, and trajectory sampling using a Transformer-based refinement network.
