Human motion prediction plays a crucial role in various applications, including human-robot interaction, autonomous driving, VR/AR applications, and performance capture. However, the lack of training motion data often leads to low prediction accuracy. Acquiring sufficient motion data is challenging and costly, hindering the development of these applications. Data Augmentation (DA) has been used to alleviate the data insufficiency problem, but it is more challenging for motion data than for image data, as simple numerical transformations may result in physically implausible motions. In this paper, we propose a novel motion data augmentation approach that includes motion synthesis and motion correction. Our motion synthesis utilizes Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Inverse Kinematics (IK) to exploit the training data distribution and human knowledge, respectively. While most of the synthesized motions are physically plausible, some unrealistic artifacts are observed, leading to low prediction accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a motion correction method that combines imitation learning with physics simulation and subsequent motion debiasing. The imitation learning rectifies the artifacts, and the motion debiasing offsets biases introduced during the imitation learning process.Our contributions in terms of motion diversity and physical plausibility are as follows: 1. VAE-based human-motion synthesis: Our generative model, combined with adversarial training, can generate plausible motions even with insufficient motion data.2. IK-based human-motion synthesis: Our method requires less effort compared to the standard IK approach, as it only requires defining a target sampling space for a keyframe.3. PD-residual force: We propose the PD-residual force, which accelerates the training process of imitation learning in a physics simulator, effectively addressing the physical implausibility of synthesized motions.4. Motion debiasing: Our motion debiasing successfully offsets the motion bias introduced by imitation learning, maximizing the effectiveness of our data augmentation process.This paper presents an overview of our proposed motion data augmentation approach, highlighting the synthesis and correction processes. Finally, our motion debiasing technique ensures that the augmented data is physically plausible, effectively overcoming the challenges of learning from a limited number of training motions.
