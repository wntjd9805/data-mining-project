Machine learning has become a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale datasets in various behavior analysis domains. However, obtaining labeled data for training models can be challenging and costly, particularly when domain expertise is required for annotation. To reduce annotation costs, weak supervision techniques have been proposed, which utilize noisy, task-level labeling functions to weakly label data. In this paper, we introduce AutoSWAP, a framework for automatically synthesizing diverse sets of task-level labeling functions using a small labeled dataset and domain knowledge encoded in domain-level labeling functions. Our approach addresses the limitations of manual weak supervision, such as the inability to use general domain knowledge and the need for handcrafted labeling functions for new tasks. We propose a novel program synthesis formulation that leverages a domain-specific language and domain-level labeling functions to automatically generate task-level labeling functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in behavior analysis domains, including mouse, fly, and basketball player behaviors. Our evaluation shows that AutoSWAP is capable of significantly improving data efficiency and reducing expert effort compared to existing automatic weak supervision methods. The implementation of AutoSWAP is publicly available for further exploration.
