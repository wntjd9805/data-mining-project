Monocular hand-object contact recovery plays a crucial role in enabling accurate interactions in metaverse and telepresence robot control. Traditional methods rely on optimization strategies that judge contact regions based on the closest distances between hand and object surfaces. However, the accuracy of hand-object pose estimation is challenging to guarantee with monocular reconstruction. Recent approaches have been proposed that learn hand-object contact priors from well-labeled datasets, but their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the contact data.In this paper, we propose a stability-driven contact reconstruction method to ensure reliable hand-object interactions. Our key idea is to reconstruct the contact pattern driven by the physical criteria of force and torque balancing, calculated by a physics engine. Most existing methods utilize relative object displacements to evaluate contact stability, but these criteria have limitations in both hand modeling and stability evaluation.To address these limitations, we adopt a structured multi-body approach for dynamics simulation, using a series of ellipsoidal primitives to represent the hand and object. Our front-end network estimates the state parameters for composing these primitives, enabling personalized adjustments based on image-based information. Compared to traditional hand modeling, this approach facilitates robot control and force analysis. We propose novel stability criteria that consider physical factors related to contact, and we utilize sampling-based optimization methods to ensure the estimated state meets these stability requirements. To analyze the sim-to-real gap in our simulation, we build a hand-object contact dataset that includes physical properties and stability evaluations for each interaction scene.Our contributions include a regression-optimization framework for reconstructing hand-object contacts and capturing physical correlations from monocular images guided by stability. We also present a hand-object representation and learning strategy based on ellipsoid primitives, which enhances the convenience of deep learning inference and physical simulation. Moreover, we provide a hand-object interaction dataset with physical attributes and stability metrics, validating the sim-to-real consistency of related methods.The dataset and codes for our proposed approach will be made publicly available for further research and development.
