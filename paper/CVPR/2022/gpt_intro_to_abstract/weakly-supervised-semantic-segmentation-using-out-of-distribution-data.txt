Pixel-wise labeling is a labor-intensive task in semantic segmentation. Researchers have explored various forms of weak supervision for semantic segmentation, such as using scribbles, points, boxes, and class labels. This paper focuses on weakly supervised semantic segmentation with class labels. Existing methods in this category typically follow a two-stage process, where they generate pixel-level pseudo-targets using class classifiers, and then train the segmentation network using these pseudo-targets. However, the pseudo-targets generated only from class labels often suffer from confusion between foreground and background cues, leading to inaccurate segmentation results. To address this problem, researchers have sought additional sources of guidance. This paper introduces a new source of guidance, the out-of-distribution (OoD) data, which consists of images that do not contain any of the foreground classes of interest. The authors propose using hard OoD images as negative samples, which helps to distinguish confusing cues and improve the segmentation performance. Obtaining OoD images does not require significant additional annotation efforts, as they can be collected from the remaining pool of candidate images that are not selected for foreground classes. The authors also propose a method called W-OoD, which utilizes hard OoD samples and incorporates a metric-learning objective to improve the representation of background cues in the feature space. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark for weakly supervised semantic segmentation. This paper contributes a new paradigm for utilizing OoD samples in weakly supervised semantic segmentation, a dataset of hard OoDs for 20 Pascal categories, and the W-OoD method for improved segmentation performance.
