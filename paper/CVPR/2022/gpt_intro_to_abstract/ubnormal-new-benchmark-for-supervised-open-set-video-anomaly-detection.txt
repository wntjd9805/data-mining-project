Video anomaly detection is a challenging task in computer science, despite significant advancements and impressive performance levels. The difficulty of the task arises from two main aspects: the reliance on the context of anomalies and the lack of abnormal training data. The reliance on context makes the task nearly impossible to gather abnormal training data, as it is not ethical to cause harm or distress to obtain video examples. In the literature, two distinct formulations have been identified to address this difficulty. The mainstream formulation treats anomaly detection as a one-class classification task, where training videos only contain normal events, and unfamiliar events are labeled as abnormal. However, this formulation usually leads to lower performance rates due to the lack of knowledge of abnormal examples. The alternative formulation treats anomaly detection as a weakly-supervised action recognition task, where training videos contain both normal and abnormal events but annotations are provided at the video level. This formulation fails to evaluate the system's capability to detect unseen anomaly types. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel formulation that frames video anomaly detection as a supervised open-set classification problem. In this formulation, both normal and abnormal events are available at training time, but the anomalies that occur at inference time belong to a distinct set of anomaly types. This approach enables the use of fully-supervised models, enhances performance, and allows for the evaluation of systems' capability to detect unseen anomalies. The paper introduces a new dataset, UBnormal, consisting of 29 virtual scenes with 236,902 video frames, and shows that abnormal training videos are helpful for abnormal event detection using state-of-the-art models. The paper also conducts a data-centric study, demonstrating performance gains in a recent state-of-the-art method on two natural scene datasets. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of video anomaly detection by proposing a supervised open-set classification formulation and providing evidence of its effectiveness through experiments and analysis.
