Image attribute editing is a task that involves modifying specific attributes of an image while preserving other details. The use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has allowed for more advanced image manipulation, particularly with the Style-GAN model. However, existing GAN inversion techniques have limitations in terms of reconstruction accuracy and editing quality. Optimization approaches may achieve high reconstruction accuracy but often result in inferior editing quality, while encoder-based methods may show better editing performance but produce inaccurate and low-fidelity reconstructions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Rate-Distortion-Edit trade-off for GAN inversion, which introduces a novel framework that combines low-rate encoder models with distortion consultation to improve reconstruction quality and editability. The consultation branch serves as a reference for generation and conveys image-specific information that is often ignored in reconstruction. The distortion map between the source and low-fidelity reconstructed image is used to project the image-specific details to higher-rate latent maps. This framework shows improved reconstruction quality without the need for test-time optimization. Additionally, an adaptive distortion alignment (ADA) network is designed to adjust the distortion map with edited images, allowing for more accurate editing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of details preservation, making it suitable for various image domains and videos. The framework is simple, fast, and can be easily applied to GAN models.
