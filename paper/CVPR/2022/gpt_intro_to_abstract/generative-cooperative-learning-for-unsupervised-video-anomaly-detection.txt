Learning-based anomaly detection tasks in the real world are challenging due to the rarity and unconstrained nature of such events. Obtaining sufficient anomaly examples for training fully-supervised models is difficult and often impractical. To address this, one popular approach is to train a one-class classifier using only normal training examples. However, this approach has limitations, such as limited availability of normal training data and unsuitability for complex problems with diverse multiple classes and dynamic situations. Weakly supervised anomaly detection methods, which use video-level labels, have gained popularity but still require manual inspection of full videos. There is a lack of notable attempts to leverage unlabelled training data for video anomaly detection. In this work, we propose an unsupervised mode for video anomaly detection, which is more challenging but also more rewarding. We introduce the Generative Cooperative Learning (GCL) method, which takes unlabelled videos as input and predicts frame-level anomaly scores. GCL consists of a generator and a discriminator trained in a cooperative manner to improve anomaly detection performance. The generator reconstructs normal representations and distorts anomalous representations using negative learning. The discriminator estimates the probability of an instance being anomalous. Pseudo-labels are generated from the generator and used to train the discriminator, and then pseudo-labels from the trained discriminator are used to improve the generator. Our proposed method is capable of localizing anomalous events in complex surveillance scenarios without requiring labelled training data. It is the first attempt to tackle surveillance video anomaly detection in a fully unsupervised mode. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets show that our method outperforms baselines and existing unsupervised and one-class classification methods.
