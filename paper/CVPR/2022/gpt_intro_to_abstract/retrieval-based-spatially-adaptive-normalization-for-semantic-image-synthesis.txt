Semantic image synthesis is a crucial problem in computer vision that aims to generate photo-realistic images from semantic maps. This task has various applications in fields such as virtual idol, special effects, robotics, and image manipulation. Previous research in reference-based image synthesis has focused on retrieving, editing, and stitching references from external memories. However, these methods often rely on hand-crafted and sub-optimal approaches. Recent studies have utilized deep generative networks with spatially-adaptive normalization architectures to improve semantic image synthesis. However, these methods still produce blurry results due to their uniform modulation of activations within semantic objects. In this paper, we propose a novel feature normalization method called Retrieval-based Spatially Adaptive Normalization (RESAIL). Our method leverages the object segment mask from the input semantic map and retrieves segment images with similar shapes from a training dataset. These retrieved segment images are then composited to provide spatially variant guidance at the pixel level. We introduce a retrieval-based spatially adaptive normalization technique that combines the retrieval-based guidance with the semantic map to modulate feature activations. Our method effectively generates visually plausible images with clear details. Unlike previous approaches, RESAIL utilizes retrieval-based guidance for improved spatially adaptive normalization, leading to more photo-realistic synthesis results. To overcome the challenge of perceptual supervision during training, we introduce a data distortion mechanism on ground-truth images to mimic the quality of retrieval-based guidance. This allows us to use the distorted ground-truth images as alternatives to retrieval-based guidance, enabling the utilization of perceptual supervision for model training. Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in synthesizing photo-realistic images from semantic maps. Overall, our contributions include the introduction of the RESAIL model for semantic image synthesis, the use of a data distortion mechanism for enhanced model training and visual quality, and the extensive evaluation of our method against state-of-the-art approaches.
