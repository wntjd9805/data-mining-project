This paper introduces the concept of Locality Injection, a methodology that provides a Fully-Connected (FC) layer with the local bias necessary for effective visual understanding. By combining FC layers with parallel convolutional layers and incorporating batch normalization, the paper proposes a RepMLP Block as a building block for Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Furthermore, a hierarchical architecture composed of RepMLP Blocks is proposed to enhance visual understanding. The paper addresses the challenge of parameter coupling in hierarchical MLP architectures by implementing a set-sharing linear mapping technique. The proposed RepMLPNet achieves a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off with only 100 training epochs on ImageNet. The implementation of Locality Injection not only improves the performance of RepMLPNet but also ResMLP models. Additionally, RepMLPNet demonstrates satisfactory performance as a backbone for semantic segmentation, offering multi-scale feature maps with different levels of semantic information. Overall, the combination of Locality Injection, RepMLP Blocks, and a hierarchical architecture contributes to the development of an MLP model that is friendly to small datasets, trainable with ordinary methods, and effective in visual recognition.
