Text segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, but current methods primarily focus on segmenting objects rather than text. To address this gap, we propose a new text segmentation dataset called Bi-lingual Text Segmentation (BTS) that includes a wide range of scenes, diverse images, and various character types. BTS contains annotations for text regions, transcripts, and masks, enabling not only text segmentation but also text detection, recognition, and end-to-end text spotting tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of BTS by comparing it to a synthetic dataset and analyzing the performance of different methods trained on both datasets. To improve the performance of bi-lingual text segmentation, we introduce a novel approach called the Prior Guided Text Segmentation Network (PGTSNet), which leverages a recognition model to provide guidance for capturing the global structure of characters. Our approach achieves four main contributions: 1. The creation of BTS, the first large-scale bi-lingual text segmentation dataset that includes Chinese characters in addition to English words and digits. BTS proves to be superior through comprehensive evaluations and comparisons with synthetic datasets.2. The development of a module that highlights the text region and serves as a prior to enhance text segmentation performance in different scenes.3. The incorporation of a plug-in text recognition module as a prior to provide supervision for more stable and accurate text segmentation, particularly for large-sized text.4. The adoption of total variation loss in the text segmentation task, which effectively suppresses ambient noises and promotes the production of smooth masks.Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and approach, suggesting significant improvements in bi-lingual text segmentation.
