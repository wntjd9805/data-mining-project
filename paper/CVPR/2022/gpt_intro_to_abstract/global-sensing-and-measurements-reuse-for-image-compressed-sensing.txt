Compressed Sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that efficiently acquires and reconstructs signals. It has gained significant attention from researchers due to its potential in solving the ill-posed problem of recovering high-dimensional sparse signals. In the field of image CS, the core challenges lie in designing an effective sensing matrix and developing efficient algorithms for signal reconstruction. Traditional methods have limitations in capturing statistical correlation between signal elements and require high computational overhead. In recent years, deep learning has shown promising results in various computer vision tasks, motivating researchers to explore its potential in addressing the challenges of CS. However, existing deep learning-based CS methods often overlook spatial features in images, leading to limited reconstruction quality and ignoring the hierarchical nature of features in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the use of Global Sensing Module (GSM) and Measurements Reuse Block (MRB) in an end-to-end network called MR-CCSNet. GSM aims to capture hierarchical features by using a shortcut connection and 1Ã—1 convolutions to sample from multiple layers, while MRB enables the effective extraction of matching information from measurements. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MR-CCSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality, particularly at low sampling ratios. The effectiveness of GSM and MRB is further validated through ablation studies. In summary, this study contributes to the field of CS by proposing innovative solutions for efficient sampling and effective utilization of measurements, resulting in improved image reconstruction quality.
