Person re-identification (ReID) is a task in computer vision that aims to identify a specific person across multiple cameras. With the increasing demand for intelligent video surveillance, ReID has become an important topic. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in ReID, learning discriminative features to identify individuals is still challenging due to various factors such as pose variations, occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Most existing works in ReID focus on network design and often overlook the importance of the loss function. This paper explores the space of generalized margin-based softmax (GMS) loss functions to find a better loss function for person re-identification than the currently used cross-entropy and triplet losses. The authors propose a novel method called AutoLoss-GMS that automatically searches for the GMS loss function using an evolutionary algorithm. The method takes advantage of computational graphs and introduces mutation operations to improve the diversity of the offspring. Additionally, the authors introduce a loss-rejection protocol, equivalence-check strategy, and predictor-based promising-loss chooser to enhance search efficiency. The proposed method is the first to use a predictor in loss function search and achieves state-of-the-art performance in person re-identification.
