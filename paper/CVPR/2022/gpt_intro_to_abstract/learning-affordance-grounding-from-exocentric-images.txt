Affordance grounding aims to understand the "action possibilities" of objects by perceiving and reasoning about their potential interactions. This ability is crucial for intelligent agents that actively interact with and perceive their environment. Affordance grounding has numerous applications, including robot grasping, scene understanding, and action prediction. However, understanding affordances is challenging due to the dynamic nature of this property and the complex relationship between humans and their environment. Humans can easily perceive the affordance region of an object by observing human-object interactions and establishing an egocentric definition. This paper proposes a task of affordance grounding from an exocentric view, where affordance knowledge is learned from exocentric human-object interactions and transferred to object images using affordance labels as supervision. In the testing stage, the model predicts the affordance region for a specific object based on an egocentric object image and a particular affordance label.To address this problem, the paper presents a cross-view knowledge transfer framework. This framework includes an Affordance Invariance Mining (AIM) module that decomposes human-object interactions into affordance representations determined by object properties and individual habits. A low rank matrix decomposition is utilized to obtain affordance-specific cues while minimizing intra-class differences caused by diverse interactions. Additionally, the paper introduces an Affordance Co-relation Preserving (ACP) strategy to establish links between different affordances and reduce uncertainty caused by multiple affordance regions on an object.To enable comprehensive research, the paper proposes a new dataset named AGD20K, consisting of exocentric and egocentric images from multiple affordance categories. Experimental results on the AGD20K dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing object properties and suppressing the diversity of affordance interactions. In summary, the contributions of this paper include the introduction of the affordance grounding from an exocentric view task, the establishment of the AGD20K benchmark dataset, and the development of a cross-view knowledge transfer framework. Experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method and provide a strong baseline for future research in affordance grounding.
