This paper introduces a transformer-based architecture for scene text detection. Traditional methods for scene text detection rely on complex processing steps and struggle with challenges such as varying scales and complex shapes. Inspired by the success of transformers in natural language processing and object detection, this paper proposes a simple yet effective approach that samples and groups relevant features using a transformer. The proposed method eliminates redundant background information, improves grouping accuracy, and achieves end-to-end detection. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.
