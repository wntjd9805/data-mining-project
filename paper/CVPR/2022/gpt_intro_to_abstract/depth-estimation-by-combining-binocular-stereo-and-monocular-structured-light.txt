This paper focuses on the problem of depth estimation in computer vision and its applications in various fields such as 3D modeling, robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. The methods for depth estimation can be categorized into active structured-light, binocular stereo vision, time-of-flight, and monocular depth estimation. The authors highlight the limitations of existing depth sensors, such as the Kinect and iPhone X, and propose a novel stereo vision system that combines the advantages of monocular structured-light and binocular stereo vision. The system consists of an RGB camera, an IR camera, and an IR speckle projector. The authors also introduce a new stereo dataset, MonoBinoStereo, to evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed method. They demonstrate the accuracy of their system and highlight its robustness to weak and rich texture objects in indoor environments. Compared to existing depth sensing systems, the proposed system offers better performance in outdoor environments, better alignment with RGB images, and improved depth map completeness. The paper concludes with a discussion on the potential applications of the proposed system, such as object segmentation.
