The shape matching problem is a crucial topic in graphics and computer vision, with applications in various areas such as 3D reconstruction, tracking, shape modeling, and shape retrieval. While humans can easily identify correspondences between shapes, shape matching poses significant computational challenges. Many formulations of this problem result in high-dimensional combinatorial optimization problems. Simple approaches that neglect geometric relations between shape parts often yield poor matchings. On the other hand, formulations that incorporate geometric consistency lead to more difficult optimization problems, such as the NP-hard quadratic assignment problem or mixed-integer programming formulations. A decade ago, Windheuser et al. proposed a formalism for deformable 3D shape matching that considers geometric consistency based on an orientation-preserving discrete diffeomorphism. However, their approach requires solving a challenging integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which becomes infeasible for large-scale instances. This paper introduces a scalable combinatorial solver for geometrically consistent deformable 3D shape matching. The main contributions of this work include the proposal of a primal heuristic that, along with a Lagrange dual problem, forms a combinatorial solver for orientation-preserving deformable 3D shape matching. In the special case of consistent triangulations, the primal heuristic can solve the ILP formulation to global optimality in polynomial time. The proposed solver is significantly faster than previous ones, enabling the handling of shapes with higher resolution. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on various shape matching problems, including partial-to-partial shape matching.
