This paper introduces the task of unified text detection and geometric layout analysis, which aims to bridge the gap between individual text entity detection and layout analysis. Most existing works focus on these tasks separately, but we argue that jointly treating them can lead to simpler and more efficient models with improved accuracy. In order to facilitate research on this task, we also introduce a new dataset called HierText, which features hierarchical annotations of text in natural scenes and documents. This dataset includes word, line, and paragraph level annotations, and is denser than other existing scene text datasets. Along with HierText, we propose a novel model called Unified Detector that simultaneously detects text entities and performs layout analysis by grouping them. This model combines an end-to-end instance segmentation model with multi-head self-attention layers, enabling training and inference with a simplified pipeline. Experimental results show that Unified Detector outperforms competitive baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the unified task and standalone scene text detection task. In conclusion, our contributions include the proposal of the unified task, the introduction of the HierText dataset, and the development of an effective end-to-end model for unified text detection and layout analysis.
