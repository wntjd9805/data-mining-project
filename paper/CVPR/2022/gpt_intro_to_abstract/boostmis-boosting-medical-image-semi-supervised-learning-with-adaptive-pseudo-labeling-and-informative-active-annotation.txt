The development of deep learning in computer vision has contributed to advancements in automated medical image analysis. However, annotating medical datasets is a costly and time-consuming task. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is gaining traction as a method to leverage a limited amount of labeled data together with a large amount of unlabeled data. Pseudo-labeling, a specific variant of SSL, has shown success in image classification tasks by converting model predictions into pseudo-labels. However, image-based pseudo-labeling may not adequately address the challenges in medical imaging, including poor data utilization and the lack of informative samples. This paper proposes BoostMIS, a novel framework that combines active learning (AL) and SSL to enhance medical image SSL. The framework includes a medical image task model, a consistency-based adaptive label propagator, an adversarial instability selector, and a balanced uncertainty selector. The proposed framework is demonstrated to outperform existing SSL methods on a metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) dataset. The contributions of this paper include the incorporation of AL into SSL for medical image analysis, the development and evaluation of the MESCC dataset, and the demonstrated superiority of the BoostMIS framework.
