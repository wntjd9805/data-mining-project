Introduction:Depth sensing technology is widely utilized due to its diverse applications. The recovery of scene depth, known as "shape from X," relies on physics-based cues. Numerous cues, such as triangulation/disparity, time-of-flight, polarization, shading, silhouettes, focus/defocus, and texture, have been proposed historically. These cues play a crucial role in depth sensing in different scenarios. However, existing depth sensing techniques require either clear visibility of texture or active light sources to illuminate surfaces, lacking passive depth measurement capabilities in dark environments.This paper presents an innovative depth sensing modality applicable in dark and passive scenarios. Our approach utilizes the attenuation of long wavelength infrared (LWIR) radiation through the air as a key element. Since all objects emit thermal radiation based on their temperature, we can perceive objects without the need for active light sources. Additionally, the significant attenuation of LWIR compared to visible light, along with its exponential decay with respect to depth, enables depth recovery.To accurately estimate depth, we need to separate the influences of temperature and attenuation. Fortunately, the attenuation through the air is wavelength-dependent, allowing us to leverage multi-spectral observations in the LWIR range. The joint estimation of depth and temperature can be achieved using LWIR images, as shown in Figure 1.This paper primarily focuses on the feasibility of depth sensing solely using passive thermal radiation. The contributions of this study are twofold. Firstly, we propose a novel cue, "shape from thermal radiation," which exploits the attenuation of thermal radiation by the air. This concept broadens the research field in computer vision and computational imaging. Secondly, our proposed method is the first attempt to realize passive, texture-less depth sensing within far ranges and dark scenes. This achievement demonstrates the usefulness of air absorption cues in LWIR for depth sensing purposes.
