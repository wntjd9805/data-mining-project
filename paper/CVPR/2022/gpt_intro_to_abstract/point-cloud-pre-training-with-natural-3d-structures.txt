3D object recognition using 3D point clouds has great potential in real-world applications such as mobile robots and self-driving cars. Unlike image-based detection models, 3D point clouds offer robust detection of objects without relying on appearance. However, constructing 3D datasets is time-consuming and requires a significant workforce. This creates a need for alternative methods to create 3D models. The present study focuses on pre-training with point cloud datasets to overcome the challenges of limited data and annotation. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been proposed as a solution, with PointContrast demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training for scene understanding tasks. However, these methods are limited to pre-training a backbone network and the training data depend on the scale of the point cloud dataset. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a point cloud pre-training method based on formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) using fractal geometry. Fractal geometry, with its self-similarity and non-integer dimensions, allows the generation of fine-grained 3D structures that CAD models cannot represent. The proposed point cloud fractal database (PCFractalDB) automatically constructs a dataset based on natural 3D structures, eliminating the need for human annotation and data collection. The contributions of this study include the proposal of PC-FractalDB, which improves representation learning for 3D object detection without data collection or annotation. The PC-FractalDB pre-trained detector enhances performance on representative point cloud datasets. Additionally, the PC-FractalDB pre-training assists in fine-tuning with limited training data and annotation.
