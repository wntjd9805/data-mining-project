Deep neural networks have achieved impressive performance by minimizing average loss on training datasets. However, dataset bias can lead to significant degradation of worst-case generalization performance. Models may capture unintended decision rules from spurious correlations, resulting in poor worst-group and unbiased accuracies. To mitigate bias, learning debiased representations from a biased dataset has received attention. Previous works rely on explicit supervision or prior knowledge of dataset bias, which can be challenging to identify and annotate. This paper presents an unsupervised debiasing technique using feature clustering and cluster re-weighting. Bias pseudo-attributes are estimated unsupervised from clustering results, and a reweighting scheme is introduced to encourage minority clusters' participation in optimization for improving worst-group generalization. The proposed method is effective for debiasing without any supervision of bias information and achieves outstanding performance in terms of unbiased and worst-group accuracies. The main contributions include the proposal of an unsupervised debiasing approach, the technique to learn debiased representations through cluster identification and reweighting, and achieving competitive performance compared to supervised debiasing methods. Experimental results and analysis are provided, and the paper is organized as follows: a review of prior research, presentation of the proposed framework, empirical analysis, and conclusion.
