Photometric stereo is a technique used to recover surface normals of an object by observing it under different lighting conditions. It has the advantage of producing detailed 3D (or 2.5D) information through per-pixel recovery. However, photometric stereo is an ill-posed problem due to unknown object reflectance and lighting conditions. To make the problem tractable, different assumptions on shapes and reflectance have been utilized. The DiLiGenT benchmark dataset was created to evaluate photometric stereo methods, but it has limitations, such as a small data size and lack of interpretability for learning-based methods. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called DiLiGenT102, consisting of 100 objects with 10 shapes and 10 materials. These objects were fabricated using high-precision computer numerical control machining and have calibrated "ground truth" surface normal maps. DiLiGenT102 is the largest real-world photometric stereo benchmark dataset and allows for comprehensive evaluation of up-to-date methods, particularly learning-based ones. It provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. This paper presents the new dataset and its characteristics, including a larger scale than DiLiGenT, controlled shape and material variations, and comprehensive benchmark evaluation results. These results are presented as shape-material error matrices and serve as a reference for future work in the field.
