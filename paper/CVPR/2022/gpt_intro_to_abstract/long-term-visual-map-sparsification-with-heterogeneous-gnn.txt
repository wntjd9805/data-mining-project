Long-term visual localization in dynamic environments requires the ability to identify and remove outdated and invalid points from the accumulated map. Existing approaches based on subset selection lack the ability to adapt to environmental changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that formulates map sparsification as a learning problem using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). By representing the SfM map as a heterogeneous graph, we can incorporate the full context stored in the map and train the GNN with only partial queries. Our approach outperforms the traditional K-Cover method in visual localization performance on an outdoor long-term dataset with significant environmental changes. The proposed approach enables the selection of important points while discarding irrelevant ones, resulting in more efficient and accurate visual localization in dynamic environments.
