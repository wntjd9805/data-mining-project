This paper introduces the concept of compositional visual question answering (VQA), which involves answering questions about an image based on its content. Compositional questions consist of multiple visual concepts, requiring a comprehensive understanding of the image and compositional relational reasoning. Existing reasoning models for compositional VQA excel at answering the main compositional question but struggle with reasoning consistency when answering sub-questions related to known visual concepts. This inconsistency indicates errors in the reasoning process. To address this issue, the paper proposes a dialog-like reasoning method that integrates the reasoning processes for sub-questions into the overall reasoning process for the compositional question, ensuring reasoning consistency. The method utilizes a structured visual graph representation of the image and performs iterative language-guided graph convolution to learn contextual visual representations for compositional reasoning. The number of iterations is determined in advance. During the reasoning process, when the current number of iterations matches the required number for a sub-question, an answer classifier is used to answer the sub-question based on the visual representations. A consistency constraint is introduced to penalize inconsistent answer predictions. By answering sub-questions with guidance from the compositional question, the method aims to capture correlations between the main question and its sub-questions for improved consistency. The process of answering sub-questions can also be seen as intermediate supervision for the reasoning process of the compositional question. To evaluate the reasoning consistency in compositional VQA, the paper introduces the GQA-Sub dataset, derived from the GQA dataset, which enables quantitative measurement of reasoning consistency by assessing the consistency of predictions for the main question and its sub-questions. Experimental results on the GQA and GQA-Sub datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work and the contributions of the research.
