Image denoising is a significant problem in computer vision, and supervised learning approaches have proven to be more effective than classical denoising algorithms. However, these approaches require a large number of clean image pairs for training, which limits their practical applicability. To overcome this limitation, researchers have proposed self-supervised learning approaches that do not rely on clean reference images. These approaches formulate loss functions that prevent learning identity mapping and can be categorized into two classes: generating altered target images or adding regularization terms based on Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimation (SURE). While these approaches seem different, a recent study revealed their close relationship to score matching, which leads to a Bayes optimal denoising formula. However, existing methods require prior knowledge of the noise distribution, limiting their performance in unknown noise scenarios.This paper presents a novel discovery that the classical Tweedie distribution can provide a general denoising formulation for a wide range of noise distributions, even without knowledge of the specific distribution. By combining the Tweedie distribution with the Noise2Score approach, an explicit denoising formulation and an algorithm for estimating the underlying noise model and parameters are proposed. The algorithm leverages the fact that various exponential family distributions can be approximated by the Tweedie distribution through a simple parameter change. Additionally, a systematic algorithm is introduced to estimate the noise type and associated parameters for any given image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other self-supervised image denoising methods trained with prior noise distribution knowledge.The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:1. A general closed-form denoising formula is provided for a wide range of noise distributions by combining the Noise2Score approach and the saddle point approximation of the Tweedie distribution.2. An algorithm is proposed to estimate the noise model and noise parameters for given noisy images. This algorithm significantly improves performance and inference speed compared to the original Noise2Score approach.3. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among various self-supervised image denoising algorithms in both benchmark and real-environment datasets.
