Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a neural volumetric scene representation that generates photorealistic images of 3D scenes from novel viewpoints. However, NeRFs suffer from spurious glossy artifacts in their renderings, particularly in specular highlights, which do not behave realistically. This is due to two fundamental issues: poor parameterization of outgoing radiance at each point and the use of isotropic emitters for specular reflections. To address these issues, we propose Ref-NeRF, which reparameterizes NeRF's directional MLP by reflecting the viewing vector about the local normal vector. This simplified representation allows for better interpolation of view-dependent appearance and more realistic rendering. We also introduce an Integrated Directional Encoding technique and split outgoing radiance into diffuse and specular components to achieve smooth interpolation despite variations in materials and textures. Additionally, we develop a regularization method to improve the quality of NeRF's normal vectors and concentrate volume density around surfaces. Our experiments demonstrate that Ref-NeRF outperforms previous methods in rendering novel viewpoints, especially for highly specular or glossy objects. It also enables scene editing capabilities through interpretable components.
