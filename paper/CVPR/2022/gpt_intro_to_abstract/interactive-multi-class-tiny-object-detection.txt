Large-scale data and annotations are crucial for successful deep learning. However, annotating large datasets can be labor-intensive and expensive, especially when dealing with numerous tiny objects. This is a common challenge in fields such as remote sensing, extreme weather research, and microscope image analysis. Current methods for reducing annotation costs, such as interactive segmentation and object counting, do not fully address the complexities of annotating tiny objects from multiple classes.To address this, we propose C3Det, an interactive annotation framework for tiny object detection. C3Det allows users to create bounding boxes for numerous tiny objects from multiple classes through a series of interactions. The framework takes user inputs and detects bounding boxes for objects, including those from classes not specified by the user. By leveraging user inputs in a "many interactions to many instances" and "many classes to many classes" manner, C3Det significantly speeds up annotation.A key aspect of our approach is the consideration of both local and global context when making each user click influence nearby and far-away objects. To ensure consistency between user inputs and model predictions, we use a class-consistency loss and insert user inputs at an intermediate stage in the model. However, this approach may miss far-away objects, so we introduce the C3 (Class-wise Collated Correlation) module to communicate local information to distant objects.We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, a user study involving 10 human annotators confirms that C3Det, in combination with manual bounding box corrections, is 2.85 times faster and reduces task load compared to manual annotation. Importantly, this improvement does not come at the expense of annotation quality.In summary, our contributions include addressing the challenges of multi-class and multi-instance interactive annotation of tiny objects, introducing a training data synthesis and evaluation procedure, proposing a novel architecture that considers both local and global implications of user inputs, and demonstrating the reduction of annotation costs while achieving high annotation quality through experiments and a user study.
