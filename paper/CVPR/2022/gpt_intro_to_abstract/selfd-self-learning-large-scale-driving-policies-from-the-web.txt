This paper addresses the challenges of learning generalized models for robust vision-based navigation in complex and dynamic settings. While humans can easily transfer navigation knowledge across different settings, current real-world navigation agents are typically developed within a fixed assumed setting and calibrated sensor configurations, requiring specific data collection and annotation efforts for each use case. This leads to brittle navigation models that struggle with the complexity of real-world navigation tasks. However, there is a vast amount of diverse and freely available navigation data uploaded to the web. The goal of this paper is to effectively utilize this data to improve the efficiency, safety, and scalability of real-world navigation agents.There are two main challenges in using online data for training navigation policies. First, existing prediction and decision-making methods rely on assumptions of planar scenes and known camera parameters, which limits their applicability to online images collected in various layouts and camera settings. Second, methods for learning decision-making in complex navigation settings often assume access to curated benchmarks with clean annotations, which is not possible when learning from unlabeled internet videos. To address these challenges, this paper proposes leveraging iterative semi-supervised learning techniques and introduces a model that maps monocular observations directly to a Bird's Eye View planning space without requiring camera calibration.The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, a model is developed for mapping monocular observations to a Bird's Eye View planning space without the need for camera calibration, facilitating learning from unconstrained imagery. Second, a novel semi-supervised learning approach is introduced that incorporates self-training with "hypothetical" data augmentation, allowing for the effective use of diverse demonstration data. Finally, cross-dataset experiments are performed to analyze the generalization capabilities of a decision-making model trained with minimal assumptions about the underlying data. State-of-the-art model generalization performance is demonstrated across various datasets with complex navigation and harsh conditions.
