Similarity learning is a fundamental task in computer vision, with metric learning methods being most prevalent. These methods employ a distance metric to measure similarities between samples, transforming features into an embedding space and defining dissimilarity as the Euclidean distance in this space. While traditional methods use hand-crafted features, deep metric learning methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract more representative features and achieve superior performance.In recent years, similarity learning has been widely applied in various computer vision tasks, including face recognition, person re-identification, and image classification. The goal of visual similarity learning is to obtain a similarity measure that generalizes well to unseen data. The human visual system achieves good generalization by parsing objects into parts and relations and learning underlying concepts. Humans also infer similarity hierarchically by comparing high-level features before delving into lower-level features.However, most existing similarity learning methods project each sample into a single vector and employ the Mahalanobis distance or Euclidean distance as the similarity function. This approach only uses top-level features to represent an image and does not involve inference. Moreover, using a single vector for similarity measurement results in unexplainable similarity measurement due to the black-box nature of CNNs.To address these issues, we propose an attributable visual similarity learning (AVSL) framework that actively explains the learned similarity measurement. We generalize the metric learning paradigm by representing the similarity between images as a graph and analyzing it to infer overall similarity. CNNs are used to extract hierarchical visual features in a bottom-up manner, where higher-level features encode more abstract concepts. We construct an undirected graph to represent similarity between images and propose a top-down similarity inference method based on hierarchy consistency. Starting from high-level similarity nodes, we rectify identified unreliable nodes using adjacent low-level similarity nodes, simulating how humans compare objects from coarse to fine. This framework can easily be applied to existing deep metric learning methods, and experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate its significant performance boost and state-of-the-art results. Visualization experiments illustrate the attributability and interpretability of our method.
