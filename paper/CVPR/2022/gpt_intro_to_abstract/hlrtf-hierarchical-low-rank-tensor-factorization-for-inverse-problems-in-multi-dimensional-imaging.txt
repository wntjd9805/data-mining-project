Tensor factorization methods are widely used for analyzing and processing multi-dimensional images, such as videos and hyperspectral images. These methods take advantage of the low-rank structures present in real-world multi-dimensional images. Traditional tensor factorization methods rely on multilinear operations, but recent studies have explored tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) as an alternative. In this paper, we focus on the t-SVD and propose a new tensor rank called hierarchical-tubal-rank (HLRTF). We replace the linear transform used in traditional tensor factorization methods with a deep neural network (DNN) to achieve a better low-rank representation. We introduce the hierarchical low-rank tensor factorization (HLRTF) method, which factorizes a tensor into two smaller tensors using the t-product induced by the DNN transform. We also develop an equivalent form of HLRTF to reduce computational expense. To solve inverse problems in multi-dimensional imaging, we simultaneously optimize the tensor factors and learn the inverse DNN. We propose the parametric total variation (PTV) regularization to address the vanishing gradient issue in extreme cases. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HLRTF for various tasks in multi-dimensional imaging, including image completion, denoising, and snapshot spectral imaging.
