In recent years, weakly-supervised localization temporal (WTAL) has gained attention as an alternative to fully-supervised methods due to its easier data collection process and scalability. Most existing WTAL methods rely on multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, treating the entire untrimmed video as a labeled bag with multiple unlabeled instances. However, there are still major challenges in achieving localization completeness and detecting short action segments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ASM-Loc that addresses these challenges by introducing action-aware segment modeling. We utilize action proposals generated by MIL-based methods and introduce three segment-centric modules in different stages of the WTAL pipeline. These modules include a dynamic segment sampling module to balance short and long action segments, intra- and inter-segment attention modules to capture temporal structures, and a pseudo instance-level loss for refinement. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets. This work highlights the importance of segment-based modeling in narrowing the performance gap between weakly-supervised and supervised settings in WTAL.
