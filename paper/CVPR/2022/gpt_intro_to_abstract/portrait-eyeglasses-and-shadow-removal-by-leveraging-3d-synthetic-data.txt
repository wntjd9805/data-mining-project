This paper introduces an automatic technique for removing eyeglasses from portrait photos, addressing the challenges of recovering the occluded facial region and modeling the lighting effects caused by eyeglasses. The authors propose a novel mask-guided multi-step network architecture that detects and removes both eyeglasses and their cast shadows, resulting in visually plausible results. A synthetic dataset is created using high-quality face scans and 3D eyeglasses models, allowing for supervised training that covers various identities, expressions, eyeglasses, and illuminations. To bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, a cross-domain segmentation module is developed using a real image dataset. The contributions of this paper include the novel network architecture, the creation of a high-quality synthetic dataset, and the introduction of a cross-domain segmentation module for enhanced generalization on real face images.
