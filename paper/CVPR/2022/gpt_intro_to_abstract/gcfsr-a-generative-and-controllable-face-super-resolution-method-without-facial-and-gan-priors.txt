Face image super resolution (SR) algorithms have seen significant development in recent years due to their wide application in video restoration and AI photography. These algorithms aim to reconstruct accurate structures and preserve identity information in face images. Face SR is closely related to general image SR and face generation tasks. However, face SR presents unique challenges as it deals with very large upscaling factors and requires the generation of finer details. Previous approaches have relied on additional facial priors, such as parsing maps and attribution maps, to achieve satisfactory results. Recent advancements have shown that face generative adversarial network (GAN) models can replace these facial priors and produce realistic face details. These GAN models contain sufficient face information and strong priors. However, relying on such priors poses limitations, as face GAN models are trained on specific datasets and cannot handle diverse types of face images. Additionally, adapting face GAN models for face SR requires additional operations in the network, which can be computationally expensive. The question arises: Can we design a pure data-driven framework that eliminates the need for these priors?Another challenge in face SR is the lack of flexibility in generation. Existing methods produce a single restoration result with a fixed style, limiting their adaptability to different scenarios and personalized requirements. Controlling the amount of generated details is a practical demand in face SR. Furthermore, real-world images come in various sizes, while conventional SR models can only handle fixed upscaling factors.To address these challenges, we propose a generative and controllable face SR framework called GCFSR. This framework reconstructs faithful images while generating realistic face details without relying on additional priors. Its generative strength can be interactively adjusted, allowing for adaptive handling of different upscaling factors. GCFSR achieves these properties through an encoder-generator architecture, style modulation, and feature modulation modules. The architecture is concise and does not require extra priors or initialization. GCFSR is end-to-end trainable and converges quickly. It can achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal pixel-wise constraints and a single GAN loss for small upscaling factors. Extensive experiments and ablations studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, with GCFSR outperforming GAN-based methods in small and large upscaling factors. The qualitative results demonstrate vivid face details and gradually modulated effects.
