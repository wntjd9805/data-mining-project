This paper addresses the problem of partial permutation synchronization (PPS), which arises from the task of multi-object matching (MOM). MOM involves matching keypoints from multiple objects, where each object has distinct labels. The goal is to recover the ground truth labels for each keypoint. In the context of structure from motion (SfM), MOM is known as multi-image matching. PPS formulates the problem as recovering partial permutation matrices that represent the keypoint-to-universe matches. The corruption of pairwise measurements in real data can be nonuniform, and the size and sparsity levels of the partial permutations can vary. This paper presents a fast, accurate, and memory-efficient PPS algorithm that can handle nontrivial corruption models and large-scale real data.
