Dashed curves are frequently used in various drawing and illustration applications, but their recognition by computers is challenging due to the need for high-level semantic understanding. This paper addresses three major challenges in recognizing dashed curves: different compositions of solid curve segments, intersection of multiple curves, and noisy background. Traditional methods based on manual heuristics have limitations and cannot handle complex inputs. Previous methods for 3D point cloud line detection and deep learning-based vectorization and contour detection are not directly applicable. The paper proposes a novel approach that combines high-level features and low-level clues to recognize dashed curves. Inspired by Gestalt psychology, the method constructs a high-level understanding of dashed curves and uses it to facilitate curve extraction and vectorization. Three deep learning networks are trained together to aggregate curve descriptors, construct pixel-level dashed curves, and predict the analytic form of recognized curves. The proposed framework achieves accurate and robust recognition of dashed curves in experiments, making the following major contributions: an end-to-end framework for accurate and robust recognition and extraction of dashed curves based on semantic meaning, the incorporation of the Gestalt law of grouping and continuity as an explicit constraint, and simultaneous learning of the Gestalt law in the feature, raster, and vector domains with specially crafted supervision.
