Abstract:The widespread distribution of pirated multimedia content in recent years has become a major concern for users and platforms globally. The influx of user-generated and professionally-generated content on sharing platforms has contributed to the rise in pirated content. Detecting copyright infringement has become challenging as individuals develop techniques to evade detection algorithms. Apart from copyright protection, video copy detection systems are important for various applications such as video classification, tracking, filtering, and recommendation. However, existing datasets for copy detection have limitations, with limited segment-level annotations and unrealistic simulated copied segments. To address these issues, we introduce a comprehensive dataset called VCSL, specifically designed for segment-level video copy detection. This publicly available dataset includes over 160,000 infringed video pairs with carefully annotated segment pairs, covering various video topics. Additionally, we propose a more realistic evaluation protocol that considers the entire copied videos as input, avoiding the reliance on ground-truth copied segments. We also introduce a benchmark suite for segment-level video copy detection, evaluating baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms on the VCSL dataset. This benchmark suite will aid researchers in evaluating their methods and advancing the field of segment-level video copy detection.
