The introduction of this computer science paper highlights the demand for alternative methods of large-scale localization due to vulnerabilities in satellite positioning signals. The paper discusses the challenges of residual drift in dead-reckoning navigation systems and the popularity of using low-cost cameras as sensors in capturing surrounding landscape information. While machine-learning-based methods for absolute localization show promise, they often focus on single-domain operation and lack inclusive datasets for real-world aerial scenarios. To address this, the paper introduces TOPO-DataGen, a synthetic data generation scheme that leverages topographic information to create geo-referenced data for training. The paper also introduces two large-scale benchmark datasets created using the proposed data generation workflow, which showcase the use of synthetic data to assist localization in the real world. Additionally, the paper presents CrossLoc, a cross-modal visual representation learning approach that improves absolute localization through scene coordinate regression. The paper concludes by summarizing its contributions, which include TOPO-DataGen, the benchmark datasets, and the CrossLoc approach.
