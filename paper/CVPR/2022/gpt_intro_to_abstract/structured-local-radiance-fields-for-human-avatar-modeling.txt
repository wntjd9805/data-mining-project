Abstract:Animatable human avatar modeling is crucial in various applications such as content creation and entertainment. Traditional methods for high-quality human avatar reconstruction are costly and tedious. Additionally, they rely on subject-specific templates and accurate registration, which are challenging to obtain in practice. Recent advancements in computer vision have explored the possibility of automatic human avatar reconstruction without pre-scanning efforts. These methods typically use a statistical human body template and neural networks for modeling clothed human geometry and appearance. However, existing approaches heavily rely on the skeleton or surface of the template for cloth motion modeling, limiting their effectiveness for loose clothes and non-rigid deformations. To address these limitations, we propose a new representation for clothed human characters using neural radiance fields (NeRF). Our approach breaks down a global NeRF into structured local radiance fields attached to nodes on the human body template. Each local radiance field represents shape and appearance in the local space around its corresponding node, driven by body skeleton motion and capturing non-rigid garment deformations through residual movements. Furthermore, each radiance field is conditioned on a dynamic detail embedding to encode high-frequency dynamic details. We address the challenge of acquiring node-related variables by introducing a conditional variational auto-encoder (cVAE) for each radiance field, which converts latent bottlenecks into node-related variables conditioned on pose parameters. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end manner using RGB videos, enabling the automatic creation of animatable human avatars with general, dynamic garments. Compared to existing methods, our approach offers superior appearance learning and motion modeling capabilities, generating realistic dynamic details. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches qualitatively and quantitatively, and is the first to demonstrate automatic human avatar creation for dresses.
