This paper introduces a new deep-learning-based stochastic model called D2-SONATA (Deep Decomposition for Stochastic Normal-Abnormal Transport), designed to predict the underlying advection-diffusion parameters from observed transport time-series with potential anomalies in both 2D and 3D. The main contributions of this work are: 1) a learning-based stochastic advection-diffusion model that reconstructs the transport dynamics and captures epistemic uncertainties with Brownian motion, 2) representation theorems for anomaly-decomposed divergence-free vector fields and symmetric PSD tensor fields, which provide realistic constraints on the learned advection-diffusion parameter fields, and 3) the development of a 2D/3D normal-abnormal advection-diffusion dataset with a simulator that generates velocity vector and diffusion tensor fields with artificial anomalies for supervised model pre-training. The proposed D2-SONATA model aims to improve upon existing approaches for estimating advection-diffusion parameters by addressing the uncertainty in the results, incorporating regional anomalies, and mitigating biases towards normal parameterizations.
