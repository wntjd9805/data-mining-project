3D point cloud semantic segmentation is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, and augmented reality. While numerous methods have been developed for point cloud segmentation, little attention has been given to segmentation on scene boundaries. Accurate segmentation on boundaries is important for overall segmentation performance and recognition of object categories with fewer points. Previous segmentation methods often overlook boundary segmentation or perform unsatisfactorily. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Boundary Learning (CBL) framework to optimize segmentation performance on boundaries. We introduce metrics such as mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) and boundary IoU (B-IoU) to measure segmentation performance on boundary areas separately from inner areas. We also develop a sub-scene boundary mining strategy to improve feature representation around boundary areas. Experimental results demonstrate that CBL significantly improves boundary segmentation and overall performance across multiple baselines and datasets. Our contributions include quantifying the boundary problem, proposing the CBL framework, and showing consistent improvements in boundary segmentation and overall performance. Accurate boundary segmentation is essential for robust 3D segmentation.
