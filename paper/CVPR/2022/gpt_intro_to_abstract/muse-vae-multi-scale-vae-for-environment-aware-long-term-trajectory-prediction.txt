Human behavior forecasting is a challenging problem studied in various fields such as computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, and cognitive science. The uncertainty in predicting human motion arises from the fact that humans make decisions based on multiple sources of information, leading to a wide variety of future movement possibilities. This uncertainty also extends to objects controlled by humans, such as vehicles.In this paper, we propose a computational model, MUSE-VAE, that aims to predict realistic multi-modal distributions of future agent trajectories (humans, vehicles, etc.). The model takes into account the environment and the task the agents are attempting to accomplish, addressing the uncertainty in a comprehensive manner.Direct long-term trajectory forecasting is a challenging task, as humans typically plan their movement in a coarse-to-fine fashion, with intermediate goals or waypoints. Existing state-of-the-art methods leverage this intuition but struggle with complex environments and diversity of forecast goals and trajectories. They often produce physically implausible predictions that violate collision constraints.To address these limitations, MUSE-VAE adopts a multi-scale, environment-aware approach to trajectory prediction. It predicts both higher-level goals and goal-conditioned trajectories in a stage-wise manner. The model avoids collisions with obstacles and captures the multi-modal nature of the problem by learning a predictive distribution across the stages.MUSE-VAE incorporates a three-step learning strategy, including a Macro-stage for coarse predictions and a Micro-stage for producing full trajectories. The model demonstrates several contributions, including a novel multi-scale learning strategy, the ability to generalize well in new scenes, and an accurate and diverse trajectory prediction approach.Experimental evaluation on real and synthetic datasets shows that MUSE-VAE produces predictions similar to ground truth trajectories while achieving fewer collisions with the environment compared to state-of-the-art methods.Overall, MUSE-VAE offers a comprehensive solution for long-term trajectory prediction, considering environmental factors and capturing the inherent uncertainty in human behavior forecasting. The model's effectiveness and accuracy are demonstrated through extensive experiments.
