Instance segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in various fields such as autonomous driving and robotics. While significant progress has been made in recent years using deep convolutional neural networks and object detection, developing real-time and efficient instance segmentation algorithms remains a challenge.Existing methods typically use detectors to localize instances and then perform segmentation using region-based convolutional networks. However, these methods suffer from certain limitations when it comes to real-time instance segmentation. They often employ dense anchors or centers for localization, resulting in redundant predictions and high computational burden. Moreover, densely localizing objects by centers or anchors leads to limited receptive fields and inadequate contextual information.Another limitation of prevalent methods is the requirement for multi-level prediction to handle scale variation, which increases latency. Region-based methods that use RoI-Align for acquiring region features further limit the deployment of algorithms on edge or embedded devices. Additionally, the post-processing steps, including sorting and non-maximum suppression (NMS), as well as processing masks, are time-consuming.To address these challenges, we propose SparseInst, a pure and fully convolutional framework that is independent of detectors. SparseInst leverages sparse predictions through instance activation maps, enabling single-level prediction and compact structures. This framework eliminates the need for NMS or sorting in post-processing, resulting in extremely fast inference speed. On the MS-COCO test-dev dataset, SparseInst achieves 37.9 mask average precision (AP) with a frame rate of 40.0 frames per second (FPS) on a NVIDIA 2080Ti GPU. Furthermore, with a smaller input size of 448Ã—, SparseInst achieves a frame rate of 58.5 FPS while maintaining competitive accuracy.We believe that the proposed SparseInst framework can serve as a general solution for real-time and end-to-end instance segmentation. Its superior speed and accuracy make it well-suited for applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and other domains.
