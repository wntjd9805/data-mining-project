Recovering the geometry, materials, and lighting of a 3D scene from images, also known as inverse rendering, has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. With the rise of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications, there is a growing demand for easily acquiring 3D content from the real world. Existing capture systems have limitations in terms of user-friendliness. Recent works explore flexible capture settings under natural illumination.This paper proposes an efficient approach to reconstructing spatially varying indirect illumination in order to precisely recover the surface reflectance properties of objects from multi-view RGB images captured under unknown static illumination. The key innovation is in modeling the indirect illumination using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) that maps a 3D surface point to its indirect incoming illumination. This MLP can be learned separately from the surface reflectance properties and environmental light, and can be derived from the outgoing radiance field of the scene using off-the-shelf neural scene representation methods.The proposed method first learns the geometry and outgoing radiance field of the object from input images. Then, the learned radiance field serves as the ground-truth incoming illumination to train the indirect illumination MLP. This learned indirect illumination is then incorporated into the rendering equation during the optimization of the surface reflectance properties and environmental light.By directly querying the indirect illumination without the need for expensive recursive path tracing, the inverse rendering problem is better constrained and more efficient to solve. Additionally, a prior is introduced to reduce the ambiguity in disentangling the surface reflectance properties and incident light, based on the assumption that real-world objects consist of limited types of materials.Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods, producing shadow- and interreflection-free albedo, high-quality roughness, and supporting realistic free-viewpoint re-lighting.
