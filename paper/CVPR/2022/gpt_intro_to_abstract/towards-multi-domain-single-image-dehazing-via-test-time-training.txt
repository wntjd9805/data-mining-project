Single image dehazing is a well-known topic in computer vision, aiming to restore clear images from hazy ones. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of neural network-based approaches for dehazing by training on specific datasets. However, these methods fail to address the challenge of handling different types of hazy images across multiple datasets. Training a single dehazing model on all available datasets together may seem like a straightforward solution, but it actually compromises the dehazing performance on individual datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach to enable a single dehazing model to cope with multiple domains. The approach involves adjusting the dehazing network during the testing phase using a self-supervised loss function provided by a helper network. The helper network learns diverse haze patterns and assesses the quality of the dehazed image. The dehazing network's parameters are optimized by minimizing the reconstruction loss of the helper network, ultimately optimizing the end-to-end performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the multi-domain dehazing problem.
