Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in various fields, such as autonomous driving and video analysis. MOT methods typically follow a two-step process: detection, which generates potential box predictions of target objects, and data association, which matches the predicted boxes across frames. Recently, there has been a growing interest in multi-object tracking in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) views. However, tracking objects under moving UAV views presents unique challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-object tracker specifically designed for tracking objects in moving UAV videos. We address challenges in both detection and data association stages by introducing an ID feature update module to enhance object ID embedding features and an adaptive motion filter to handle the irregular motions of UAV. To address imbalanced categories and small-scale objects detection, we propose a gradient balanced focal loss. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed UAVMOT tracker accurately tracks multiple objects in UAV views. The contributions of this work include the ID feature update module, the adaptive motion filter, and the gradient balanced focal loss that improve multi-object tracking performance in UAV videos.
