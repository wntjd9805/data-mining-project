Domain generalized semantic segmentation is a challenging task in computer vision, as it requires accurately predicting pixel-level semantic labels on unseen target domains while only having access to source domain data during training. The domain shift between the source and target domains poses a significant problem, leading to poor generalization performance on unseen domains. This issue is primarily caused by overfitting to the source domain during training.To address this problem, previous studies have proposed methods for learning domain-generalized content features by removing domain-specific style information from the data. However, these approaches often suffer from a loss of semantic content due to the non-orthogonal nature of content and style. As a result, making accurate predictions becomes challenging.In this paper, we introduce a new semantic segmentation network called WildNet that learns domain-generalized semantic features by extending both content and style to the wild. Unlike previous works that focus primarily on the style, our approach leverages a variety of contents and styles from the wild to achieve superior generalization performance.To extend both content and style to the wild, we propose four learning methods. First, we use feature stylization to diversify the style of the source feature by transferring the statistics of the wild feature. This helps in reducing overfitting to the source contents. Second, we introduce content extension learning to increase intra-class content variability in the latent embedding space. By extending content from the source to the wild, our network can make generalized predictions on unseen contents. Third, we propose style extension learning to encourage the adaptation of the network to various styles extended to the wild, preventing overfitting to the source style. Finally, semantic consistency regularization is employed to capture consistent semantic information even when both the content and style of the source domain are extended to the wild.Our experiments demonstrate that WildNet outperforms existing methods on domain generalization for semantic segmentation across multiple domains. The network achieves superior performance by leveraging the variety of contents and styles from the wild, without relying on whitening techniques. In summary, our contributions include the introduction of WildNet, a novel domain generalized semantic segmentation network, and the proposal of four learning techniques to extend both content and style to the wild, enabling reliable predictions on unseen target domains.
