Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) aims to detect objects and their relationships in images, represented as (subject, predicate, object) triplets. VRD is a crucial task in computer vision, as it can benefit various high-level image understanding tasks. While deep learning methods have been proposed for VRD, they often rely on semantic information and suffer from limitations such as the need for a large amount of labeled data and lack of interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel bi-level probabilistic graphical reasoning (BPGR) framework that combines symbolic knowledge with VRD models. The framework utilizes Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) for knowledge representation and integrates probabilistic inference for explicit reasoning. The BPGR framework consists of a visual reasoning module and a symbolic reasoning module, where the latter guides the reasoning of the former using symbolic knowledge. The proposed framework achieves superior performance on VRD datasets and provides interpretable reasoning results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the BPGR framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.
