Temporal Action Localization (TAL) is a crucial task in video understanding that involves locating the start and end times of action instances in long untrimmed videos. This task has gained significant attention in recent years due to its applications in security surveillance and human behavior analysis. Current TAL approaches typically extract features from video snippets using a pre-trained two-stream network and then aggregate these features to obtain representations for action classification and temporal boundary regression. These snippet-level features can be categorized into action components and co-occurrence components. The former captures the motion pattern of individuals and their interaction with objects, while the latter includes class-specific context and class-agnostic background. Balancing these two components is crucial for robust TAL, as relying too heavily on co-occurrence components can blur action boundaries, while ignoring them can lead to ambiguous and uncertain action representations. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Refactoring Network (RefactorNet) to address this problem. RefactorNet decouples the action and co-occurrence components from the snippet-level features and recombines them into a more suitable representation for effective TAL. To achieve this, we introduce a feature decoupling module and a feature recombining module. The decoupling process is supervised using both action samples and coupling samples, which assist in separating the two components effectively. The recombined snippet representations obtained from RefactorNet improve both action classification and temporal boundary regression, leading to state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. Our contributions include addressing the underexplored problem of balancing the action and co-occurrence components, proposing the first approach for explicit refactoring of these components, and designing effective learning objectives and supervision strategies for the decoupling process. Extensive experimental results and visualizations are presented to validate the effectiveness of RefactorNet.
