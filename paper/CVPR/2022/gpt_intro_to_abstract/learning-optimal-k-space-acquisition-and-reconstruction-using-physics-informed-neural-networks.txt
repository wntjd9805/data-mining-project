Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used in clinical settings for disease diagnosis due to its non-invasive and radiation-free nature. However, standard MRI acquisition techniques often require a long scan time, which can be problematic for patients who are unable to tolerate lengthy scans. Additionally, motion artifact caused by different types of motion during scanning can degrade image quality. To address these challenges, accelerated MRI techniques have been developed, including parallel imaging and compressed sensing, which leverage multi-coil information and image sparsity, respectively, to increase imaging efficiency.Recently, deep learning methods using neural networks have emerged as a promising approach for reconstructing undersampled k-space data, effectively removing image artifacts and noise. However, while existing studies have focused on developing novel reconstruction networks and training strategies, little attention has been given to optimizing the k-space acquisition process itself.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accelerate MRI by learning the optimal k-space sampling pattern for deep learning-based image reconstruction. We formulate the k-space acquisition as a dynamic optimization process and solve it using a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). We initialize the ODE system with regular Cartesian and Non-Cartesian k-space trajectories and dynamically adjust the trajectories towards an optimal pattern that maximizes acquisition efficiency.Furthermore, we implement a joint training strategy to optimize both the neural ODE system and a deep learning reconstruction model, ensuring optimal data acquisition and image reconstruction. We evaluate our method using the publicly available fastMRI database and compare it with existing techniques. Our results demonstrate that our proposed method improves reconstruction performance for both Cartesian and Non-Cartesian acquisitions across different MRI image sequences.The contributions of this work include the introduction of a novel k-space acquisition optimization strategy using neural ODE, the synergistic combination of neural ODE and deep learning-based reconstruction for maximal acquisition efficiency and performance, the incorporation of MRI hardware constraints in trajectory optimization, and the significant improvement in acquisition efficiency and image quality for various imaging scenarios.In summary, this paper presents a novel approach to accelerate MRI by learning the optimal k-space sampling pattern. Our method not only improves acquisition efficiency but also enhances image quality, making it a promising technique for clinical applications.
