Scene text recognition (STR) is a challenging task that aims to recognize text in natural scenes. While traditional OCR techniques have been used for text recognition, STR presents additional difficulties due to variations in font styles, layouts, and environmental factors. This paper introduces a robust consistency regularization based semi-supervised framework for STR, which leverages synthetic labeled data and unlabeled real data for training. The proposed approach addresses the domain gap between synthetic and real data, as well as the alignment challenge in sequence prediction tasks. A character-level consistency regularization unit is introduced to ensure better sequence alignment, and various techniques such as weight decay and domain adaptation are employed to improve the performance of the STR models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple text recognition benchmarks for regular and irregular text. This approach offers a more efficient alternative to self-training methods, as it does not require iterative prediction and re-training. By leveraging unlabeled data and synthetic data, the proposed framework overcomes the limitations of traditional fully supervised approaches, which often rely on small labeled datasets. Overall, this paper contributes a new approach for STR that improves the accuracy and stability of text recognition in diverse real-world scenarios.
