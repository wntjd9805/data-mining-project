Object detection has been a successful task in computer vision, but current models are limited to a closed set of categories for which there is abundant training data. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to overcome this limitation by training models to detect novel categories with only a few annotations, while maintaining performance on the base categories. This paper examines the training procedure of the Faster R-CNN two-stage detector and identifies two factors that limit its performance on FSOD: supervision collapse and the imbalance of training data for base and novel categories. To address these issues, the authors propose a pseudo-labelling technique that modifies the Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose regions for novel categories and uses a detector trained with few-shot novel data to label these regions. They also introduce a novel verification and correction procedure to improve the precision of these pseudo-annotations. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that their approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on benchmark datasets, such as MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC.
