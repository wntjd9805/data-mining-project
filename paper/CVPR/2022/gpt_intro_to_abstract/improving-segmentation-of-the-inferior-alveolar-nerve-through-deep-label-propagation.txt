Dental implant placement is a common surgical procedure that can be complicated by the presence of the Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) in the jawbone. Accurate segmentation of the IAN is crucial to avoid contact with the nerve during surgery. However, the current standard practice in dentistry and maxillofacial radiology centers relies on sparse 2D annotations, which fail to capture important information about the IAN and the bone structure. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results for segmentation tasks in both 2D and 3D. However, the lack of carefully annotated 3D data hinders the full potential of deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel label propagation method that can translate sparse 2D labels into dense 3D voxel-level annotations. We also design a new 3D segmentation CNN that leverages positional information for accurate 3D IAN segmentation. To evaluate our methods, we present a new dataset with voxel-level annotations. Our contributions include the label propagation technique, the 3D segmentation architecture, the publicly released dataset, and the source code for reproducibility. The rest of the paper discusses related work, describes the dataset and proposed methods, presents experimental results, and concludes with a summary of our findings.
