Face recognition has become widely used in various applications such as FaceID and surveillance monitoring. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the adoption of touch-less biometric technologies, including face recognition for payment and access control. Despite significant progress, face recognition still faces challenges, including vulnerability to adversarial attacks and the need to scale representation learning to support diverse local environments while reducing fairness and bias issues. This paper focuses on the problem of adapting a pre-trained global model to a specialized model that is tailored for a specific local environment in an automatic and unsupervised manner. The proposed approach, called Local-Adaptive Face Recognition (LaFR), employs an unsupervised adaptation technique that does not transfer data to a server. The workflow involves deploying the global model to a specific environment, accumulating new data, and adapting the model locally. Additionally, Federated Learning is used to aggregate multiple local models in a secure manner. The paper introduces a graph-based meta-clustering algorithm for predicting pseudo labels for unlabeled datasets and proposes a technique for transferring the representation of class centers from the pre-trained model to the new model's classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other baselines for local adaptation and enables further improvement through federated learning.
