Backdoor attacks on deep learning models pose a significant threat due to their ability to inject malicious behaviors and cause misclassification of inputs. Existing defense techniques such as trigger inversion, attribution analysis, and trojaned input detection have limitations in detecting advanced attacks with large and dynamic triggers. In this paper, we propose a new scanning technique called EX-RAY (DEtecting CompleX BackdooR in NeurAl Networks by SYmmetric Feature Differencing) that can detect such complex backdoors. Our technique leverages a novel symmetric feature differencing method, which identifies the distinctive features between two sets of examples. We evaluate EX-RAY on a large number of models and compare it with state-of-the-art trigger inversion based scanners. Our results show that EX-RAY achieves significantly higher accuracy in detecting trojaned models. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EX-RAY in reducing false positives and improving overall accuracy. On the TrojAI leaderboard, ABS+EX-RAY achieves top performance in multiple rounds of image classification, outperforming other state-of-the-art scanning techniques. Our method provides an important contribution to the field of backdoor detection and will be released publicly upon publication.
