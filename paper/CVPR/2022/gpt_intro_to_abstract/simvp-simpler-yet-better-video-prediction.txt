A wise person can foresee the future, and so should an intelligent vision model do. Video prediction has gained attention in various domains such as climate change, human motion forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and representation learning. Many methods have been developed to tackle the complexity and randomness of video, utilizing novel neural operators, delicate architectures, and distinct training strategies. However, there is limited understanding of the necessity of these techniques and their impact on performance. In this paper, we propose SimVP, a simpler yet effective video prediction model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). SimVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets without relying on additional tricks or complex strategies. Its simplicity makes it a useful baseline model for further research and provides valuable insights into video prediction.
