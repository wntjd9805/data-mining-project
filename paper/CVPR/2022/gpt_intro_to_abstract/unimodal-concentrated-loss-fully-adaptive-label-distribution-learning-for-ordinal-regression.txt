Ordinal regression is an important problem in computer science where labels are related in a natural or implied order. It has various applications such as facial age estimation and movie ratings. Early methods based on classification or regression performed poorly due to ignoring the ordinal relationship and label ambiguity. Ranking-based methods were proposed to address the ordinal relationship but still did not consider label ambiguity. Label distribution learning (LDL) was then introduced to convert a single label to a distribution, but fixed form LDL approaches limited their expression ability. To overcome this limitation, adaptive label distribution learning (ALDL) was proposed. However, existing ALDL methods still had limitations in fully exploiting the properties of ordinal regression. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive label distribution learning approach equipped with a unimodal-concentrated loss. This approach satisfies three principles for ordinal regression: 1) the highest probability corresponds to the ground-truth, 2) the distribution should be unimodal, and 3) the distribution should be adaptive to individual instances. We introduce a new unimodal-concentrated loss that can be easily embedded into existing CNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to existing methods.
