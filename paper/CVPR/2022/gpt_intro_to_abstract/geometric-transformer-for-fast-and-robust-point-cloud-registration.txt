Point cloud registration is an essential task in graphics, vision, and robotics that involves aligning two partially overlapping 3D point clouds by estimating a rigid transformation. Recent advances in 3D point representation learning and differentiable optimization have sparked renewed interest in this problem. Correspondence-based methods, particularly those using neural networks, have dominated recent research in point cloud registration. These methods rely on learning to extract point correspondences between input point clouds and calculating an alignment transformation using a robust estimator like RANSAC. However, detecting repeatable keypoints across small overlapping areas of point clouds is challenging, resulting in low inlier ratios in correspondence-based methods. Inspired by advances in image matching, keypoint-free methods downsample the input point clouds into superpoints and match them based on local patch overlapping. The accuracy of dense point correspondences depends heavily on the quality of superpoint matches. Vanilla transformation-based methods overlook the geometric structure of point clouds, leading to less discriminative features and many outlier matches. To address this, the authors propose a method called GeoTransformer. GeoTransformer encodes the geometric structure of point clouds by leveraging distances between point pairs and angles in point triplets. Self-attention is used to weigh the importance of anchor superpoints, leading to robust superpoint matching even in low-overlap scenarios. An overlap-aware circle loss is introduced to make GeoTransformer focus on superpoint pairs with higher patch overlap, improving convergence. The method achieves high inlier ratios in both superpoint and dense point correspondences and runs significantly faster than RANSAC. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoTransformer, with improvements in inlier ratio and registration recall. The main contributions of this paper are a fast and accurate keypoint-free and RANSAC-free point cloud registration method, a geometric transformer for learning transformation-invariant geometric representation, and an overlap-aware circle loss for better convergence.
