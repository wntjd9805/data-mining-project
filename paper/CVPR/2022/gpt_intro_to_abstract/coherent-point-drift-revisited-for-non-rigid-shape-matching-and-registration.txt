Non-rigid shape matching is a key component in computer vision and graphics applications. Unlike rigid shape matching, non-rigid shape matching is challenging due to its inability to be accurately modeled by a small number of parameters. Consequently, intrinsic methods, which rely on the intrinsic properties or features of shapes, have received more attention in the literature. These methods exploit spectral quantities using eigen-decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and have been successful in finding well-defined feature spaces to establish correspondences or maps. However, they suffer from issues such as discontinuity, lack of smoothness, and loss of information.Extrinsic methods, on the other hand, have the potential to preserve desired properties of maps and achieve more accurate alignment by operating in the ambient space. However, extrinsic methods have been less explored due to obstacles such as the difficulty of modeling high-degree-of-freedom deformations and the susceptibility to getting stuck in local optima during optimization.In this paper, we propose a generalized extrinsic method for non-rigid shape matching. Our method builds upon the classic coherent point drift (CPD) framework, addressing its weaknesses and limitations. We generalize the deformation model of CPD to handle non-Euclidean shapes and provide an alternative expression for the model. Additionally, we incorporate ideas from image matching tasks to handle the large search space problem inherent in shape matching. We generalize the probabilistic model of CPD to effectively handle outlier-contaminated initial correspondence sets using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) method.The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, we propose a generalized framework for non-rigid shape matching in non-Euclidean domains. Second, we present a generalized probabilistic model to handle outlier-contaminated correspondence sets. Third, we validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on multiple datasets.Overall, our method offers a novel approach to non-rigid shape matching that leverages both intrinsic and extrinsic information, resulting in improved matching accuracy and robustness.
