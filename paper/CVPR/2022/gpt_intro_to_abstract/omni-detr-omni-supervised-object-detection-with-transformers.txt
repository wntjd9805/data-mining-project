The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the challenges and costs associated with obtaining complete and accurate object detection annotations for large-scale datasets. It explores the concept of using weaker forms of object annotation, such as points, tags, and counts, as an alternative to expensive complete annotations. The paper introduces Omni-DETR, a unified architecture that can work with different types of weak annotations and leverage recent advancements in semi-supervised object detection. The proposed architecture filters teacher predictions using weak ground truth labels to generate pseudo labels for the student to learn. The paper demonstrates that weak annotations can improve detection performance and achieve a better cost-accuracy trade-off. It also explores the idea of using a mixture of weak and complete annotations to achieve better results compared to using only complete annotations. The paper suggests that the optimal mixture of annotations depends on the characteristics of the dataset. The contributions of the paper include the Omni-DETR framework, a novel pseudo label filtering strategy, experimental findings showing the benefits of weak annotations, and an exploration of optimal annotation mixtures.
