Forecasting trajectories of surrounding agents in autonomous driving is a challenging problem, especially in multi-mode traffic scenes with uncertain future possibilities. Early methods only learned deterministic trajectories, leading to output averaging in multi-mode scenes or mode collapse. Probabilistic approaches were proposed to generate multi-modal outputs by modeling diverse trajectories with a probability distribution. However, these methods suffered from poor interpretability and a heavy dependence on predefined distributions.To address the multi-modality problem, proposal-based methods decouple the trajectory prediction problem into intention prediction and motion prediction. However, existing methods had limitations such as inability to reuse proposals for other predictable agents and difficulty in modeling fine-grained intentions. It is crucial to choose proposals that accurately model intentions and can be shared among all agents.Additionally, selecting representative trajectories is essential. Traditional methods use Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm with a fixed threshold, but this cannot balance accuracy and variety. Some methods attempt to output multiple trajectories through optimization-based methods, resulting in a complicated workflow and increased computation cost.This paper proposes a Lane-based Trajectory Prediction (LTP) method that uses lane segments as proposals for intention modeling. Lane segments have advantages, including explicitly representing fine-grained intentions, capturing interaction with agents, and enabling sharing among agents. Our method predicts the future destination and regresses the corresponding trajectory based on these lane-based proposals. We also propose a variance-based NMS algorithm that dynamically adjusts the threshold to achieve the balance of accuracy and diversity.The contributions of this paper include the proposed LTP method with explicit intention modeling, the novel variance-based NMS algorithm, and the outperformance of our method on the Argoverse forecasting benchmark. We also demonstrate the reliable performance of LTP as a planner in closed-loop simulation.
