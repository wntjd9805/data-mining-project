Structured light (SL) 3D imaging systems have inherent tradeoffs between precision and acquisition time. Different SL techniques achieve varying depth resolutions and capture speeds, but often sacrifice one for the other. When operating in challenging scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), longer temporal codes can offer robustness and precision but at the expense of acquisition speed. This paper introduces Single-Photon Structured Light systems based on Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs), which can operate at high speeds without being affected by read noise. SPADs detect photon arrivals, allowing for binary-valued measurements that are sufficient for a family of SL coding schemes. High-speed projectors using digital micromirror devices (DMDs) further complement SPADs for SL applications. To address photon noise, the paper formulates novel SL encoding strategies using error-correction codes and hierarchical codes that consider practical effects like projector and camera defocus. The proposed system demonstrates high-speed scanning, sub-millimeter precise depth imaging, and the reconstruction of low-albedo objects. While Single-Photon SL has great potential, it still faces limitations such as addressing long-range effects and improving SPAD technology. The advancements in single-photon sensors may overcome these limitations with higher resolution arrays and increased fill factors in the future.
