This paper introduces the concept of image restoration (IR), which aims to recover high-quality images from degraded measurements. The degradation process is represented by a matrix and additive noise. IR can be categorized into subtasks such as denoising, deblurring, deraining, and compressive sensing. In recent years, three main research topics have emerged in IR: model-based methods, deep learning methods, and hybrid methods. Model-based methods approach IR as a Bayesian problem, using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework to solve the restoration equation. These methods employ an energy function that combines a data fidelity term and a regularization term. The data fidelity term ensures the solution aligns with the degradation, while the regularization term addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem by incorporating desired properties. However, handcrafted design limits the representation ability of these methods and they tend to be time-consuming.Deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in IR by learning strong priors from large-scale datasets. Various function units and architectures have been proposed to enhance performance. However, the black box nature of deep learning models makes it difficult to analyze the role of different components, and performance gains often come with increased model complexity.Hybrid methods aim to combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the adaptivity of deep learning. One approach is deep plug-and-play (PNP) methods, which integrate pre-trained CNN denoisers into iterative optimization frameworks for different IR tasks. Another approach is deep unfolding networks (DUN), which optimize all parameters end-to-end. However, most DUN methods require known degradation processes or handcrafted assumptions, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios.To address these issues, this paper introduces a deep generalized unfolding network (DGUNet). DGUNet combines the interpretability of model-based methods with the end-to-end training and feature pathway of deep learning methods. It integrates a gradient estimation strategy into the Proximal Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm to handle degradation-unknown cases. Inter-stage information pathways are designed to compensate for the information loss in DUN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DGUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in various IR tasks, with attractive complexity.
