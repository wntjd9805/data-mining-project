The performance of deep object detection networks heavily relies on the size of the labeled dataset. However, labeling more data comes at a cost. Therefore, it is important to utilize active learning strategies to select the most informative samples for labeling, as well as self and semi-supervised learning approaches to leverage unlabeled data.Current consistency-based semi-supervised learning methods for object detection aim to minimize inconsistencies in network predictions. However, there are still cases where inconsistent predictions occur, hindering learning. Auto-labeling, which uses self-learning to label high-confident predictions, can also generate wrong labels and neglect low-performing classes.In situations where samples cannot be pseudo-labeled, manual labeling is an alternative. Active learning is commonly used to select promising samples for labeling, based on an acquisition function that assesses the informativeness of an image using network uncertainty. However, the acquisition function may not be effective if the network is not well-trained, especially early in the active learning cycles. In addition, changing the dataset distribution at each cycle can impact performance.This research proposes a holistic approach to the labeling problem, combining manual labeling and auto-labeling. It introduces the concept of robustness to the acquisition function, ensuring consistent predictions between an image and its augmentations. This allows for the selection of informative samples from both low and high-performing classes. Auto-labeling is used to reduce labeling costs by leveraging easy samples, not typically used in active learning cycles.The contributions of this work include a novel class-agnostic active learning score based on network robustness, the use of auto-labeling to expand the labeled dataset, and experimental results demonstrating improved performance on the PASCAL VOC07+12 and MS-COCO datasets. Compared to existing methods, this approach achieves up to a 7.7% and 7% relative mean average precision improvement for PASCAL-VOC and MS-COCO, respectively, while reducing labeling costs by up to 82%.
