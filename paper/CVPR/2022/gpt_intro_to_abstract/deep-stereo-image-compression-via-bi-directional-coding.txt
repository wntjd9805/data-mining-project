Abstract:Stereoscopic imaging technologies have gained significant momentum in various applications such as augmented reality, autonomous driving, and robot navigation. To efficiently handle the compression of stereo images, different methods have been developed to reduce both intra-view and inter-view redundancies. Traditional approaches rely on inter-view prediction techniques like disparity compensation prediction (DCP) but struggle to handle complex inter-view correlations effectively. With the emergence of deep learning, single image compression methods have shown promising results and provided insights for stereo image compression. However, existing methods mainly employ a unidirectional coding mechanism, limiting their effectiveness and scalability for reducing inter-view redundancy. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an end-to-end stereo image compression network based on bi-directional coding (BCSIC-Net). The proposed approach extends the existing unidirectional coding mechanism to a bi-directional one, allowing for more effective reduction of inter-view redundancy and bitrate savings. This is achieved through the introduction of a bi-directional contextual transform module (Bi-CTM) and a bi-directional conditional entropy model (Bi-CEM). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BCSIC-Net achieves higher reconstruction quality with lower bit consumption compared to the state-of-the-art unidirectional methods. The paper's contributions include: 1) Proposing a novel end-to-end stereo image compression network based on bi-directional coding (BCSIC-Net) to effectively exploit inter-view correlations for better compression performance. 2) Introducing a bi-directional contextual transform module (Bi-CTM) to reduce redundancy between stereo views through conditioned nonlinear transforms. 3) Developing a bi-directional conditional entropy model (Bi-CEM) to enhance entropy coding efficiency by leveraging inter-view correspondence as a conditional prior. 4) Evaluating the proposed method on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art coding performance.Section II presents related works on single image compression and stereo image compression. The proposed method is described in detail in Section III, followed by experimental results and analysis in Section IV. The paper concludes in Section V.
