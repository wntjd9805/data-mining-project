Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, with applications in various security-critical systems. Adversarial patch attacks, where a region of an image is distorted, pose a serious threat to object detection systems. Existing defenses against patch attacks are limited to image classification and do not address the complexity of object detection. In this paper, we propose Segment and Complete (SAC), a defense strategy that can robustify any object detector against patch attacks without retraining. SAC adopts a "detect and remove" strategy, where adversarial patches are detected and masked before being fed into the object detector. We observe that adversarial patches can affect predictions not just locally, but also on objects farther away in the image due to spatial context reasoning. SAC robustly detects adversarial patches by training a patch segmenter and employing a self-adversarial training algorithm. We also propose a robust shape completion algorithm to ensure accurate detection. SAC achieves a 45.0% mean average precision (mAP) under patch attacks, providing a 30.6% mAP gain compared to the undefended model while maintaining the same 49.0% clean mAP on the COCO dataset. To facilitate research in physical patch attacks, we create the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which includes pixel-level annotations of physical adversarial patches. SAC effectively reduces the patch attack success rate from 7.97% to 2.17%. Our contributions include the introduction of SAC as a general method for defending object detectors against patch attacks, its evaluation on both digital and physical attacks, and the provision of the APRICOT-Mask dataset. SAC demonstrates superior robustness under non-adaptive and adaptive attacks and generalizes well to unseen shapes, attack budgets, and methods.
