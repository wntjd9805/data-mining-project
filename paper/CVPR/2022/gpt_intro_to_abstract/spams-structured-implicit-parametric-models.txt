Understanding non-rigidly deforming shapes is crucial for perception in our 4D world. While significant progress has been made in 4D reconstruction and tracking, existing methods have limitations in terms of complexity and expressability. Parametric 3D models have been effective for modeling domain-specific deformable objects but require a complex construction process. Learned continuous implicit representations have shown promise for capturing effective static 3D shape geometry. However, these approaches characterize objects as a whole, lacking structured correlation on a lower-level part basis. In this paper, we propose Structured-implicit PArametric Models (SPAMs) that learn a structured, part-based representation of deformable 3D objects. SPAMs leverage continuous implicit function representations for each part's geometry and motion. At test time, the learned latent part spaces are traversed to fit new depth sequences, establishing global correspondences using predicted part segmentation. Experimental results on non-rigid tracking and reconstruction show that SPAMs outperform state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this work include learning a part-based disentanglement of shape and pose and enabling part-based reasoning to guide joint optimization for robust non-rigid reconstruction and tracking.
