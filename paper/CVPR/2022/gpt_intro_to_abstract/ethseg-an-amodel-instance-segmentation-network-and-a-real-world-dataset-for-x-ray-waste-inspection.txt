Abstract:The increasing amount of waste produced globally poses significant challenges for waste disposal and proper waste management. Improper waste disposal can have irreversible consequences for the environment, including climate warming, soil contamination, and marine pollution. Therefore, it is crucial to develop effective solutions for waste inspection and disposal. Traditional methods of waste inspection rely on manual labor, which is inefficient and poses health risks to workers. Computer vision methods, such as object detection using RGB images, have been proposed to improve efficiency and reduce human contact with harmful waste. However, these methods often require garbage bags to be opened and waste items to be well-spread, which adds costly preparation procedures and fails to identify heavily occluded waste items.In this paper, we propose the use of X-ray scanning for waste inspection. X-rays have strong penetrating power, allowing even occluded or buried objects to be well-imaged. Compared to natural images, X-ray images have distinct characteristics such as color indicating thickness and material type, as well as well-preserved edge information. These characteristics make it possible to inspect all waste items in packaged waste without opening the bag. We introduce the problem of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray images to enable intelligent waste inspection. Unlike existing methods that focus on security inspection, our approach aims to predict waste category and pixel-level masks to facilitate fine-grained inspection.To address the lack of available datasets, we contribute the Waste Inspection X-ray Dataset (WIXray), which consists of high-quality annotated X-ray images collected from a campus community. The dataset contains 12 waste categories, and each image has an average of 6.13 labeled instances. Existing methods designed for natural images do not perform well on X-ray images due to the imaging mechanism's differences. Therefore, we propose an Easy-to-Hard Instance Segmentation Network (ETHSeg) specifically designed for X-ray waste inspection. ETHSeg employs an easy-to-hard disassembling strategy to handle highly overlapped regions and incorporates a global structure guidance module for better contour information capture.Our contributions include the introduction of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray images, the provision of the WIXray dataset as a benchmark, and the development of the ETHSeg method for accurate mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in X-ray waste instance segmentation.
