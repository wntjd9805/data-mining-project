The development of deep learning has greatly improved the performance of semantic segmentation tasks. However, existing frameworks are unable to handle unseen classes in new applications without sufficient fully-labeled data, and fine-tuning costs additional time and resources. To address this, few-shot segmentation (FS-Seg) models are trained on well-labeled base classes and tested on previously unseen novel classes. However, FS-Seg requires support samples to contain classes that exist in query samples, which can be burdensome and limits its practicality. Additionally, FS-Seg only evaluates novel classes, disregarding the base classes present in test samples. To overcome these limitations, we propose Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFS-Seg), which does not require support samples with the same target classes as query samples during evaluation. GFS-Seg consists of three phases: base class learning, novel class registration, and evaluation on both base and novel classes. Inspired by previous work, we design Context-Aware Prototype Learning (CAPL), which updates the weights of base prototypes with adapted features, leveraging contextual relations and improving performance. CAPL can be applied to various semantic segmentation models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the setting of FS-Seg. Our contributions include extending FS-Seg to GFS-Seg, analyzing the performance gap between the two approaches, and proposing CAPL to enhance segmentation models in both settings. GFS-Seg and CAPL provide a practical solution for semantic segmentation in challenging situations where only limited labeled data is available for novel classes.
