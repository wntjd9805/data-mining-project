In computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, object tracking, and pose estimation, the partitioning of weighted graphs has been successfully utilized. Many existing graph clustering methods work with positive edge weights only, which require the user to specify the desired number of clusters or termination criteria. On the other hand, signed graphs with both positive and negative edge weights offer the advantage of balancing attraction and repulsion without the need for additional parameters. The multicut or correlation clustering problem is a well-known formulation of the signed graph partitioning problem, which is NP-hard but can be approximately solved using greedy agglomerative clustering algorithms. However, there is a lack of overarching studies comparing the robustness and efficiency of these algorithms or providing guidelines for selecting the appropriate algorithm for a given partitioning problem.This paper presents a simple theoretical framework that generalizes agglomerative algorithms for signed graphs by linking them to hierarchical clustering on unsigned graphs. The framework allows for exploring different combinations of linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints. Some of these combinations correspond to existing clustering algorithms, while others introduce new algorithms. The theoretical properties of these algorithms, including their ability to define an ultrametric on the graph, are analyzed. The algorithms are evaluated on various existing and synthetically generated signed graph clustering problems.In addition, the algorithms are tested on instance segmentation, a computer vision task involving the partitioning of graphs estimated by a CNN. The choice of linkage criterion is shown to significantly affect cluster growth dynamics, making certain linkage methods more suitable for specific clustering problems. The efficiency, robustness, and tendency to over- or under-cluster of the algorithms are benchmarked. The agglomerative algorithms outperform spectral clustering methods on instance segmentation, with average-linkage based algorithms achieving state-of-the-art results on the CREMI 2016 challenge for neuron segmentation.Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive study of agglomerative algorithms for signed graph partitioning, proposing new algorithms and evaluating their performance on various clustering problems. The findings contribute to the understanding of these algorithms and provide practical insights for selecting appropriate methods in different applications.
