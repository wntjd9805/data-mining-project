Understanding animal behavior and movement in the wild is crucial for a variety of applications, including conservation efforts and wildlife management. Monitoring animals through video cameras allows researchers to gather information on their behaviors and detect movement-related injuries without interfering with their natural behaviors. Animal behavioral analysis has also helped in fields such as pharmaceutical science, neuroscience, robotics, animation, and game development. However, analyzing animal behaviors can be labor-intensive and time-consuming due to the vast volume of wildlife footage. Existing animal behavioral analysis datasets have limitations, including small size, limited diversity of animals, uniform environmental conditions, and limited annotations for comprehensive analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce the Animal Kingdom dataset, a diverse dataset for animal behavioral analysis. Additionally, we propose a Collaborative Action Recognition (CARe) model for action recognition with unseen animal types. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of animal behaviors and their implications for a wide range of applications.
