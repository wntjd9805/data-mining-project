Estimating the pose (position and orientation) of 3D objects from a single RGB image is a crucial task in computer vision. This paper introduces the concept of EPro-PnP, a probabilistic Perspective-n-Points (PnP) approach, that enables end-to-end learning of 2D-3D correspondences for pose estimation. Existing methods in this field are biased towards specific tasks, such as 6DoF pose estimation for robot manipulation or 3D object detection for autonomous driving. The proposed EPro-PnP approach overcomes limitations of existing differentiable PnP methods by learning the entire set of points and weights in an end-to-end manner. The non-differentiable nature of deterministic pose estimation is addressed by interpreting the output of PnP as a probabilistic distribution parameterized by the learnable 2D-3D correspondences. During training, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the predicted and target pose distributions is used as the loss function. The proposed EPro-PnP approach unifies existing correspondence learning techniques and can easily achieve top-tier performance for 6DoF pose estimation. Additionally, the flexibility of EPro-PnP is demonstrated through deformable correspondence learning for accurate 3D object detection. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach for end-to-end pose estimation by learning 2D-3D correspondences, leading to improved performance and flexibility in various computer vision tasks.
