This paper discusses the recognition of vector graphics (VG) in the context of deep learning-based visual perception systems. While most current methods focus on sensory input in the form of raster graphics (RG), VG presents a unique challenge due to its parametric equations and the need for rasterization to convert it into RG format. Existing VG recognizers typically rely on rendered RG as input, but this approach sacrifices the structural information and high-resolution properties of VG. Recent efforts have explored direct recognition of VG, but these methods are prone to human-unperceivable topological errors. This paper proposes a novel method that combines the strengths of both VG and RG for more effective recognition. The specific approach to fusing VG and RG information is a topic of further investigation.
