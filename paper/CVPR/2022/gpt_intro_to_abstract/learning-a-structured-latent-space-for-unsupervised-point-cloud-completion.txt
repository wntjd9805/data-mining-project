Point cloud completion is an important task in computer science that involves estimating a complete point cloud based on partial point cloud data. This task has applications in shape classification, robotics navigation, and scene understanding. While fully supervised methods have achieved impressive results, they rely on large-scale paired partial-complete data which is difficult to collect. Alternatively, unpaired learning methods have been proposed, but they face challenges in the absence of paired and accurate point-wise supervision. This paper proposes a unified and structured latent space approach for encoding both partial and complete shapes, allowing for strong supervisions in unsupervised point cloud completion. The proposed method models occlusion in the latent space and utilizes ranking constraints to improve geometric consistency and shape completion accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on both synthetic and real datasets. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a unified and structured latent space, the use of constraints for related partial point clouds, and the demonstration of superior performance in unsupervised point cloud completion.
