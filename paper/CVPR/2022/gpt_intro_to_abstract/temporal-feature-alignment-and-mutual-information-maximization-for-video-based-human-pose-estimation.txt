A key component of human interaction lies in our ability to recognize poses, making pose estimation crucial for intelligent machines. While there is extensive literature on pose estimation in static images, handling videos with fast motion and pose occlusion remains a challenge. Existing methods either aggregate sequential features from neighboring frames or employ optical flow to refine pose estimation. However, these methods suffer from performance deterioration in challenging scenarios. This paper proposes a novel framework called FAMI-Pose that addresses these challenges. FAMI-Pose conducts coarse-to-fine deformations to align neighboring frames at the feature level and incorporates an information-theoretic objective as intermediate supervision. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of FAMI-Pose over state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this work include the examination of multi-frame human pose estimation, the introduction of an information-theoretic loss function, and the achievement of new state-of-the-art results.
