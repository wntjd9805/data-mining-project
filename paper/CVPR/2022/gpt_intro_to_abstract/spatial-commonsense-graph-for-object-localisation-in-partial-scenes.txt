The localisation of unobserved objects in partial scenes is a fundamental task with applications in automation, such as assisting visually impaired individuals and layout proposal for interior design. Despite its practical importance, object localisation in partial scenes has not been formally studied. This paper introduces a novel approach to solve this problem by treating it as an edge prediction task using a Spatial Commonsense Graph (SCG) representation. The SCG integrates spatial knowledge from the scene and commonsense knowledge from an external knowledge base. By injecting commonsense knowledge into the graph, a machine can infer the whereabouts of an object even without visual/depth information. The proposed SCG is constructed by connecting nodes representing known objects in the scene based on their spatial proximity and adding nodes representing concepts connected by relevant commonsense relationships. The SCG Object Localiser (SCG-OL) is a two-stage solution that predicts pairwise proximity between the target object and known objects using a Proximity Prediction Network (PPN), and computes the object's position based on these distances using a Localisation Module. The proposed approach is evaluated on a new dataset constructed from partial reconstructions of real-world indoor scenes. The results show that the SCG-OL achieves the best performance compared to other methods. The contributions of this work include the identification of the object localisation task in partial scenes, the introduction of the SCG representation, and the development of the SCG-OL solution that is agnostic to scene coordinates.
