Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, snow, and adherent raindrop can significantly reduce image visibility and hinder the performance of high-level vision applications. In recent years, various algorithms have been developed to address this problem, including deraining, desnowing, dehazing, and all-in-one bad weather removal. While these algorithms have shown promise, their deployment in real-world applications is limited due to high extension costs. Existing approaches generally focus on a specific type of weather or require separate pre-trained weights for different weather types. This makes it challenging to handle multiple weather types simultaneously.In this paper, we propose a novel method for comprehensive bad weather removal using a two-stage knowledge learning process. In the first stage, well-trained teacher models guide an "immature" student model to integrate and learn knowledge from various weather types. Our proposed collaborative knowledge transfer technique ensures effective knowledge transfer through progressive feature projection and bi-directional feature matching. This process facilitates the learning of common features across multiple adverse weather removal networks. In the second stage, the "mature" student network is examined with challenging constraints to improve its robustness. We introduce multi-contrastive regularization to optimize the student network and enhance its discriminative ability for different weather types.The contributions of this paper include the development of a comprehensive bad weather removal method based on two-stage knowledge learning. Our approach enables the network to handle different weather removal problems with a unified architecture and a single set of pre-trained parameters. Additionally, we design the collaborative knowledge transfer and multi-contrastive regularization techniques to enhance the performance of our training scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in simultaneously handling multiple adverse weather types.Overall, our proposed method provides a promising approach for comprehensive bad weather removal, addressing the limitations of existing algorithms and enabling their deployment in real-world scenarios without incurring additional costs.
