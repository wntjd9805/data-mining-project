Self-supervised learning is crucial in computer vision for learning powerful spatio-temporal representations using unlabelled videos. However, most current approaches are based on contrastive learning with manually trimmed videos, which is labor-intensive and may introduce human bias. This paper proposes a novel framework called HiCo for Hierarchical Consistency learning that exploits hierarchical consistencies in untrimmed videos, namely visual consistency and topical consistency. HiCo includes two hierarchical tasks: visually consistent learning, which applies standard contrastive learning on clips with small temporal distance; and topical consistency learning, which uses a topic prediction task to group different topics. The paper also introduces gradual sampling to increase training difficulty for positive pairs, improving optimization and generalization. Experimental results show that HiCo achieves strong and generalized video representations from untrimmed videos, outperforming standard contrastive learning on downstream action recognition tasks by 12.8% and 12.5% on HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, respectively. HiCo also demonstrates improved performance on trimmed videos.
