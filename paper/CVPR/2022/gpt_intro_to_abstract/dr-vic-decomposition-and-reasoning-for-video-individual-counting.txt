Abstract:The rapid growth of the world population and urbanization has led to significant challenges in city management, particularly in areas such as transport management, public space design, evacuation planning, and public safety. Accurately estimating the number of pedestrians in a given region and time period is crucial for addressing these challenges. This paper focuses on the task of Video Individual Counting (VIC), which aims to count the total number of pedestrians with separate identities in a given video. Existing image-level crowd counting and cross-line counting methods are not suitable for VIC due to issues such as over-counting and manual annotation requirements. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new framework called Decomposition and Reasoning Network (DRNet) that decomposes pedestrians into initial pedestrians and new pedestrians in successive frames. DRNet utilizes neural networks and differentiable optimal transport to efficiently predict inflow and outflow of pedestrians between adjacent frames, achieving accurate video individual counting. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework over strong baselines, making it a valuable contribution to the field of crowd counting in computer vision.
