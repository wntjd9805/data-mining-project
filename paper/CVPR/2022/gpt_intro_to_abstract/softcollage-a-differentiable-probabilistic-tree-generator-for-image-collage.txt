Image collage is a popular technique for creating visually appealing visual summaries of a group of images. As amateurs often lack the expertise for manual collage creation, there is a high demand for automatic image collage tools. Many research efforts have focused on automating the image collage process, but existing methods have encountered challenges such as image artifacts and overlapping. To address these issues, tree-based algorithms have been developed to better preserve image content. These algorithms encode the collage as a binary tree, with each leaf node representing an image and each interior node representing a bounding box. However, existing approaches rely on heuristic hand-crafted adjustment rules for optimizing the tree structure, limiting their ability to fully explore the collage space. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages deep learning to generate a high-quality collage tree in a differentiable manner. We introduce a deep neural-based probabilistic tree generator that constructs a "soft" probabilistic tree structure based on image features, aspect ratio, and canvas size. We also formulate the optimization of the tree structure as an end-to-end framework using policy gradients, enabling efficient exploration of the optimal collage structure. Furthermore, we contribute a large-scale annotated dataset, AIC, for quantitative evaluation of image collage methods. Experimental results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
