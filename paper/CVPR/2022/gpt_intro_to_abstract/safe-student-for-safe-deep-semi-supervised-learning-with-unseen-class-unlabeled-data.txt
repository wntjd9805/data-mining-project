The recent success of deep learning methods is attributed to advancements in learning algorithms and the availability of large-scale labeled data. However, collecting large-scale annotated data is difficult and expensive, leading to a growing interest in semi-supervised learning (SSL) which utilizes plentiful and cheap unlabeled data. Deep SSL methods can enhance learning model performance but require the unlabeled and labeled datasets to have the same distribution. Real-world scenarios often involve unlabeled data with unseen-class instances, which significantly degrade SSL performance. This paper addresses the problem of Safe Deep semi-supervised learning with Unseen-class unlabeled data (SDU), which is rarely considered in the literature. One approach is to detect and remove unseen-class instances using identification methods, but this is limited by a small number of labeled data. Several deep safe SSL methods have been proposed to address this limitation by selecting reliable seen-class instances from unlabeled data. However, these methods are inaccurate due to limited identification ability and the lack of suitable data. This paper aims to propose a novel approach to address the SDU problem and improve the performance of safe SSL methods.
