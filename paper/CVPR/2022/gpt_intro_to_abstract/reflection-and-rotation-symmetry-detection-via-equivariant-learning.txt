This paper focuses on the detection of reflection and rotation symmetries, which are two of the most fundamental symmetries. The goal is to find the reflection axis and rotation center that remain invariant under these symmetries. While previous methods have been limited to well-defined symmetry patterns, this paper aims to explore the detection of real-world symmetries. Early approaches utilized keypoint pairs and hand-crafted feature descriptors, while recent methods have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn score map regression or symmetric matching. One of the main challenges in symmetry detection is the arbitrary orientation of symmetries, which requires analysis based on orientation. Methods typically involve searching over the space of candidate orientations and developing a robust representation that is either invariant or equivariant with respect to rotation and reflection. Early approaches used oriented keypoints and orientation normalization, but these techniques are not applicable to deep feature maps from standard neural networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes EquiSym, a group-equivariant CNN for symmetry detection. Group-equivariant networks are designed to preserve structure with respect to geometric transformations, making them well-suited for symmetry detection. EquiSym is capable of detecting consistent symmetry patterns over different orientations by building a dihedrally-equivariant convolutional network. Additionally, the paper introduces a new dataset called DENse and DIverse symmetry (DENDI) for reflection and rotation symmetry detection. DENDI contains real-world images with accurate annotations, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by including diverse reflection axes and rotation centers in various scales and orientations. It also annotates the number of rotation folds, which is a first in a large-scale dataset. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: the proposal of EquiSym, a novel group-equivariant symmetry detection network; the introduction of the DENDI dataset; and the demonstration of EquiSym's outstanding performance in reflection symmetry detection on various benchmarks, as well as rotation symmetry detection on DENDI.
