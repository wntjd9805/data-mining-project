Competitive sports video understanding is a popular topic in computer vision research, with Action Quality Assessment (AQA) gaining attention. AQA aims to assess the performance of sports actions by estimating a score. Traditional methods rely on deep features of videos to learn scores, but this approach is difficult for actions with subtle differences in similar backgrounds. Diving events, for example, have similar routines with differences in somersaults, twists, flight positions, and executed qualities. To address this challenge, the researchers propose a new fine-grained sports video dataset called "FineDiving" that includes semantic labels, temporal boundaries, and official scores. They also introduce a procedure-aware approach for AQA, using a Temporal Segmentation Attention module (TSA) to predict scores with interpretability. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results. This work contributes to the field by providing a fine-grained dataset and a procedure-aware approach for assessing action quality in sports videos.
