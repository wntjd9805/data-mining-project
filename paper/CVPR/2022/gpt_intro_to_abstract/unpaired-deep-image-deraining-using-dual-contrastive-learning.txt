Images captured in rainy weather conditions often suffer from poor visibility due to rain streaks. This degradation in image quality can significantly affect various computer vision tasks, leading to a drop in performance. Therefore, there is a need for an effective algorithm to recover high-quality rain-free images.In this paper, we address the problem of single image de-raining (SID) by estimating the clean image from the input rainy image. The rain process is typically modeled using a linear superimposition model, where the rainy image is the sum of the clean image and the rain streaks. This is an ill-posed problem as only the rainy image is known. Conventional methods impose certain priors on the clean images and rain components, but these priors may not effectively remove the rain.Data-driven learning methods have shown remarkable performance in SID, but fully-supervised methods require paired synthetic data that may not accurately model real-world degradation. Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methods have been proposed to address this issue but often fail to restore high-quality derained results.To overcome these challenges, we propose the Dual Contrastive Derain-GAN (DCD-GAN) method that combines contrastive learning with an adversarial framework. The DCD-GAN explores useful features from the rainy images and unpaired clean images to facilitate rain removal. It incorporates a Bidi-rectional Translation Branch (BTB) and a Contrastive Guidance Branch (CGB). The BTB uses bidirectional mapping to extract rain-related or clean-cue features, while the CGB constrains the latent space to guide deraining through contrastive learning.Our contributions include formulating an effective DCD-GAN that leverages dual contrastive learning in the deep feature space, performing rain removal without paired training information, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets.In conclusion, our proposed DCD-GAN method effectively removes rain streaks from images captured in rainy weather conditions. It utilizes contrastive learning to explore mutual features and distinguish dissimilar ones between the rainy and rain-free domains. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing unpaired deraining approaches and its comparability to fully-supervised and semi-supervised models.
