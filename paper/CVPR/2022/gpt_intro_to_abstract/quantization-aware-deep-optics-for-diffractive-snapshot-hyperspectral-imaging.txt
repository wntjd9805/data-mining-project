Snapshot hyperspectral imaging has become popular for capturing hyperspectral images of dynamic scenes. Conventional systems require multiple sensor exposures, making them unsuitable for measuring dynamic scenes. To overcome this limitation, diffractive snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems have been developed, replacing optical elements with a thin diffractive optical element (DOE). Previous methods designed the DOE height map based on hand-crafted knowledge, but did not consider the physical quantization in DOE fabrication. This paper proposes a quantization-aware deep optics (QDO) model for diffractive snapshot hyperspectral imaging. The proposed model explicitly models the quantization operation during the DOE height map optimization, bridging the gap between optimization and fabrication. An adaptive quantization-aware mechanism is also proposed to adjust the physical height of each quantization level during DOE height map optimization. The fabricated DOE and the reconstruction algorithm are systematically matched, improving the practicality of the deep optics framework. Extensive simulations and real hardware experiments confirm the superior performance of the proposed method. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of a quantization-aware deep optics model, an adaptive mechanism for DOE height map optimization, and the fabrication of a quantized DOE for diffractive snapshot hyperspectral imaging.
