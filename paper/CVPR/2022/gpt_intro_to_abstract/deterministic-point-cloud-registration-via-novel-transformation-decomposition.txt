Rigid point cloud registration, the process of aligning two 3D point clouds using an unknown transformation, is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods for point cloud registration can be categorized into two groups based on whether they require correspondences between the 3D points. Methods that do not require correspondences often have low generality or efficiency. To overcome these limitations, some methods have been proposed that require putative correspondences, which can be easily obtained using descriptors. This paper focuses on cases where putative correspondences are known. The goal is to find the optimal 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) transformation that fits the largest number of inlier correspondences. Many existing methods search all 6 DOF simultaneously, but this approach is inefficient due to the high-dimensional search space. Other methods decompose the 6 DOF into rotation and translation, but they have limitations in terms of non-linearity or increased input size. This paper presents a new decomposition strategy that first computes 2 DOF of rotation and 1 DOF of translation, followed by the remaining 1 DOF of rotation and 2 DOF of translation. The proposed search strategy, based on branch and bound, provides tighter bounds and improves efficiency. The main contributions of this paper are a novel decomposition strategy that reduces the non-linearity of rotation and an efficient search strategy for parameter estimation. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art approaches and found to be more accurate and robust while maintaining efficiency.
