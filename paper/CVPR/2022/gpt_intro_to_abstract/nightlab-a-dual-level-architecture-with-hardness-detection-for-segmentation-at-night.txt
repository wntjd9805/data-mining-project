This computer science paper focuses on the task of semantic segmentation in computer vision, specifically in nighttime scenes. While there have been advancements in daytime semantic segmentation, limited progress has been made in nighttime segmentation, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotic vision. One challenge in nighttime segmentation is the lack of labeled nighttime images compared to daytime ones. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods for segmentation between daytime and nighttime scenes perform poorly due to the large domain gap. To address these challenges, the authors propose NightLab, a nighttime segmentation framework that leverages a large dataset of densely labeled nighttime images called NightCity. NightLab incorporates an exposure-guided layer to handle illumination variation and proposes two key modules: a regularized light adaptation module (ReLAM) to reduce light variation and preserve night image texture, and a hardness detection module (HDM) to identify regions that require additional attention and analysis. The authors demonstrate that NightLab outperforms concurrent methods on nighttime benchmarks and provide a more accurate benchmark dataset derived from NightCity. The contributions of this work include proposing NightLab with novel modules, developing an effective training pipeline, and providing a benchmark dataset and strong baseline for future research.
