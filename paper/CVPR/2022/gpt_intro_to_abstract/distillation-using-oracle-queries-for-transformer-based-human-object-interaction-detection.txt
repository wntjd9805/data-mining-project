This paper introduces Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, which aims to identify human, interaction, object triplets in an image. The paper addresses the challenges of HOI detection by utilizing transformer-based models and proposing two novel methods: Distillation using Oracle Queries (DOQ) and Context-Consistent Stitching (CCS). DOQ leverages a teacher-student framework where the teacher network generates high-quality representations and precise attention maps using oracle HOI queries and ground-truth information. The student network mimics the teacher network, benefiting from the precise semantic and position information. This approach significantly improves the representation learning ability and convergence rate of transformer-based HOI detection methods.CCS introduces an efficient data augmentation technique that synthesizes new images with multiple human-object pairs. By stitching together labeled pairs from similar training images, CCS creates visually realistic images without manual labeling. This augmentation strategy enhances the set prediction power of the transformer model.The proposed methods are evaluated on three HOI detection benchmarks and consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. The knowledge distillation based on oracle queries not only improves accuracy but also significantly accelerates the convergence rate compared to existing methods. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in overcoming challenges in HOI detection.
