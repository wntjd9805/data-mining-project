The paper introduces a framework for human motion analysis that combines description, synthesis, and editing tasks. The framework utilizes a hierarchical motion representation called Programmatic Motion Concepts (PMC), which learns high-level motion concepts from low-level input sequences of keypoints. PMC represents motion concepts as groups of consecutive motion primitives and allows for recognition, synthesis, and editing of human motion videos. The paper proposes a data-efficient learning algorithm that operates on time-space curves and leverages the repetition of motion concepts in videos. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the framework in various video analysis tasks. Overall, the contributions of the paper include the novel hierarchical representation, the data-efficient learning algorithm, and the demonstrated effectiveness in motion description, synthesis, and editing tasks.
