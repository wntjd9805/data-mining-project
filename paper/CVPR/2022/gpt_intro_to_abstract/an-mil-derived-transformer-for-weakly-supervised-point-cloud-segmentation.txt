This paper introduces a weakly supervised method for point cloud segmentation, which aims to identify semantic categories of points. The high annotation cost of training data poses a challenge for learning a segmentation model. To address this issue, existing methods use weak supervisory signals such as partially labeled points or scene-level annotations. However, these methods only utilize intra-cloud information. Inspired by image co-segmentation and cross-image pattern mining, this paper proposes a MIL-derived transformer model that explores inter-cloud semantics to supervise segmentation model training. The transformer is applied to paired point clouds, with one cloud serving as an anchor and the other as a reference. The model uses both intra-cloud and inter-cloud information to accomplish weakly supervised segmentation. An adaptive global weighted pooling technique is also proposed to address the class imbalance problem and the issues with max or average pooling. Additionally, cross-scale consistency of point clouds is considered to regularize weakly supervised feature extraction. The main contribution of this work is the MIL-derived transformer model, which utilizes inter-cloud semantics for weakly supervised segmentation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
