This paper introduces a task-agnostic vision-language architecture, GPV-1, which aims to develop a general purpose vision system capable of carrying out various vision tasks without the need for architecture modifications. The system takes in an image and a text description of a task and produces relevant bounding boxes, confidences, and text outputs. The proposed architecture allows users to query the system with different requests, such as visual question answering, localization, and image captioning, without prior knowledge of the system's architecture or training. The paper highlights the importance of general-purpose systems in computer vision and draws parallels with advancements in natural language processing. The authors propose evaluations to measure the generality of architecture, concepts across skills, and learning efficiency. The system is trained and evaluated on tasks such as visual question answering, captioning, object classification, and object localization, while also testing zero-shot generalization and fine-tuning. The contributions of the paper include the proposed task-agnostic architecture and the evaluation framework that tests its generality and learning abilities.
