This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of geospatial semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Geospatial semantic segmentation involves assigning a semantic category to each pixel in a remote sensing image. This task is crucial for various applications, including environmental assessment, infrastructure planning, and natural resources management.One of the main issues in geospatial semantic segmentation is the presence of large intra-class variance. In other words, pixels belonging to the same semantic category may exhibit significant differences in appearance. This can make it difficult to accurately assign the correct semantic category to each pixel.To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that leverages advanced deep learning techniques. Our approach takes into account both local and global spatial information in the remote sensing images to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation. Specifically, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that incorporates spatial attention mechanisms to capture fine-grained details and contextual information.In addition, we introduce a new loss function that takes into consideration the intra-class variance in the training process. This loss function helps to better capture the diversity within semantic categories, improving the segmentation performance.To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on a large dataset of remote sensing images. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy.In summary, this paper presents a novel algorithm for geospatial semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. Our approach incorporates advanced deep learning techniques and addresses the challenge of large intra-class variance. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our method and its potential for various applications in remote sensing analysis.
