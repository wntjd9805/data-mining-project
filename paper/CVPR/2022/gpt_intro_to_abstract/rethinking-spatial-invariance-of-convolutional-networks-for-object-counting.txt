Object counting is an important task with applications in crowd flow monitoring and traffic management. Previous works have focused on improving the spatial invariance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance object counting accuracy. However, recent studies have observed performance bottlenecks and noise during density map generation, which may be impacting the counting accuracy. In this paper, we thoroughly verify four mainstream object counting methods in three different counting tasks and find that strict pixel-level spatial invariance can lead to large prediction variances and overfitting to noise in the density map. To address these issues, we propose replacing traditional convolution operations with Gaussian convolution. This modification allows for a relaxation of pixel-level spatial invariance and avoids overfitting to the density map noise. We introduce a novel low-rank approximation approach to simulate Gaussian-style density map generation during feature extraction, which helps learn the object position and distribution in the density maps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in object counting tasks across various datasets. Our contributions include clarifying the unnecessary restrictiveness of spatial invariance in object counting, proposing a low-rank Gaussian convolution approach to handle noise in density map generation, and providing extensive experimental evidence to support the effectiveness of our method.
