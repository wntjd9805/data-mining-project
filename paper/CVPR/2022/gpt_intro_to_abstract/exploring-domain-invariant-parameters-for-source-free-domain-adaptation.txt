Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has gained popularity in recent years as a way to address the problem of distribution shift across different domains. However, in certain scenarios where data privacy is important, access to labeled source data may not be available. This poses a challenge for domain adaptation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) approach that leverages the knowledge of a source model without requiring access to the source data. Our method explores the domain-invariant parameters stored in the source model to achieve domain-invariant representations. We introduce a novel DIPE framework that incorporates a domain-balanced identifying criterion to determine domain-invariant and domain-specific parameters. Additionally, we propose a clustering correction technique to improve the learning process. Our approach offers a new perspective on SFDA and demonstrates promising results.
