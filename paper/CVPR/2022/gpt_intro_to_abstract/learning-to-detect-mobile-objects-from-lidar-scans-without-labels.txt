Autonomous driving has the potential to transform transportation, but self-driving vehicles require accurate 3D object detection to safely navigate their surroundings. Current state-of-the-art techniques rely on deep neural networks for object detection, but these methods rely heavily on labeled training data. The process of labeling data for 3D object detection is labor-intensive and expensive, and the resulting detectors are only effective when the training and test data distributions match. To address this limitation, we propose learning a 3D object detector from unlabeled LiDAR data, focusing on mobile objects such as vehicles and pedestrians. We leverage two key insights: the use of simple heuristics to occasionally distinguish between traffic participants and background objects, and the ability of neural networks to identify common patterns in noisy and diverse data. We introduce weak labels through heuristics based on the ephemerality of LiDAR points, classifying clusters with high ephemerality statistics as mobile objects. We then use self-training to improve the accuracy of the initial seed set of mobile objects, allowing the detector to learn the underlying object patterns and generate higher-quality bounding boxes. We evaluate our approach, MODEST, on two real-world datasets and demonstrate that it achieves remarkably accurate results, comparable to supervised methods. Our contributions include a novel approach for identifying seed mobile objects from unlabeled LiDAR data and the use of self-training to improve the accuracy of mobile object detection.
