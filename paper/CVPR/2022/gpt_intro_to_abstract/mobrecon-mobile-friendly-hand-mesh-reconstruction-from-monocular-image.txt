Single-view hand mesh reconstruction is a well-studied topic in computer science, with applications in augmented and virtual reality, behavior understanding, and more. Previous methods have focused primarily on reconstruction accuracy, but real-world applications also require inference efficiency and temporal consistency. This paper aims to explore 3D hand reconstruction specifically for mobile platforms, considering the limited computational resources available on such devices.The typical pipeline for single-view hand reconstruction consists of three phases: 2D encoding, 2D-to-3D mapping, and 3D decoding. Existing approaches often use computationally intensive networks for 2D encoding, making them unsuitable for mobile devices. Naively leveraging existing mobile networks leads to degraded accuracy. Therefore, this work proposes a lightweight 2D encoding structure tailored for balance between inference efficiency and accuracy. The efficiency of 2D-to-3D mapping and 3D decoding is also explored, aiming to develop lightweight and effective methods for these tasks.Temporal coherence, an important aspect for real-world applications, is often neglected in 3D hand reconstruction. Previous methods that incorporate temporal information are either offline or computationally expensive, which is impractical for mobile applications. To address this, the paper explores non-sequential methods for incorporating temporal coherence.The proposed approach, called Mobile Mesh Reconstruction (MobRecon), aims to achieve superior accuracy, efficiency, and temporal coherence. It leverages efficient stacked encoding structures for 2D encoding and proposes a novel graph operator called depth-separable spiral convolution (DSConv) for 3D decoding. A feature lifting module with map-based position regression (MapReg), pose pooling, and pose-to-vertex lifting (PVL) approaches is proposed for the 2D-to-3D mapping. This module enhances both 2D pose accuracy and temporal consistency while reducing model size. Additionally, a synthetic dataset with uniformly distributed hand poses and viewpoints is created, and comprehensive evaluations and comparisons show that MobRecon outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of model efficiency, reconstruction accuracy, and temporal coherence.In summary, this paper presents MobRecon, a mobile-friendly pipeline for 3D hand mesh reconstruction. It introduces lightweight encoding and decoding techniques, as well as a feature lifting module that bridges 2D and 3D representations. The proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of model efficiency, accuracy, and temporal coherence.
