Cereal grains, such as wheat, maize, and rice, play a crucial role in human civilization and daily life. Grain determination, which is essential for quality inspection and grade stratification, mainly involves chemical analysis and Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI). While chemical analysis can be conducted using various apparatus, GAI still relies on manual inspection by trained inspectors. This process is time-consuming and requires domain knowledge and expertise. Therefore, there is a need to develop an automated GAI system using deep learning techniques.Deep learning has shown remarkable success in computer vision applications, but applying it to GAI comes with two challenges. First, a deep understanding of GAI is required to properly formulate the grain determination problem as computer vision tasks. Second, the development of deep learning-based methods for GAI necessitates high-quality datasets that cover a wide variety of cereal grains.In this work, we address these challenges by conducting an in-depth analysis of cereal grains and considering the real-world requirements of GAI. We propose three fundamental computer vision tasks for GAI: fine-grained recognition, domain adaptation, and out-of-distribution recognition. We build device prototypes to efficiently capture images of cereal grains and construct a large-scale dataset called GrainSpace. This dataset contains 5.25 million images of wheat, maize, and rice grains collected from multiple countries and regions. The raw grain samples were manually processed by trained inspectors over a period of more than 4 years.To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we develop a benchmark on the GrainSpace dataset. We employ advanced techniques, such as semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning, to address the challenges in fine-grained recognition, domain adaptation, and out-of-distribution recognition. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements and the feasibility of automated GAI.In summary, our contributions include the construction of the publicly available GrainSpace dataset, the formulation of GAI-related work into three computer vision tasks, and the development of an initial benchmark with promising performance. This research paves the way for automated grain determination and inspection in the cereal industry.
