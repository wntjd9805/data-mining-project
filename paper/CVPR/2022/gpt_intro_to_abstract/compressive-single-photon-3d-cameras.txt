Single-photon cameras (SPCs) are highly sensitive sensors that can detect individual photons and record their arrival times with sub-nanosecond accuracy. These cameras, particularly those based on single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), are cost-effective and can achieve high-resolution imaging capabilities. As a result, SPAD-based SPCs have gained popularity in various applications, including 3D imaging, low-light imaging, HDR imaging, non-line-of-sight imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, and diffuse optical tomography.Unlike conventional cameras that output intensity values integrated over time, SPAD pixels generate electrical pulses for each photon detection event, with each pulse converted into a timestamp indicating the arrival time of the photon. To manage the large volume of timestamp data generated by SPAD pixels, SPCs build a timing histogram within the sensor itself. This histogram records the number of photons detected at different time delays relative to a synchronization pulse. However, capturing full histograms can lead to significant data rates, making it challenging to transfer and process the data using existing standards like USB and PCIe.To address this issue, this paper proposes a bandwidth-efficient acquisition strategy called compressive single-photon histograms (CSPH). Instead of capturing the full timing histogram, CSPHs are constructed by encoding the time bins onto multiple compressive bins using linear encoders represented by matrix operations. This encoding process allows for on-the-fly computation of photon arrivals without the need for storing large arrays of timestamps within the sensor. CSPHs decouple the output data rate from the desired depth resolution, resulting in significantly reduced data rates compared to full histogram capture methods.The paper presents various CSPH coding schemes for SPAD-based 3D cameras and introduces a decoding algorithm to estimate scene depths from CSPHs. The proposed method takes into account different laser pulse shapes and pixel response characteristics, ensuring accurate depth reconstruction. The paper includes extensive simulations and evaluations using both simulated data and real-world data captured using a single-pixel raster-scanning prototype. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the compressive acquisition method in reducing data rates while maintaining high-quality depth information.
