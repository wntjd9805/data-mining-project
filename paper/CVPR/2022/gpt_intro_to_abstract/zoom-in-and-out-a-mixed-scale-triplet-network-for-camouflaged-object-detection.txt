Camouflaged objects, such as chameleons and cuttlefishes, have the ability to blend seamlessly into their environment for self-protection. Camouflaged object detection (COD) is a challenging task due to the small size, similarity to the background, and occlusion of these objects. Although deep learning-based methods have made progress in COD, they still struggle to accurately and reliably detect camouflaged objects due to distractions from the background and the inability to segment objects from the chaotic background. In this paper, we propose a mixed-scale triplet network called ZoomNet to improve COD performance. ZoomNet uses scale space theory and a triplet architecture to extract scale-specific features and mines accurate and subtle semantic clues between objects and the background. We also introduce a shared weight strategy for efficiency. To address the issue of reliable prediction in complex scenarios, we design an uncertainty-aware loss (UAL) that guides the model training and enhances the prediction of uncertain regions. Our contributions include the proposal of ZoomNet, the design of SIUs and HMUs for accurate COD, the UAL optimization enhancement strategy, and the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods on various COD datasets.
