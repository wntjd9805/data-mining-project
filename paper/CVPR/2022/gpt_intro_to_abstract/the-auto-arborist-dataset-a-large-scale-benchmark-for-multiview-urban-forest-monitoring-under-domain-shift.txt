Urban forests provide critical benefits such as air and water filtration, stormwater runoff capture, carbon dioxide sequestration, erosion and drought prevention, energy savings, and reduction of urban heat islands. They also contribute to urban ecosystems, provide habitat for wildlife, and address social inequality. Monitoring urban forests is essential for quantifying ecosystem services, tracking weather damage, and targeting planting strategies. However, traditional tree censuses are expensive and conducted infrequently. This paper aims to lower the cost of tree censuses by leveraging computer vision technology to automate tree detection, labeling, and monitoring. The authors introduce the Auto Arborist dataset, which is significantly larger than previous datasets and covers multiple cities. They propose metrics to evaluate performance in the context of geographic distribution shifts and demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of deep learning models. This dataset not only contributes to sustainability and conservation efforts but also serves as a benchmark for domain generalization in computer vision. The paper highlights the importance of geographic coverage, multiple views, and data modalities for robust generalization. The main contributions of this work include the development of a pipeline for combining public tree census data with street level and aerial imagery, the creation of the Auto Arborist dataset, and the analysis of geographic domain shift and category imbalance on model performance. The findings emphasize the value of diverse geographic coverage and the benefits of leveraging multiple views and data modalities in urban forest monitoring.
