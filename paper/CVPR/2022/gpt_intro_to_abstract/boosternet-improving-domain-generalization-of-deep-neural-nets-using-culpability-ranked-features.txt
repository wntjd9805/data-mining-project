The rapid advancement of deep learning has made deep neural networks (DNNs) widely used in various fields, particularly in computer vision, including medical image analysis. However, one of the main concerns with DNNs is their vulnerability to domain shifts, leading to poor generalizability to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This limitation not only affects model performance but can also result in serious failures in real-life applications, such as healthcare. To address this problem, much research has focused on improving model generalizability through unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and domain generalization (DG) approaches. UDA aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled training domain to unlabeled test domains with the same classes. DG, on the other hand, aims to utilize information from one or more source domains to better generalize to OOD domains without access to test data. While these approaches have shown improvements, they still suffer from drawbacks such as the requirement of training data from multiple domains and changes in network architecture or learning strategy. These limitations make them less practical for end-users who may not have extensive knowledge in deep learning.In this work, we propose a single-source DG framework called BoosterNet to improve the generalizability of an off-the-shelf DNN. BoosterNet addresses the problem of shortcut learning and feature suppression, where a model tends to ignore certain input features, leading to poor generalization ability. To combat this, BoosterNet consists of an add-on network that learns from the most culpable features in the core network, associated with erroneous predictions. It also learns from the most predictive features to retain focus on important characteristics of the data. At inference time, BoosterNet processes a test image by extracting confusion and discriminant features, determined by a smart gating mechanism. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BoosterNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in single domain generalization on benchmark datasets, including digits and medical skin images. This framework provides a practical solution for improving the generalizability of DNNs without the need for extensive domain data or changes in network architecture.
