Multi-view clustering (MVC) has gained attention in computer vision for its ability to leverage correlated and complementary information from multi-view data to perform unsupervised clustering. Existing MVC methods, such as Co-EM, SwMC, GMC, SMSC, and MKKM, have achieved promising results. However, these methods still face challenges, including the absence of partial views among data points and sensitivity to noise and outliers. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework called multi-view probabilistic clustering (MPC) to address these challenges. MPC utilizes posterior probability to directly reflect the pairwise matching possibility between samples, which enhances tolerance to partial missing views and can be easily extended to any number of views. We also introduce graph-context-aware probability refinement techniques to mitigate the impact of noise and outliers. Additionally, we develop a fast probabilistic clustering algorithm that is robust to noise and does not require prior knowledge of cluster numbers. Experimental results demonstrate that MPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering performance and computational efficiency. The main contributions of this paper are the proposed MPC framework, which tolerates data missing and extends to any number of views, the graph-context-aware refinement techniques to address noise and outliers, and the fast probabilistic clustering algorithm that reduces computational complexity and does not require prior knowledge.
