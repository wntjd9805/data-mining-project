Automatic building footprint extraction is crucial for various applications such as disaster assessment, 3D-city modeling, and urban changing detection. While most advanced object extraction methods rely on pixel-wise segmentation using CNNs, they often result in fusion of adjacent instances or scattered islands. Additionally, they require complex post-processing and lack flexibility in distortion and zooming. To address these issues, active contour models have been proposed, where a snake gradually converges to the object boundary under the influence of internal and external energies. Modern CNN-based architectures have also been integrated with active contour models to improve border delineation. However, these contour-based methods have limitations in terms of their energy principle and contour modeling theory. In this paper, we propose a novel contour vibration network (CVNet) inspired by physical vibration theory. The CVNet models the evolution of object contours as the vibration of an elastic string under external forces. Unlike previous contour-based methods, CVNet follows Newton's second law of motion and utilizes a spatial-temporal contour vibration model, which is mathematically reduced to a second-order differential equation. The vibration model is concretized in the space of image features, and the contour changes are evolved through recursive computation. The proposed CVNet is evaluated on multiple building extraction datasets and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for polygon-based contour extraction. Our contributions include the proposal of the contour vibration model, the design of the contour vibration network, and the validation of the effectiveness of the method in building contour extraction.
