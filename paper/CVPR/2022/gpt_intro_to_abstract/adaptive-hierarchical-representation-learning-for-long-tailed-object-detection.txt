Abstract:Long-tailed object detection, where classes with few instances significantly differ from classes with plenty of instances, poses a challenge for traditional detection models. In this paper, we propose a method called Adaptive Hierarchical Representation Learning (AHRL) to address this problem. AHRL leverages a coarse-to-fine strategy and a two-stage training procedure to improve the performance of long-tailed object detection. In the first stage, a baseline model is trained using standard settings. In the second stage, an Adaptive Hierarchical Representation (AHR) loss function is introduced to implement the coarse-to-fine design. The AHR loss maintains a hierarchical structure and uses dynamic and adaptive margins to optimize the classification process. Extensive experiments conducted on the LVIS dataset demonstrate that AHRL achieves state-of-the-art results on both ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones. The proposed method provides a strong baseline for future research in long-tailed object detection.
