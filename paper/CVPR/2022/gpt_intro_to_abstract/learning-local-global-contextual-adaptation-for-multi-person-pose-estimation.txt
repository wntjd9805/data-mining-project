This paper addresses the problem of multi-person pose estimation from images without relying on bounding box priors, known as bottom-up pose estimation. While previous approaches have achieved impressive results in single-person pose estimation, the extension to multi-person configuration remains challenging. The authors propose a new approach called LOGO-CAP that leverages a center-offset baseline and introduces a searching scheme using local filters to improve accuracy. The empirical observation shows that the initial center-offset poses are already in close proximity to the ground truth keypoints, suggesting that the main challenge is local misplacement. To address this challenge, LOGO-CAP learns local and global keypoint expansion maps to refine the keypoints. Experimental results demonstrate that LOGO-CAP achieves significant improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to the vanilla center-offset method. However, there is still room for further improvement to reach the empirical upper bound. Overall, LOGO-CAP is a promising bottom-up pose estimation method with near real-time inference speed.
