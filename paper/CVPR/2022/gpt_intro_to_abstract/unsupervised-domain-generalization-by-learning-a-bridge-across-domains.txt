Recent literature in computer science has discussed the importance of learning to semantically generalize across domains without supervision in the target domain(s). This is especially relevant for tasks such as Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and Domain Generalization (DG), where the success of generalization implies the successful transfer of downstream tasks to new domains. However, most existing UDA and DG methods assume abundant source domain supervision, which may not always be available in real-life use cases.In this paper, we focus on the least restrictive setting of Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG), where no source domain supervision is required during training. This setting is particularly challenging as it supports generalization to completely new unseen visual domains with new unseen classes. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of a learnable Bridge Across Domains (BrAD), which acts as an auxiliary visual "bridge" domain that aligns the representations of different training domains.Our BrAD approach is based on the intuition that object edges seem to be a shared universal visual representation across domains. We teach the model to represent all visual domains in the same way as it represents edge-like images. During contrastive self-supervised training, the BrAD is used to semantically align the representations of each training domain with those of the shared BrAD. By transitivity, the representations for all domains become BrAD-aligned, enabling generalization even to new unseen domains at test time.We demonstrate that even a simple heuristic implementation of the BrAD idea, mapping images to their edge maps, improves upon strong self-supervised baselines. With the learnable BrAD, our method achieves good gains across various datasets and tasks, including UDG, Few-Shot UDA (FUDA), and generalization to different domains and classes. Our contributions include the proposal of a learnable BrAD concept, the demonstration of its effectiveness in training models for source-labels-limited cross-domain tasks, and the significant gains achieved in multiple benchmarks.
