Abstract:This paper introduces a modular transfer learning approach for semantic visual navigation in unfamiliar environments. The goal is to enable agents to learn one navigation task and apply the accumulated experience to multiple tasks, thus improving sample efficiency and reducing the need for specialized architectures and priors. The proposed approach involves training a general-purpose semantic search policy using a reward and task augmentation strategy. A joint goal embedding is developed to relate various target goal types to image-goals. Downstream tasks are addressed through zero-shot transfer or fine-tuning with limited agent experience. Experimental results on challenging tasks and goals expressed through different modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods in transfer learning and requires significantly fewer interactions for zero-shot experience learning compared to task-specific policies learned from scratch.
