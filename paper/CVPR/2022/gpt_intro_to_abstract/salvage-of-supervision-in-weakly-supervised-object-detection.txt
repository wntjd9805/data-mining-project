Large-scale datasets with precise annotations are crucial for developing detection algorithms, but they can be expensive to obtain. As a result, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), which only requires image-level labels on training images, has gained popularity. WSOD methods have borrowed ideas from fully supervised object detection (FSOD), such as object proposals and the Fast-RCNN framework. However, modern FSOD has abandoned external object proposals and has developed better techniques. Moreover, current WSOD methods mostly use VGG16 as the backbone and Fast-RCNN as the detector, limiting both accuracy and speed.This paper argues that WSOD must find ways to utilize the progress made in FSOD and harness every potential source of supervisory signal. The proposed Salvage of Supervision (SoS) framework seeks to address this challenge. The framework consists of three stages. In Stage 1, a detector is trained using any WSOD method, with an improved version of OICR as the chosen stage 1 method. Stage 2, known as pseudo-FSOD, focuses on generating good pseudo box-level annotations to boost performance and adopt newer FSOD techniques. This stage aims to salvage the supervision that is lacking in WSOD. Stage 3 introduces the concept of semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). The dataset is split into a "clean" and a "noisy" part, treating the noisy part as unlabeled. By creating a semi-supervised learning problem, additional useful supervisory signals are salvaged.Compared to existing WSOD methods, the SoS-WSOD framework not only harnesses all potentially useful supervisory signals but also enables WSOD to fully benefit from the accuracy and speed improvements seen in modern FSOD methods. The paper demonstrates that SoS-WSOD achieves higher accuracy and faster speed by generating high-quality pseudo box-level labels and incorporating a semi-supervised learning approach. The proposed framework significantly improves WSOD accuracy on benchmark datasets such as VOC2007, VOC2012, and MS-COCO.In summary, the contributions of this paper include the introduction of the SoS-WSOD framework, showcasing the importance of harnessing all potential supervisory signals in WSOD, and demonstrating the feasibility of bridging the gap between WSOD and FSOD. The proposed pseudo-FSOD approach achieves higher accuracy and faster speed, leading to substantial improvements in WSOD performance.
