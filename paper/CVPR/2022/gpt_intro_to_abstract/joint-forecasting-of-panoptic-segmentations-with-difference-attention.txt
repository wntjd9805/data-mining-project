Forecasting is essential for the safe and efficient operation of autonomous systems. To achieve accurate forecasting, various representations have been studied in different domains such as computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. These representations include trajectories, bounding boxes, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, images, and panoptic segmentations. In this paper, we specifically focus on panoptic segmentations as they effectively distinguish between objects that change position due to observer motion and those that change position due to both observer and instance motion.However, the state-of-the-art method for panoptic segmentation forecasting faces two main challenges. Firstly, it independently predicts the foreground of individual instances, ignoring the correlations between the movements of different instances. This approach is suboptimal, especially when considering complex traffic patterns. Secondly, the method assumes that object instance segmentation forecasts always occur in front of the background segmentation forecast, disregarding the possibility of background objects being closer to the camera than foreground entities, which is not realistic.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that tackles both issues. Firstly, we introduce a modified attention module called "difference attention" for transformer models, which allows for reasoning about velocities and acceleration. This is particularly relevant in forecasting tasks (such as panoptic segmentation), where traditional inner-product attention falls short. Secondly, we develop a refinement head that improves the estimation of background depth and compares it to the foreground predictions. This ensures accurate reasoning about the placement of objects and background in the scene.To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on the Cityscapes and AIODrive datasets. The results demonstrate that the combination of difference attention and refinement significantly improves forecasting accuracy, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance with 37.6 PQ for mid-term forecasting on Cityscapes and 48.5 PQ on AIODrive. The code to reproduce our results is publicly available on GitHub.In conclusion, this paper introduces a novel approach for panoptic segmentation forecasting that addresses the challenges of independent instance prediction and inaccurate reasoning about object-background placement. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its potential to advance forecasting techniques in autonomous systems.
