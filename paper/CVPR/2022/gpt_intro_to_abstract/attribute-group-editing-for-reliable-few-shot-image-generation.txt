The paper introduces Attribute Group Editing (AGE), a new method for few-shot image generation using pretrained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The authors highlight that while GANs have enabled the generation of high-quality and diverse images, training a good GAN model requires a large amount of training data. Few-shot image generation, which involves generating new realistic and diverse images for unseen categories with only a few training samples, is a challenging task.Existing methods for few-shot image generation fall into three categories: optimization-based, fusion-based, and transformation-based. However, these methods have limitations in terms of image quality, similarity to input images, and stability of training. Drawing on the concept of StyleGAN, which treats images as collections of different attributes, the authors propose AGE to identify category-relevant and category-irrelevant editing directions without explicit supervision. The core idea is to factorize the meaningful directions for attributes and use Sparse Dictionary Learning to model the editing process.The contributions of the paper are threefold: 1. Proposing the perspective of diverse image generation through category-irrelevant editing.2. Introducing AGE, a method for identifying category-relevant and category-irrelevant editing directions from a pretrained GAN without explicit supervision.3. Demonstrating through experiments that AGE achieves stable few-shot image generation with high quality and diversity, and can also be used for controllable image generation based on the learned attribute dictionary.
