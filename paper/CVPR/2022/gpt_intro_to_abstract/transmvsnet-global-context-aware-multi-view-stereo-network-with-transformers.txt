Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a task in computer vision that aims to reconstruct the dense 3D representation from a series of calibrated images. Learning-based MVS networks have made significant progress in terms of reconstruction quality and efficiency. However, there are two main challenges in the existing MVS pipeline. Firstly, local features captured by convolutions in the CNN-based image feature extraction process prevent the perception of global context information, which is crucial for robust depth estimation in challenging regions of MVS. Secondly, potential inter-image correspondences are not taken into consideration when computing matching costs. To address these challenges, we propose TransMVSNet, an end-to-end deep neural network that leverages a Feature Matching Transformer (FMT) for long-range global context aggregation. The FMT aggregates context information within and between images using attention and positional encoding mechanisms. To seamlessly integrate the FMT into the MVS pipeline, we introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field (ARF) module to ensure a smooth transition from locally aggregated features to globally receptive features. We also bridge different scales with a transformed feature pathway to reduce memory requirements and train the FMT with supervision from high-resolution depth maps. We measure the similarity between the reference and source feature maps using pair-wise feature correlation and adopt a coarse-to-fine volume regularization pattern and focal loss to train the network. TransMVSNet achieves significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy and completeness on the DTU dataset and Tanks and Temples benchmark compared to state-of-the-art learning-based MVS methods. Our main contributions are three-fold: (1) the proposal of TransMVSNet, an end-to-end network leveraging the FMT for long-range global context aggregation, (2) the introduction of the ARF module and ambiguity-aware focal loss to adapt the FMT into the MVS pipeline, and (3) the achievement of state-of-the-art results on various datasets.
