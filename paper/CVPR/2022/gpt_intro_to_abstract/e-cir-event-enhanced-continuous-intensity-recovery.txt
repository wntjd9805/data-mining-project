This paper addresses the problem of converting blurry images into sharp videos by reconstructing the complete motion trajectory that causes the blurriness. Previous works have focused on converting blurry images into sharp ones, but recently, algorithms that reconstruct the motion trajectory have gained attention. The authors propose a continuous video representation using parametric polynomials, where each pixel's intensity is represented as a polynomial function. They also introduce a deep neural network that learns to regress the polynomial coefficients for sharp video reconstruction. A refinement module is used to improve frame quality and ensure temporal smoothness. The proposed method achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. The authors provide an open-source benchmark dataset and code for future comparisons. Overall, this paper contributes to video representations and methodologies for recovering accurate and temporally consistent videos from blurry images.
