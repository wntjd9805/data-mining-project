In recent years, there have been remarkable advances in 2D perception systems, enabling accurate object recognition and localization from images. However, these systems lack the ability to perceive the geometric shape, structure, and pose of objects in the scene, which is crucial for many applications. On the other hand, there has been notable progress in estimating 3D object geometry from visual data. This paper introduces a novel approach called ROCA, which combines object detection, depth estimation, and CAD model alignment to enable 3D perception from an RGB image. ROCA formulates a differentiable pose optimization coupled with CAD retrieval to achieve robust and accurate CAD alignment. The method also learns geometry-aware embeddings for CAD retrieval, improving both retrieval and alignment accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that ROCA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both retrieval-aware alignment accuracy and alignment accuracy from a single RGB image. The proposed end-to-end architecture facilitates real-time applications with an interactive runtime of 53 milliseconds per image.
