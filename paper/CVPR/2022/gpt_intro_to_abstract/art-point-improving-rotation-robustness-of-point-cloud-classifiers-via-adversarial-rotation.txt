This paper addresses the challenge of improving the robustness of point cloud classifiers to arbitrary rotations. Existing methods in this area can be classified into three categories: rotation augmentation, rotation invariance, and rotation equivariance. However, these methods have limitations such as the requirement for extensive pre-processing or complex architectural modifications. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a new framework called ART-Point, inspired by adversarial training. The framework treats rotation as an attack and leverages adversarial examples to train the network for rotation robustness. The authors develop an axis-wise rotation attack algorithm to find the most aggressive rotated samples, and a rotation pool to increase the diversity of training data. Additionally, they introduce a fast one-step optimization method to solve the min-max problem. The ART-Point framework aims to optimize network parameters to achieve natural robustness to both arbitrary and adversarial rotations, without the need for geometric descriptor extractions or architectural modifications. Experimental results on two datasets and three point cloud classifiers demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving rotation robustness while maintaining performance on clean data. The contributions of this paper include successfully improving rotation robustness from the perspective of model attack and defense, proposing efficient attack and defense algorithms, and validating the methods on multiple datasets and classifiers.
