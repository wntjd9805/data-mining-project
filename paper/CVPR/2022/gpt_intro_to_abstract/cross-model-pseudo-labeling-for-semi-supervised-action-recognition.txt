The rapid advancement of deep learning has been highly successful in action recognition. However, acquiring a substantial number of annotated videos for supervised learning is challenging in practice. In contrast, there is an abundance of unlabeled videos available on platforms like YouTube, with approximately 500 hours of video uploaded every minute worldwide. This presents an opportunity to leverage unlabeled videos for semi-supervised learning, which can significantly benefit action recognition.  To incorporate supervision from unlabeled data, a common approach is to assign pseudo-labels and treat them as "ground-truth" during training. However, the limited discriminative power obtained from a small amount of labeled data can lead to inadequate pseudo-labels and restrict the potential gain from unlabeled data.  This paper proposes a new approach that achieves 17.6% and 25.1% Top-1 accuracy on the Kinetics-400 and UCF-101 datasets, respectively, outperforming the existing FixMatch method. Additionally, a comprehensive empirical analysis is conducted to demonstrate how cross-model supervision improves performance, with the auxiliary network complementing the primary network on specific classes.
