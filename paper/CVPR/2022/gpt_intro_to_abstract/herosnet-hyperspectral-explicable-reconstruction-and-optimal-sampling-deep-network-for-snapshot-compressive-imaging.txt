This paper introduces a novel deep unfolding network called HerosNet for jointly optimizing binary masks and reconstructing high-quality hyperspectral images (HSIs). The network consists of a sampling subnet, an initialization subnet, and a recovery subnet. Inspired by the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), the recovery phase of HerosNet updates the current estimate using a dynamic gradient descent module (DGDM) and refines the estimate using a hierarchical feature interaction module (HFIM). By learning all parameters end-to-end, HerosNet achieves high-quality reconstruction with strong interpretability. The proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulation and real datasets. The contributions of this work include the introduction of HerosNet, the use of DGDM for flexible sensing matrix simulation, and the design of HFIM for improved feature interaction. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of HerosNet in HSI reconstruction.
