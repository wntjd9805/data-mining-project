In this paper, we address the challenge of automatically assembling complex CAD assemblies without prior knowledge of the global design, class labels, or human input. We introduce JoinABLe (Joint Assembly Bottom-up Learning), a bottom-up approach to assembly that leverages the weak supervision available in parametric CAD files. By learning how parts connect locally to form parametric CAD joints, JoinABLe can assemble pairs of parts without relying on object or part class labels, human annotation, or user guidance. We also introduce the Fusion 360 Gallery assembly dataset, which contains CAD assemblies with rich information on joints, contact surfaces, holes, and the underlying assembly graph structure. Our experimental results demonstrate that by making network predictions over a graph representation of solid models, JoinABLe outperforms multiple baseline methods while using fewer network parameters. Additionally, our approach performs well even in difficult cases where heuristic algorithms may struggle, achieving an accuracy of 79.53% on the joint axis prediction task, approaching human performance (80%). The ultimate goal of this work is to enable the development of assembly aware tools that can increase the reuse of existing components and streamline robotic assembly and disassembly, contributing to the reduction of the negative environmental impact of physical products.
