Image classification tasks have seen significant advancements with the use of deep learning and large labeled datasets. However, deep models still struggle when faced with limited or no labeled data. To address this issue, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) have been proposed. ZSL recognizes objects from unseen classes by first training a model on seen classes and then transferring the model to unseen classes using class-level semantic descriptors. GZSL aims to identify samples from both seen and unseen classes during testing. GZSL methods often face the challenge of misclassifying unseen class samples into seen classes due to the strong bias problem. Feature generation based GZSL methods have been proposed to mitigate this problem by synthesizing training samples for unseen classes conditioned on semantic descriptors. These methods merge real seen training features with synthetic unseen features to train a GZSL classification model. However, early feature generation methods lack discriminative ability, and methods that search for a new embedding space based on inter-class relationships can have confusing distributions for synthetic unseen features. This paper proposes an Intra-Class Compactness Enhancement method (ICCE) for GZSL. The ICCE promotes intra-class compactness with inter-class separability in the embedding space and visual feature space for both seen and unseen classes. The ICCE achieves this by utilizing a Self-Distillation Embedding (SDE) module and a Semantic-Visual Contrastive Generation (SVCG) module. The SDE module aligns representations and predicted logits to reduce intra-class variations and obtain compact distributions in the embedding space. The SVCG module synthesizes compact distributed features for unseen classes using a conditional GAN with instance-wise semantic-visual contrastive loss. Experimental results show that the ICCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets and achieves competitive results on others. The contributions of this paper are the proposed ICCE method, the SDE module for learning an intra-class compact embedding space, and the SVCG module for synthesizing compact distributed features for unseen classes.
