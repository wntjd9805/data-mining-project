In many real-life image analysis applications, such as electron microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, the appearance of objects of interest is affected by a sequence of transformations. This paper introduces a generic unsupervised framework called Harmony, which aims to disentangle semantic content from multiple parameterized transformations in images. Unlike traditional disentangled representation learning methods, Harmony explicitly considers prior knowledge about the types of transformations present in the data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Harmony in disentangling content from geometric and lighting condition transformations in various image datasets, including 2D single-particle cryo-EM images and 3D cryo-ET subtomograms. Harmony achieves remarkable results in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showing improved disentanglement compared to baseline methods. Moreover, Harmony is the first method to apply cross-contrastive learning for unsupervised content-transformation disentangling. This framework has the potential to be applied in various image analysis domains and can be extended beyond the realm of imaging. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of Harmony as a generic framework, the successful disentanglement of semantic content from multiple transformations, the resolution of transformation-invariant representations of proteins from 2D cryo-EM images, and the disentanglement of transformation parameters from 3D images to model structural heterogeneity in cryo-ET subtomograms.
