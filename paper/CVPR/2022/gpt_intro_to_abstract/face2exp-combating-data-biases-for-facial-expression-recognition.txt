Facial expression recognition (FER) plays a crucial role in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, existing FER training datasets suffer from bias towards majority classes, leading to poor accuracy for minority classes. Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on biased data tend to favor majority classes and perform poorly on minority classes. Early FER methods attempted to address the class bias issue by incorporating facial movements as side information or removing ambiguous samples from the training set. However, these methods are limited by the availability and cost of additional labeled data. In this paper, we propose the Meta-Face2Exp framework, which leverages large-scale unlabeled face recognition (FR) datasets to improve expression recognition. We use a meta optimization framework to minimize the loss function on challenging facial expressions, conditioned on balanced FER data. Our approach consists of two networks connected via a circuit feedback paradigm: a base network that learns de-biased knowledge on FER data and an adaptation network that distills facial expression knowledge from FR data. Through extensive experiments on popular FER benchmarks, our proposed framework achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods using only 10% of labeled FER data. Our work not only addresses data biases in FER, but also provides a cost-effective paradigm for facial expression recognition.
