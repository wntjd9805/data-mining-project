3D line segment reconstruction is a challenging task in computer vision and is crucial in various applications such as 3D scene abstraction, dense matching, plane detection, and surface reconstruction. The existing line reconstruction methods lack an elegant solution for fast and robust line matching in two views, mainly due to the indistinct nature of line segments in both texture and geometry. In this paper, we propose a geometry-guided matching approach to improve 3D line segment reconstruction. Our method takes advantage of the fact that line segments tend to lie on scene planes and leverages the rough 3D model to guide line matching. We use local homography to constrain the line candidate to a small region with sparse 3D points obtained from efficient structure-from-motion methods. We address two challenges: accurately and efficiently finding all scene planes in complex city scenes, and dealing with the rough depth-constraint due to sparse 3D points and indistinct line geometry. Our method, called ELSR, consists of three components: homography estimation, guided matching, and line abstraction. Experimental results demonstrate that ELSR is more efficient and accurate than existing algorithms, as it effectively constrains the candidate region in the second view using plane and point guidance.
