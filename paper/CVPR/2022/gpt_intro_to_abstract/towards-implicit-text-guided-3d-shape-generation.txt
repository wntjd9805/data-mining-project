This paper introduces a new approach for text-guided 3D shape generation. The existing works in this field mainly focus on generating overall shapes, while this work aims to generate shapes with more details. The goal is to develop a method that can automatically generate a 3D shape based on a given text description. The proposed approach leverages implicit representation to predict an occupancy field and addresses several challenges related to shape distortion, color blur, spatial-relation information, consistency with input texts, and diversity of results. The paper presents techniques such as decoupling shape and color predictions, word-level spatial transformer, cyclic loss, and style-based latent shape generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing works in terms of quality and quantity. The framework also allows for text-guided 3D shape manipulation by producing new shapes according to edited text. Overall, this research has significant potential for efficient 3D shape production and can assist users in generating and editing 3D models for various applications.
