Physiological signals, such as heart rate (HR), respiration frequency (RF), and heart rate variability (HRV), are important for healthcare and medical purposes. Traditional methods for measuring these signals, such as Electrocardiography (ECG) and Photoplethysmography (PPG), require sensors to be attached to the body, which can be uncomfortable for long-term monitoring. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) methods have been developed to measure heart activity without any contact. Previous studies have used classical signal processing, color subspace transformation, and learning-based approaches to analyze facial rPPG measurement. However, these methods often neglect global contextual clues and can be influenced by complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end video transformer architecture called PhysFormer for remote physiological measurement. PhysFormer utilizes long-range spatio-temporal attention to enhance rPPG features and uses supervision in the frequency domain to improve learning efficiency and alleviate overfitting. Experimental results show that PhysFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance without pretraining on large-scale datasets. Our contributions include exploring the long-range spatio-temporal relationship for reliable rPPG measurement, proposing supervision methods to enhance learning, and demonstrating the effectiveness of PhysFormer through experimental evaluation.
