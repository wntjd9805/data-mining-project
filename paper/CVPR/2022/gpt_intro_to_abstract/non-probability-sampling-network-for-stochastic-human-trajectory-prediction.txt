This paper focuses on the prediction of pedestrian trajectories by inferring socially-acceptable paths while considering the social norms of other moving agents. Previous approaches in human trajectory prediction have primarily used deterministic methods that yield a single most likely path. However, recent developments in generative models have shifted towards predicting the distribution of potential future trajectories, allowing for multi-modality and diverse predictions. These generative models introduce a stochastic process to capture the uncertainty of pedestrian movements. Random sampling is commonly used to generate multiple hypotheses, but it can be biased due to the limited number of samples. This paper introduces a Gaussian distribution-based approach that minimizes bias and achieves better performance compared to other methods. Additionally, the paper explores the use of latent variables and graph-based approaches to capture social interactions among pedestrians. To address the limitations of random sampling, the paper introduces a Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling method and Non-Probability Sampling Network (NPSN) to generate purposive sample sequences. The proposed approach significantly improves the performance of pedestrian trajectory prediction and is the first attempt to adopt QMC sampling and propose a learnable method for purposive sampling in this domain.
