The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has enabled the first imaging of a black hole, marking a new era in black hole research. By using Very Large Baseline Interferometry, the EHT can capture the direct environment around a black hole with unprecedented resolution. While the black hole itself is not visible, the EHT aims to image its imprint or "shadow" on the emission from the surrounding hot gas. The two candidate black holes for EHT observation are M87∗ and Sagittarius A∗ (SgrA∗), with SgrA∗ being more dynamic and exhibiting strong flares of emission. These flares are believed to be caused by compact bright emission spots or hot-spots in orbit around the black hole. This paper presents a novel tomography approach to reconstruct the dynamic 3D emission distribution of these hot-spots using observations from a single viewpoint. The challenges faced in this tomography include curved ray paths due to gravitational lensing and the limitation of a single fixed viewpoint. The proposed solution, BH-NeRF, utilizes a coordinate-based neural network to represent the 3D emission and leverages knowledge of Keplerian orbit dynamics to relate emission points across time. This approach builds upon recent advances in neural representations of radiance fields and shows promising results in recovering the 3D dynamics around a black hole. The significance of this research lies in its contribution to the advancement of astronomy over the next decade.
