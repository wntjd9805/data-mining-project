This paper introduces a novel framework called IntentVizor for query-driven video summarization. With the increasing need for automatic video summarization in the era of online explosive video content, traditional summarization methods fall short in meeting user preferences and practical value. The concept of intent is borrowed from the Information Retrieval community to define users' needs, and a distribution over basis intents is used to represent the intent, allowing for interactive manipulation and satisfying diverse and subtle needs. The IntentVizor framework consists of an intent module for extracting the intent from the query and a summary module for generating the video summary based on the intent. A Granularity-Scalable Ego-Graph Convolutional Network (GSE-GCN) is designed as a shared backbone for both modules to effectively correlate video features with generic queries of different modalities. The proposed framework is the first attempt to introduce generic queries to better satisfy user needs, provides a novel dataset for visual-query-guided video summarization, formulates summarization as an interactive process with an adjustable intent interface, and proposes a novel GSE-GCN structure for multi-modal query-video correlation.
