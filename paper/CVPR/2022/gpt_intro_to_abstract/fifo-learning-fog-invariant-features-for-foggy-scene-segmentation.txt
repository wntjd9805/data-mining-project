Semantic segmentation has made significant advancements in recent years. However, existing models and datasets primarily focus on improving accuracy in controlled environments, neglecting image degradation caused by adverse weather conditions and other factors. The robustness of semantic segmentation models against these factors is crucial for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we specifically investigate semantic segmentation of foggy scenes, which poses a challenge due to the severe visibility damage caused by fog. Existing approaches that attach a fog removal network to a pre-existing model have limitations in effectively mitigating this issue. Additionally, the absence of fully annotated data for foggy scenes further complicates the task. To address these issues, we propose a new method called FIFO (Fog-Invariant features for FOggy scene segmentation). FIFO learns fog-invariant features by considering the fog condition of an image as its style and aims to close the style discrepancy between different fog domains in the feature space. Unlike previous methods, FIFO does not require controlling fog density levels or additional modules for estimating and manipulating fog density in training. Experimental results demonstrate that FIFO outperforms existing methods and improves performance on both foggy and clear weather domains.
