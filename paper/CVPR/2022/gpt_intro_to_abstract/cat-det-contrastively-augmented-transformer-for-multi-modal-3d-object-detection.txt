3D object detection is a crucial step in autonomous driving systems as it provides important spatial information about objects in the environment. However, the distribution of point-clouds obtained from LiDAR sensors is disordered, irregular, and sparse, making 3D object detection challenging. In recent years, various methods have been proposed for 3D object detection, categorized into grid-based and point-based approaches. Grid-based methods convert point-clouds into regular grids or voxels and use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to encode geometric information. Point-based methods directly process raw points using deep learning networks such as PointNet or graph neural networks. Recent studies have shown that hybrid representations, integrating point-based and grid-based networks, yield improved results. Another strategy for enhancing 3D object detection is multimodal fusion, which combines 3D point-clouds with 2D images. Although images alone may not be as effective as an independent modality, the combination of geometric and textural information from point-clouds and images has shown promising results. Various fusion schemes have been proposed, including data-level, feature-level, and box-level fusion. However, there is still a performance gap between multimodal methods and LiDAR-only methods. This gap is attributed to limited contextual information extraction, inadequate feature fusion, and challenges in data augmentation for multimodal methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called CAT-Det that addresses these challenges. CAT-Det consists of a Pointformer branch and an Imageformer branch, which capture global context information from point-clouds and images, respectively. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Transformer module conducts cross-modal feature interaction and combination, highlighting essential cues from both modalities with fine-grained weights. We also introduce a one-way multi-modal data augmentation approach that effectively augments point-clouds using hierarchical contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI test set, outperforming previous methods and demonstrating its ability to detect hard objects.
