Abstract: 3D object tracking with point clouds has become a popular research area due to its potential applications in autonomous driving, motion planning, and robotics. However, there are still challenges such as sparsity, incompleteness, and texture feature absence in 3D tracking. This paper focuses on single-object tracking (SOT) and proposes a novel tracking paradigm called Point Tracking TRansformer (PTTR) that achieves high-quality 3D object tracking in a coarse-to-fine fashion. PTTR employs the PointNet++ backbone for extracting point features from the template and search area and introduces a Relation-Aware Sampling strategy to address point sparsity. The paper also introduces a Point Relation Transformer (PRT) with Relation Attention Module for effective feature matching and a lightweight Prediction Refinement Module for coarse prediction refinement. Furthermore, the paper presents a new comprehensive benchmark dataset named Waymo SOT Dataset, which complements the existing KITTI tracking dataset. Extensive experiments on both datasets demonstrate that PTTR outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The key contributions of this paper include the proposal of PTTR, a transformer-based 3D point cloud object tracking method, the design of novel modules, and the generation of a new large-scale point cloud tracking dataset.
