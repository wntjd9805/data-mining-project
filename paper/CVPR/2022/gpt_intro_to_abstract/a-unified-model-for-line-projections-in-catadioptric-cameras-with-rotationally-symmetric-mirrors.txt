This paper introduces catadioptric cameras, which combine mirrors with perspective cameras to achieve a 360-degree field of view with a single image. These cameras have various applications in fields such as robotics and medical imaging. While central perspective models can be used to theoretically model catadioptric cameras, this requires specific mirrors and perfect alignment and positioning of the camera.Due to the non-linear distortions in catadioptric systems, the modeling of point and line projections is more complex compared to perspective cameras. Researchers have made efforts to derive a unified model for point projection in both central and non-central systems. However, a unified model for line projection has not been proposed yet, although it has applications in computer vision tasks such as camera calibration, epipolar geometry, and 3D reconstruction.Existing work on self-calibration of non-central catadioptric cameras assumes central approximations for computing epipolar lines. On the other hand, imaging models for representing any camera, central or non-central, have been proposed. The advantages of non-central cameras have been discussed, such as the ability to recover the 3D parameters of lines from a single image.This paper presents the first unified model for the projection of 3D straight lines in general catadioptric cameras with rotationally symmetric mirrors, considering both central and non-central systems. The degrees of the polynomials used in prior methods and results obtained from the proposed model are shown. The related work, problem definition, derivation of the unified model, experiments, and conclusion of the paper are presented in subsequent sections.
