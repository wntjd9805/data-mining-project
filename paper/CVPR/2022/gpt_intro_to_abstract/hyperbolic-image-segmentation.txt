This paper explores the use of hyperbolic manifolds as embedding spaces for machine learning and computer vision tasks. Previous work has shown that hyperbolic embeddings can effectively represent hierarchies and tree-like structures. The authors propose a reformulation of multinomial logistic regression in the Poincar√© ball to enable pixel-level hyperbolic deep learning. They also demonstrate the benefits of hyperbolic image segmentation, including natural measures for uncertainty estimation and semantic boundary estimation. Additionally, hyperbolic embeddings with hierarchical knowledge improve zero-label generalization and are preferred for fewer embedding dimensions. The findings suggest potential applications in explainability and on-device segmentation.
