Instance segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in various fields. While current instance segmentation approaches have shown promising results, accurately segmenting fine details in boundary areas remains challenging. To address this issue, recent research has focused on boundary refinement, introducing metrics and methods to improve boundary accuracy. However, existing refinement methods often prioritize accuracy over efficiency and generality, making them less practical for real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel boundary refinement approach called SharpContour that aims to achieve accuracy, efficiency, and generality simultaneously. Unlike pixel-wise refinement methods, SharpContour adopts a contour-based representation, leveraging contour-based segmentation methods. However, existing contour-based methods tend to produce oversmoothed contours, leading to performance limitations in boundary areas. To overcome this, SharpContour introduces a new contour evolution process that independently estimates deformation offsets for each contour vertex. This allows for more precise and localized adjustments, avoiding the chain reaction effect of traditional contour-based methods. To determine the deformation of each vertex, SharpContour employs an Instance-aware Point Classifier (IPC) that predicts the "inner/outer" status of a vertex with respect to different instance boundaries. The IPC is designed to be instance-aware and capture boundary details, resulting in high fidelity refinement. The moving distance of each vertex is determined by the object size and IPC probability score, ensuring accurate adjustments. Experimental results on various segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SharpContour, showing significant improvements in boundary accuracy compared to other refinement models. Additionally, SharpContour can seamlessly integrate with different segmentation models, providing high-quality object boundaries with low computational cost. Overall, SharpContour offers a practical and effective solution to the boundary refinement problem in instance segmentation.
