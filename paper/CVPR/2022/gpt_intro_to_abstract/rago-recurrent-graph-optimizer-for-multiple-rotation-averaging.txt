Multiple Rotation Averaging (MRA) is a significant problem in 3D computer vision that aims to determine the absolute orientations of multiple cameras given their relative orientations. It has been extensively studied in various applications, including global Structure from Motion, pose graph optimization in Visual SLAM, and sensor network problems. Solving MRA is challenging due to nonlinearity, parameterization and normalization requirements, outliers, and noise in the input relative orientations. Traditional methods rely on iterative optimization with careful initialization and robust cost functions but struggle with severe corruptions and various noises.Recent learning-based methods have approached MRA as a regression problem but require good initialization and face limitations in handling gauge ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method that combines the advantages of geometric and learning-based methods. Our approach decouples the MRA problem into multiple Single Rotation Averaging (SRA) problems and uses a Massage Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to iteratively optimize the global camera rotations. Unlike traditional methods, MPNN considers larger respective fields and achieves better results. Additionally, we learn to rectify the relative measurements to handle noises and outliers, eliminating the need for online refinement or edge reweighting.To improve robustness and efficiency, we utilize a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) module to leverage historical information. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, even with random initialization. Compared to previous approaches, our method outperforms in terms of accuracy after just two iterations. Our contributions include presenting an end-to-end learning-to-optimize recurrent graph neural network for MRA, decoupling MRA into SRA problems to improve results and learning, proposing relative orientation rectification during optimization, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.
