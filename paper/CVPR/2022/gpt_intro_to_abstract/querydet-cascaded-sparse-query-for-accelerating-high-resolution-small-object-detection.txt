This paper introduces QueryDet, a method for improving small object detection in visual object detection systems. Despite recent advancements in deep learning, detecting small objects remains a challenging problem. The performance gap between small and normal scale objects is significant. The degradation in performance for small objects is primarily caused by downsampling operations in the backbone of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), mismatches between the receptive field and size of small objects, and the difficulty in localizing small objects accurately. Previous approaches to improving small object detection include scaling the size of input images or reducing the downsampling rate of CNN to maintain high-resolution features. However, these methods often incur high computation costs. This paper proposes QueryDet, which saves computation in the detection head while promoting the performance of small objects. The method leverages the redundancy in computation on low-level features and the structured nature of feature pyramids. It applies the detection head only to the spatial locations of small objects, which are located using a cascade sparse query mechanism. This approach significantly reduces the computation cost of the detection head while maintaining detection accuracy for small objects. The proposed method is evaluated on the COCO detection benchmark and the VisDrone dataset, demonstrating improvements in detection performance and inference speed for small objects. The contributions of this work include the introduction of the QueryDet method, which reduces computation costs in feature pyramid based object detectors, and the improvement of detection performance and inference speed for small objects.
