Pedestrian trajectory forecasting is a task that involves predicting the future paths of pedestrians by utilizing individual trajectory information and the influence between pedestrians. This task has practical applications in advanced surveillance systems, behavioral analysis, intrusion detection, and smart vehicles and autonomous systems. While recent research has focused on developing deep-network architectures for this task, little attention has been given to the inference phase of trajectory prediction. Typically, data-driven models are trained and evaluated on large public datasets that are refined with human intervention. However, this process is not feasible at inference time, so the input trajectories needed for prediction must be automatically extracted by a tracking system. The commonly used 8-12 protocol, which requires data collected at 2.5 FPS, does not provide a large margin of correction for tracking errors. To overcome this limitation, this work proposes an approach based on Knowledge Distillation, which reduces the length of input trajectories while maintaining prediction accuracy. The approach uses a teacher-student paradigm and transformer-based architectures to capture spatial and temporal interactions. A distillation procedure is employed to adapt the student network to a limited number of observations. The objective function considers ground-truth data and distillation losses to align teacher and student representations. The contributions of this work include a detailed analysis of the evaluation protocol used in trajectory prediction, a novel distillation strategy for reducing input trajectory length, and the exploration of the student's adaptability and transferability in different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with accurate predictions achieved using only two observations per pedestrian at inference time. This is made possible by leveraging the global knowledge inferred from training data and distilled into the inference model.
