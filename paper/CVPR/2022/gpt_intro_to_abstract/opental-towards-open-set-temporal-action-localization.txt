This paper introduces the Open Set Temporal Action Localization (OSTAL) problem, which aims to temporally localize and recognize known actions while rejecting localized unknown actions in untrimmed videos. Traditional Temporal Action Localization (TAL) approaches assume a closed set assumption where only pre-defined action categories are present, which is impractical in the open world scenario. The proposed OSTAL approach overcomes this limitation by addressing the challenge of handling unknown actions. The paper presents a comparison between TAL and OSTAL tasks, demonstrating the necessity of rejecting positively localized unknown actions in the open world.
