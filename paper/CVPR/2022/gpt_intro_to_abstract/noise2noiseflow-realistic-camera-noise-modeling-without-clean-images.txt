Image noise modeling is a crucial problem in computer vision with broad applications. Current data-driven noise models based on deep learning techniques typically require clean images for training, which are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a new approach called Noise2NoiseFlow, which accurately learns noise models without the need for clean images. Instead, our method only requires pairs of noisy images of the same scene. Noise modeling is essential for various downstream tasks, such as removing fixed pattern effects from CMOS sensors and enhancing video in extreme low-light conditions. It can also be used to train noise reduction algorithms without the need for clean and noisy image pairs. Previous attempts at noise modeling have fallen short in capturing realistic noise characteristics. Simple Gaussian noise models ignore signal dependence, while heteroscedastic Gaussian noise fails to consider spatial non-uniformities and other factors. Noise Flow, a recent parametric structure using conditional normalizing flows, overcomes some limitations but necessitates supervised data for training. Gathering supervised data is challenging and limits the realistic characterization of noise. In the context of image denoising, recent methods have aimed to reduce the need for supervised data. However, these methods primarily focus on denoising rather than noise modeling. In this work, we extend the Noise2Noise framework to train a noise model with pairs of independently sampled noisy images. Our Noise2NoiseFlow approach produces both a denoiser and an explicit noise model, both of which perform competitively with or outperform fully supervised training of these models individually.
