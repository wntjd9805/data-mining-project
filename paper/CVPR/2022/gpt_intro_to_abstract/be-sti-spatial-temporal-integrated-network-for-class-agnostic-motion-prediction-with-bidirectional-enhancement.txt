Modern self-driving vehicles operate in dynamic traffic scenes with various moving objects. Traditional methods for handling this task lack the ability to deal with unexpected objects not seen in the training set. Scene flow estimation provides a promising solution but is computationally intensive. Recent works attempt to combine semantic segmentation and motion prediction, but face a trade-off between performance. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional enhancement network, BE-STI, to improve motion prediction by leveraging accurate spatial semantic features. Through experiments, we demonstrate that semantic information positively impacts motion prediction. We introduce a semantic decoder and a temporal-enhanced spatial encoder to improve spatial understanding. We also propose a spatial-enhanced temporal encoder to capture motion clues. Our BE-STI framework surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset. Our contributions include exploring the benefits of semantic information on motion prediction, introducing novel modules for bidirectional enhancement, and achieving remarkable performance improvements.
