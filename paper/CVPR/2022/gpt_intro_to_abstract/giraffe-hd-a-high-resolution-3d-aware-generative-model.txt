Image generation algorithms aim to achieve both image realism and controllability. While existing style-based GANs have been successful in generating photorealistic images, their lack of explicit 3D information limits the level of control over the generated content. On the other hand, 3D-aware generative models that incorporate 3D scene modeling and camera pose information enable better control but struggle with high-resolution image generation due to computational constraints.The current state-of-the-art 3D-aware generative model, GIRAFFE, separates foreground and background as separate 3D objects and uses volume rendering and a neural renderer to generate image content. Although GIRAFFE provides controllability over foreground objects, its neural renderer has limitations in terms of resolution and global scene properties. Thus, GIRAFFE can only generate images up to a resolution of 2562.In this paper, we propose a two-stage style-based 3D-aware generative model that combines the controllability of GIRAFFE with high-quality, high-resolution image generation up to 10242 resolution. By replacing GIRAFFE's neural renderer with a style-based neural renderer, we achieve high-resolution image generation while preserving control over foreground object properties. However, using the style renderer introduces entanglement between foreground and background features.To address this, we generate the foreground and background independently using two different style-based renderers and ensure compatibility between the two through geometric and photometric constraints. Additionally, we exploit the layer-wise control properties of StyleGAN to disentangle color and shape.Our proposed approach, GIRAFFE HD, retains GIRAFFE's 3D controllability while significantly improving image resolution and quality. We validate our approach on multiple natural image datasets and demonstrate better foreground-background disentanglement and image realism compared to GIRAFFE in higher resolution domains. Ablation studies are conducted to justify the design choices made in our model.
