Learning actions from long and untrimmed procedural videos has gained attention in the field of video understanding. While fully-supervised methods require dense annotation of training videos with framewise action labels, weakly-supervised methods learn from weak labels in the form of action transcripts or sets. Set-supervised action learning, which deals with action sets and their orderings, presents challenges in finding temporal regions of actions during training. Prior works in this area often involve generating action transcripts and pseudo-labels, which can be costly and result in slower training and inference speeds. Additionally, these methods may not capture the ordering between actions or similar transcripts of training videos for each task. This paper proposes a temporal attention-based method for set-supervised action learning, leveraging the similarity of action orderings for each task. The method introduces a new loss function called Pairwise Ordering Consistency (POC) loss, which encourages attention predictions to follow the same ordering across videos. The POC loss addresses limitations of existing alignment approaches and is differentiable, scalable to large training sets, and enables feature learning. The proposed method outperforms existing set-supervised algorithms and can also be effectively applied to transcript-supervised action learning.
