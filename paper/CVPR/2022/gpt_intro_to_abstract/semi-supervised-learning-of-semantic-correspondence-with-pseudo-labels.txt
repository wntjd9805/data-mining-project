Establishing dense correspondences across semantically similar images is crucial for various Computer Vision applications, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and image editing. While dense correspondence problems like stereo matching or optical flow have been extensively studied, semantic correspondence poses additional challenges due to large intra-class appearance and geometric variations. Recent approaches have focused on designing deep neural networks, such as CNNs or Transformers, to address these challenges. However, most existing methods rely on ground-truth correspondences, which can be subjective and sparse. Some methods have introduced self-supervised learning frameworks using synthetic image pairs, but they fail to account for extreme intra-class appearance variations. Weakly-supervised learning frameworks, which cast the task as feature reconstruction, have also been explored but struggle to handle severely different instances within the same class. Semi-supervised learning frameworks, popular in image classification, have shown promising results by leveraging consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. However, directly applying these techniques to semantic correspondence is challenging due to the need for pixel-level pseudo-labels. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning framework, called SemiMatch, for semantic correspondence. SemiMatch generates pixel-level pseudo-labels using the model's prediction and encourages the model to predict the pseudo-labels with increased confidence. A confidence measure for pseudo-labels is introduced, considering object-centric foreground, forward-backward consistency, and probability uncertainty. Additionally, a matching-specialized augmentation technique is proposed to enhance feature representations around keypoints. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SemiMatch in improving performance compared to state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence. The paper also includes an extensive ablation study to analyze and validate the components of the learning framework.
