This paper introduces the Efﬁcient Neural Radiance Fields (EfﬁcientNeRF) method, which aims to accelerate both the training and testing phases of Novel View Synthesis (NVS) tasks. Previous methods have focused on improving one phase at the expense of the other. EfﬁcientNeRF achieves competitive accuracy while reducing training time by over 88% and increasing rendering speed to over 200 frames per second. The authors propose two key techniques: Valid Sampling and Pivotal Sampling. Valid Sampling maintains dense voxels and updates density in an online way with momentum, allowing the coarse stage to only infer valid samples, which saves time. Pivotal Sampling is used in the fine stage to efficiently sample points by focusing on the nearby area of pivotal samples. This significantly decreases the number of sampled points while maintaining accuracy.During testing, the authors introduce a novel tree-based data structure called NerfTree that efficiently represents 3D scenes. NerfTree consists of two layers: coarse dense voxels and fine sparse voxels, allowing for fast inference speed.The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) the introduction of EfﬁcientNeRF, the first method to significantly accelerate both training and testing of NeRF-based methods while maintaining reasonable accuracy; 2) the novel techniques of Valid Sampling and Pivotal Sampling, which reduce computation and training time by over 88%; and 3) the design of NerfTree, a simple and efficient data structure that improves rendering speed by 4,000+ times.
