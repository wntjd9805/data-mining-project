Federated learning (FL) has gained attention in recent years as a way to train machine learning models on distributed datasets while preserving data privacy. FL has been successfully applied in various domains, including medical image diagnosis, image classification, and object detection. However, existing FL methods have limitations, such as the requirement for fully labeled images on each client and the lack of consideration for non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data among clients.Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) has emerged as a new research topic aiming to utilize unlabeled images to enhance the global model development. Two approaches have been explored in FSSL: considering partially labeled and unlabeled images on each client, or considering fully labeled and unlabeled clients. However, these methods have not effectively addressed the challenges of Non-IID data and potential information leakage.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel FSSL method called Random Sampling Consensus Federated learning (RSCFed). RSCFed considers the uneven reliability among models from fully-labeled and fully-unlabeled clients or from partially-labeled clients under the Non-IID setting without information leakage. RSCFed introduces a Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)-inspired approach to distill multiple sub-consensus models from randomly sampled local clients. A Distance-Reweighted Model Aggregation (DMA) module is used to dynamically adjust the weights of each sampled local client based on their proximity to the sub-consensus model.Extensive experiments on natural image classification datasets and a medical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of RSCFed. Compared to existing FSSL methods, RSCFed outperforms them significantly, especially when a larger ratio of unlabeled data is involved. The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of RSCFed as a novel FSSL method, the proposal of the DMA module to improve sub-consensus models, and the empirical demonstration of RSCFed's superiority over other state-of-the-art FSSL methods.
