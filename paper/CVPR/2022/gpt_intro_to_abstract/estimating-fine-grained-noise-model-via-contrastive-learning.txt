Image denoising is a crucial problem in computer vision, particularly in the context of real photographs captured by consumer-level cameras and mobile devices. While previous works have achieved impressive results in removing noise under the assumption of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), these methods do not perform as well on real photos due to the distribution gap between the noise assumption and the actual sensor noise. To address this issue, researchers have focused on real noise removal and have proposed solutions to model the sensor noise distribution and generate more realistic data. These methods involve statistical noise models or deep generative models like GANs and Normalizing Flow. However, existing noise modeling methods typically require calibration frames or pairs of noisy and clean images specific to a particular camera, which may not always be available.Another significant challenge in image denoising is noise estimation, which is essential for both filter-based and deep learning-based denoising approaches. While various techniques have been proposed for noise estimation, they are often based on inferior noise models like AWGN and are not suitable for more complex sensor noise patterns. Additionally, these methods have not exploited the intrinsic attributes of the camera sensor through the estimated parameters.To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel pipeline for noise model estimation and synthesis that can estimate parameters for fine-grained noise models using only testing data, eliminating the need for camera-specific training data or calibration. The proposed pipeline consists of a contrastive noise estimation model that can estimate noise parameters from a single image under fine-grained noise models. This estimation framework separates each noise component and accurately approximates the noise parameters, even for unseen camera models. With the estimated parameters, the pipeline can estimate the joint distribution of an unknown sensor under a state-of-the-art physical noise model, thus facilitating the training process for deep denoisers by synthesizing more realistic data. The main contributions of this work include the development of a noise model estimation and synthesis pipeline that can estimate camera noise models using only testing data, the use of a contrastive learning-based noise estimation framework for fine-grained parameter approximation, and the introduction of a camera-specific noise synthesis pipeline that generates promising synthetic noisy images without the need for sophisticated capturing schemes or real noisy/clean images.
