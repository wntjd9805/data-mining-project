This paper focuses on the study of Trojan attacks, which are a common threat model for data security. The authors aim to examine the relationship between model sparsity and train-time robustness against Trojan attacks. They leverage the concept of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and propose the idea of a "winning Trojan ticket" to uncover the pruning dynamics of a Trojan model. They establish the connection between model sparsity and Trojan attacks through iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) based on LTH. The authors reveal the existence of a winning Trojan ticket that retains the same Trojan attack effectiveness as the unpruned model. They propose a linear mode connectivity (LMC)-based Trojan score to detect this winning ticket. Additionally, they demonstrate that the backdoor feature encoded in the winning ticket can be used for reverse engineering of Trojan attacks without access to clean training data or threat model information. The effectiveness of their proposal is demonstrated through experiments using various poisoned deep neural networks (DNNs) and different Trojan trigger patterns across multiple network architectures and datasets. Overall, their method achieves significant improvements in Trojan attack performance estimation and recovery compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
