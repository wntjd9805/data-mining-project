With the advancement of deep neural networks, there has been a surge in AI-powered applications and services. However, improving performance often comes at the cost of increased model size and computation. Therefore, there has been a growing interest in developing lightweight and computation-efficient network designs that can be used for on-device inference to prioritize user experience and privacy.Although various neural network architectures have been proposed for efficiency, they still predominantly rely on traditional convolutional operators such as vanilla convolution (conv) and depthwise convolution. These operators lack the ability to adapt to different positions within an image and require the learning of multiple filters for feature matching. This leads to unnecessary computation for tasks that have a specific layout.For layout-specific tasks, where there is large intra-image variance but small cross-image variance, these traditional operators fall short. Examples of such tasks include face recognition, industrial product defects detection, and medical image processing. To address this limitation, a new operator called TVConv is proposed. TVConv is translation variant and can be shared across images, making it an efficient operator for layout-aware visual processing. It improves performance by reducing computational complexity and achieving high accuracy.Experimental results on face recognition show that replacing prevalent operators with TVConv reduces theoretical complexity by up to 3.1 times and accelerates throughput by 2.3 times while maintaining accuracy. Under extreme low complexity constraints, TVConv boosts mean accuracy by up to 4.21%. Additionally, TVConv demonstrates better generalization ability for optic disc/cup segmentation, which helps address the data scarcity challenge in medical image analysis.In summary, this paper presents three contributions: (1) a rethinking of existing convolution variants in the context of layout-specific tasks, (2) the introduction of TVConv as an efficient operator for layout-aware visual processing, and (3) extensive experiments showcasing the improved efficiency and generalization ability of TVConv for face recognition and medical image processing.
