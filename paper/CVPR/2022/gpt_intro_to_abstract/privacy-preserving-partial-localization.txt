This paper addresses the privacy concerns associated with cloud-based localization and mapping systems used in mixed reality and robotics. These systems rely on camera images as the primary sensory information, making privacy protection a critical issue. Previous works have proposed privacy-preserving representations of maps, but they have limitations in terms of susceptibility to attacks and the potential leak of the user's precise location. In this paper, a new method is presented that focuses on protecting the user's location while disregarding the protection of the scene appearance. The method involves sending a 3D query point cloud to the server, accepting the potential privacy risks associated with it. The method also takes into account that not all applications require full 6 degree of freedom (DoF) pose estimation. Many localization tasks, such as navigation for autonomous driving, only require a restricted manifold, such as the ground plane. To address these needs, the paper proposes a map representation using parallel planes instead of randomly oriented lines. By only observing the motion orthogonal to these planes, the pose estimate can be determined with reduced pose information. Multiple partial queries in different directions can be combined to obtain a 2D or full 3D pose. To maintain query privacy, the partial maps can be distributed to different service providers that cannot associate corresponding queries. The paper provides a practical example of a theme park using this method to provide AR localization to its guests. The park creates the plane maps and distributes them to independent cloud service providers to ensure privacy. Co-registration can also be hindered client-side by submitting temporally or spatially disjoint queries. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed method offers stronger guarantees on privacy preservation, the first location privacy in image-based localization, and only minor accuracy and recall trade-offs. The paper concludes by highlighting the contributions and practical relevance of the work, emphasizing its potential to enable widespread adoption of cloud localization services in mixed reality and robotics.
