RawNeRF is a modified version of neural radiance fields (NeRF) that reconstructs scenes in linear HDR color space by directly supervising on noisy raw input images. This approach bypasses the lossy post-processing applied by cameras to compress dynamic range and smooth out noise in order to produce visually pleasing images. By preserving the full dynamic range of the raw inputs, RawNeRF enables various novel HDR view synthesis tasks such as modifying exposure level and tonemapping algorithm, and creating synthetically refocused images with accurately rendered bokeh effects. Additionally, training directly on raw data turns RawNeRF into a multi-image denoiser capable of reconstructing scenes captured in near-darkness. The method takes advantage of NeRF's ability to reduce variance by aggregating information across frames, resulting in clean reconstructions from many noisy raw inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that RawNeRF outperforms NeRF on noisy real and synthetic datasets and is a competitive multi-image denoiser for wide-baseline static scenes. The proposed method has implications for training view synthesis models on high dynamic range scenes and handling noisy inputs captured in low-light conditions.
