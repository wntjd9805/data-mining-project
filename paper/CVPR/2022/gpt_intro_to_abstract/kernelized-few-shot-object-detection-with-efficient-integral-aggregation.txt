In this paper, we address the problem of few-shot object detection (FSOD) and propose a novel feature representation that leverages the expressiveness and regularization capabilities of kernels. We introduce the Integral Region-of-Interest Aggregation (IRA) scheme for fast kernelization and further accelerate it using count sketching, a dimensionality reduction technique. We equip our network with MLP units to learn the kernel hyper-parameters and partially whiten matrices using Spectral Power Normalization. Additionally, we redesign a Multi-head Relation Network to combine the spatially-ordered features with the kernelized representations. We highlight the advantages of RKHS kernelization in FSOD, including its ability to capture non-linear relationships, factor out spatial order, control model complexity, and combine shift-variant and average pooled representations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
