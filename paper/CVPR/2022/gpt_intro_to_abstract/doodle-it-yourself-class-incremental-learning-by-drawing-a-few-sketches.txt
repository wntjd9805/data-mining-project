Abstract: Fully supervised learning has shown significant progress in object classification tasks, particularly on curated datasets like ImageNet. However, this progress is limited to a small number of object classes with explicitly labeled data. To address this limitation, Class Incremental Learning (CIL) has been proposed, with Few-Shot CIL (FSCIL) being the most realistic approach that mimics how humans learn new classes with limited examples. This paper introduces a DIY-FSCIL framework that leverages human sketches as support modality for learning new classes. Unlike conventional approaches that rely only on photos, sketches offer a flexible and cross-modal approach, allowing for creativity and addressing practical constraints related to privacy and copyright. The paper highlights the advantages of using sketches over text and explores the challenges of utilizing sketches in the FSCIL setting. Three design considerations, including cross-modal model integration, knowledge retention, and improved decision boundary generation, are addressed. The contributions of this work include extending incremental learning research towards practicality and human-likeness, introducing sketches as class support for FSCIL, and presenting the first cross-modal framework for the DIY-FSCIL problem.
