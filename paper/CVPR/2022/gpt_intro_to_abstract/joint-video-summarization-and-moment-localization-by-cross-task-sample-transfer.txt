In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for video summarization that leverages the task of video moment localization to address the problem of limited annotated video summaries. Video summarization, which extracts representative segments from untrimmed videos, has gained considerable attention in recent years. Previous methods in video summarization have relied on hand-crafted heuristics but have been surpassed by deep learning techniques empowered by recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms.While supervised learning has shown performance gains in video summarization, the scarcity of large-scale annotated video summaries remains a challenge. Weakly-supervised approaches have been proposed but struggle to achieve competitive results. To address this, we explore the concept of cross-task sample transfer from the related task of video moment localization. Video moment localization aims to identify the video segments corresponding to a given sentence query.We observe that video summarization and moment localization are correlated tasks, as video summaries can be seen as a sparse, redundancy-free version of the video moments. This insight motivates us to develop a collaborative optimization scheme for these two tasks. However, achieving satisfactory cross-task sample transfer is non-trivial due to the domain gap and susceptibility to batch noise.To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel collaborative teaching network called iPTNet. It includes a video summarization module, a moment localization module, an importance propagation module, and a collaborative teaching module. The importance propagation module connects the frame-wise importance maps generated by the two modules, enabling cross-task sample transfer. The collaborative teaching module implements a mean teaching strategy to mitigate error amplification during joint training.Our contributions include utilizing a second correlated task (video moment localization) with sufficient training data to improve video summarization, designing an importance propagation algorithm for cross-task sample transfer, and proposing a collaborative teaching scheme to prevent error amplification. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that iPTNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video summarization. The code and data for this work have been made available to support further research.
