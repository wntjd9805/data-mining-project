With the increasing availability of remote sensing data from satellites, there is a need for efficient processing of both multi-spectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images to obtain high-resolution images with rich spectral information. Existing pan-sharpening methods have focused on either image-level fusion or feature-level fusion, but they fail to explicitly capture the complementary information between the two modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance and artifacts in the fused images. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel mutual information-driven pan-sharpening framework that enforces complementary feature learning and reduces information redundancy. The proposed framework consists of a cascaded process in which the MS and PAN images are fed into separate convolution branches to obtain modality-aware features. Mutual information minimization is then imposed on these features to encourage complementary information learning. Low-dimensional feature vectors are calculated using both current-layer modality features and previous-layer immediate-process features, effectively reducing information redundancy.A post-fusion module equipped with invertible neural networks is used to project the refined features back to the expected MS images. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, with excellent generalization ability to real-world scenes. Ablation studies also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed components.The contributions of this work include the design of a novel pan-sharpening framework based on mutual information minimization, explicitly encouraging multi-modal learning between MS and PAN modalities. The proposed model reduces information redundancy and mitigates artifacts in pan-sharpened images. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of the proposed algorithm over other existing methods for satellite image fusion.
