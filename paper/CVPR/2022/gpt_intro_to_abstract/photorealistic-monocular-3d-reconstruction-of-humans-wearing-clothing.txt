PHORHUM is a novel method for photorealistically reconstructing the 3D geometry and appearance of a dressed person from a single RGB image. This technique addresses the increasing demand for 3D scans of people wearing clothing, which have various applications in fields such as immersive AR and VR, games, telepresence, virtual try-on, and creative image editing. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on multi-camera setups or manual artist creation, PHORHUM offers a cheaper and easier-to-deploy automatic solution.Previous research has focused on human digitization from a single image but has several limitations. These methods often produce appearance estimates with baked-in shading effects or lack color information entirely, limiting their usability in virtual scenes. Additionally, many approaches rely on multi-step pipelines and intermediate representations, which are impractical and may not provide accurate geometry for certain applications.PHORHUM aims to overcome these shortcomings by providing an end-to-end solution that predicts geometry and appearance in a single step without the need for image matting. It simultaneously computes surface color and shading, allowing for realistic placement of the scans in virtual scenes. The system also estimates scene illumination, which can be used for reshading, compositing, and other applications.To improve the perceptual quality of the reconstruction, PHORHUM introduces rendering losses that enhance the visual fidelity of the predicted appearance. The contributions of this work include the presentation of an end-to-end trainable system for high-quality human digitization, the computation of albedo and shading information, and the significant improvement in visual fidelity through rendering losses.Compared to state-of-the-art methods, PHORHUM produces more accurate and detailed results, making it a promising technique for 3D human reconstruction from single images. It outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstructed surface properties, 3D geometry quality, and overall visual fidelity.
