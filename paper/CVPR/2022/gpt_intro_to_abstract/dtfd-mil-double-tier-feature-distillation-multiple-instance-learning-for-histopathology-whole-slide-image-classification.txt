The automation of whole slide images (WSIs) presents a challenge for computer vision in the field of digital pathology. WSIs are widely used in histopathology and have large sizes, making it difficult to apply existing machine learning techniques directly. Deep learning models require large-scale datasets and high-quality annotations, which is burdensome for WSIs. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) has been applied to WSI classification, but it is challenging due to the limited number of slide-level labels and the problem of overfitting. Recent works have explored the use of mutual-instance relations to address these challenges. However, existing methods do not explicitly address the issues specific to WSIs. In this paper, we propose a double-tier MIL framework that introduces the concept of pseudo-bags to increase the number of bags and alleviate the limited number of WSIs. We derive the instance probability under the MIL framework using Grad-CAM, and demonstrate the superiority of our approach on two large histopathology WSI datasets.
