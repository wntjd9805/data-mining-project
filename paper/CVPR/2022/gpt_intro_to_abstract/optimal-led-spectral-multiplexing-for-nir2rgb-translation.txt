A visual surveillance system aims to capture high-quality images continuously throughout the day. However, changes in ambient illumination can greatly affect the appearance of images. While cameras function well during the daytime under sufficient daylight, they struggle under low-light conditions. Additional illumination is commonly used to enhance image quality, but it may introduce motion blur and reveal the surveillance coverage, which is undesirable. Near-infrared (NIR) LEDs have been used for night-time surveillance, taking advantage of the camera's silicon sensor's sensitivity in the NIR band to obtain visual information in the absence of visible light. However, images captured with NIR LEDs still suffer from a loss of color and texture information. This is attributed to the overlap in camera spectral sensitivity of the RGB channels around the NIR band, making it difficult to record color accurately, and the indistinguishability of reflectance spectra beyond 850nm. Previous works have attempted to recover RGB directly from NIR images, but the quality of the recovered images is limited due to the ambiguous mapping between NIR and RGB. In this paper, we propose a method to retrieve the optimal LED multiplexing for more accurate NIR2RGB restoration. We establish two criteria based on camera imaging principles: maximizing the number of distinguished colors and minimizing the NIR2RGB reconstruction error. Through deep learning, we minimize the reconstruction loss and obtain the optimal LED spectral multiplexing. This work contributes a novel perspective on robustifying the NIR2RGB translation task by engineering the illumination multiplexing of existing NIR LEDs. Two optimization schemes are proposed, and a Hyperspectral Images dataset named IDH is collected and released, simulating night surveillance imaging. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality RGB images.
