Temporal Action Localization (TAL) is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in video classification, video captioning, and video editing. This problem involves localizing temporal boundaries of actions in untrimmed videos. Despite significant progress in recent years, TAL still faces challenges such as large scale variation and ambiguous definition of action boundaries.Existing approaches for TAL primarily rely on discretized anchoring representations, which limits their ability to be trained in an end-to-end manner. Some methods use pre-defined temporal anchors, while others leverage anchor-free representations. Each representation method has its strengths and weaknesses in terms of localization accuracy and efficiency.To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel continuous anchoring representation method for TAL. This representation allows for precise segment extraction by directly regressing confidence scores from continuous anchor points. The proposed approach, called Recurrent Continuous Localization (RCL), utilizes video embeddings and temporal coordinates to improve action detection accuracy. RCL can be integrated into existing TAL frameworks, resulting in significant improvements in performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.The key contributions of this paper are: (1) the introduction of a continuous anchoring representation method that unifies and extends existing anchor-based detectors, (2) the development of an effective scale-invariant sampling strategy to optimize the continuous representation, (3) an iterative optimization method that focuses on the target region and provides refined estimations, and (4) state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets (THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3), achieving mAP scores of 52.92% and 37.65%, respectively.Overall, this paper addresses the limitations of existing TAL methods by proposing a continuous anchoring representation method that significantly improves action detection accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.
