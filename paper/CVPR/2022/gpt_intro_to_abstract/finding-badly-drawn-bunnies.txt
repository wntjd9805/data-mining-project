This paper addresses the problem of quantifying sketch quality and proposes a learnable metric for evaluating the quality of sketches. The authors introduce a novel solution called GACL (Geometry-Aware Classification Layer) that utilizes the feature space geometry underlying a recognition task to determine the quality of a sketch. By redefining the Softmax formulation and incorporating quality score as feature magnitude, GACL ensures that the better the quality of a sketch, the closer its feature is to the class centre. The authors conduct human studies to validate the ordering of the quality scores learned under GACL. Additionally, the practical implications of modeling sketch quality are demonstrated through three applications: quality-aware sketch recognition, quality-guided sketch generation, and quality-enabled sketch attribution. Overall, this paper provides a pioneering approach to quantifying sketch quality without relying on human quality annotations, contributing to various facets of sketch research.
