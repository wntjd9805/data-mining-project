In recent years, deep learning methods have significantly improved the performance of algorithms in computer vision tasks. Convolution neural networks (CNNs), in particular, have been utilized for their powerful feature extraction capabilities. Researchers have explored different approaches to enhance the convolution operation for improved performance and efficiency. These approaches include reducing connectivity in the channel or space, increasing the freedom of kernel shape or value, and generating dynamic weights based on inputs. Some studies have also incorporated multi-scale features into convolution. However, these existing methods have not effectively addressed the electrical synapses among close neurons, which play a crucial role in coordinating neighboring neurons for visual perception. In this paper, we propose a novel method called "convolution of convolution" (CoC) to model the spatial associations among kernels within a layer, allowing them to collaborate and improve feature extraction. CoC can seamlessly replace existing convolution layers and offers performance gains during testing. The contributions of this research include introducing the CoC method, exploring its hyper-parameter optimization, and evaluating its performance on various backbone architectures and vision tasks.
