This paper introduces a novel approach to generative modeling by leveraging pretrained deep feature extractors from computer vision models. The authors explore the potential implications of using computer vision systems to improve image synthesis models. They observe that state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) are trained in an unsupervised manner without utilizing pretrained networks, missing an opportunity for improvement. The authors propose using a "bank" of pretrained networks as a discriminator in GAN training, with the pretrained network frozen and a lightweight classifier added on top. They demonstrate that this approach provides stable training and reduces overfitting. Additionally, they propose an automatic model selection strategy based on linear separability in the feature space and progressively add supervision from pretrained networks. The effectiveness of their method is evaluated on multiple datasets with both limited and large-scale samples, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric. The authors also visualize the internal representation of their models and provide access to their code and complete paper.
