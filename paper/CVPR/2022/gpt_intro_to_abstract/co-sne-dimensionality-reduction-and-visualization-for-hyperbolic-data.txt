Datasets with hierarchical structures are commonly found in various domains, such as social networks and complex networks. Euclidean space is inadequate for embedding entities in such datasets without distortion. Hyperbolic space, which has a constant negative curvature, has been widely used for embedding hierarchical data. It closely approximates the tree metric and has been utilized in the representation learning of word embeddings and visual inputs. Additionally, several algorithms operate directly on hyperbolic space. Higher embedding dimensions generally result in better hyperbolic representation quality, but learning with two-dimensional hyperbolic space is more prevalent due to ease of visualization.The Poincaré ball model is often used to represent hyperbolic space, as it allows for easy visualization of two-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings within a unit Euclidean circle. However, visualizing high-dimensional hyperbolic data is challenging, as most visualization methods assume the data to exist in Euclidean space.Embeddings in the Poincaré ball model possess two important properties: a global hierarchical structure and a local similarity structure. However, popular visualization tools like t-SNE and HoroPCA fail to preserve both the global hierarchy and local similarity of hyperbolic embeddings. In this paper, we propose CO-SNE, an approach that can preserve both structures in a low-dimensional hyperbolic space.We demonstrate the effectiveness of CO-SNE by visualizing embeddings of a mammal subtree from WordNet in a five-dimensional hyperbolic space. CO-SNE successfully preserves the structure of the data.To preserve the local similarity structure, we adopt the same idea as in t-SNE. We minimize the KL-divergence between high-dimensional similarities and low-dimensional similarities, using hyperbolic versions of the normal distribution and Cauchy distribution for computing similarities. To maintain the global hierarchical structure, we introduce a distance loss function that aims to preserve the individual distances of high-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings to the Origin in low-dimensional hyperbolic space.In summary, our contributions include the proposal of CO-SNE, which can represent high-dimensional datapoints in a low-dimensional hyperbolic space while preserving local similarity and the global hierarchical structure. We also propose using the hyperbolic Cauchy distribution for computing low-dimensional similarities, which is crucial for producing good visualizations in hyperbolic space. We apply CO-SNE to visualize different types of hyperbolic data and demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods.
