Three-dimensional point cloud registration is a well-studied problem in computer science, focusing on estimating a single transformation between two point clouds. However, there is a less investigated problem of estimating multiple transformations between point clouds, which arises when finding the poses of objects within a target point cloud. This problem, referred to as multi-instance point cloud registration, presents unique challenges in identifying different clusters of corresponding points belonging to different object instances. Existing solutions involve training object detectors or segmentation networks, which are limited to specific objects or classes. Alternatively, multi-model fitting methods require a large number of sampling steps, reducing efficiency and robustness when dealing with a high number of objects or outliers.In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust solution to the multi-instance point cloud registration problem. The key idea is to group corresponding points into clusters based on a distance invariance matrix. This matrix is constructed by evaluating the distance consistency between pairwise correspondences obtained through feature matching. By analyzing the row or column vectors of the matrix, we can identify the correspondences belonging to specific instances. A simple clustering algorithm is then applied to divide the correspondences into cliques, which are further refined through recursive steps. Inliers and outliers of each instance are automatically identified using a ranking strategy.Our method eliminates the need for time-consuming hypothesis sampling, resulting in high efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and speed. We propose three metrics, Mean Hit Recall, Mean Hit Precision, and Mean Hit F1, to fully evaluate the performance of multi-instance point cloud registration. Moreover, our solution shows potential for zero-shot detection of 3D objects, as observed in our real-world tests.In summary, our contributions include an efficient and robust solution to the multi-instance point cloud registration problem, achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and speed. We introduce three metrics for comprehensive evaluation and highlight the potential use of our solution in zero-shot detection of 3D objects.
