Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular paradigm in deep learning that involves training models on pretext tasks to extract useful information from the data. These pretrained models are then used to perform downstream tasks. However, existing SSL models do not generalize well across a diverse range of downstream tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach called Multi-SSL that combines multiple SSL tasks to create a more generic model. The paper reviews the literature on SSL in various domains such as language, sound, and vision. It highlights the need for generic models that can perform well on diverse downstream tasks. The authors propose Multi-SSL as a solution to this problem, which combines multiple SSL tasks to create a more generalized model. The paper focuses on binaural sound representation learning and visual representation learning as two specific domains.For binaural sound representation learning, the authors propose three SSL tasks: spatial alignment, foreground alignment, and temporal gap prediction. These tasks are trained on the OmniAudio dataset and evaluated on downstream tasks such as video retrieval, auditory semantic prediction, and spatial sound super resolution.For visual representation learning, the authors consider two SSL tasks: contrastive learning at the global image feature level and dense contrastive learning at the local feature level. These tasks are trained on the ImageNet dataset and evaluated on downstream tasks such as image classification and object detection.The paper also proposes different methods for combining multiple SSL tasks, including concatenation, multi-task learning, ProgressiveNet, and Incremental Learning (IL). Experimental results show that all the Multi-SSL methods improve upon single SSL tasks and outperform supervised models. The IL approach performs the best among the Multi-SSL methods.In summary, the contributions of this paper include proposing SSL approaches for binaural sound representation learning, introducing Multi-SSL methods for combining multiple SSL tasks, and training and evaluating Multi-SSL for image representation learning. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Multi-SSL approach in improving performance on downstream tasks.
