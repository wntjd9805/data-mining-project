Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their degraded low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Existing approaches utilize deep vision architectures to extract feature maps and then upsample to HR images at the end of a network. However, these methods require training and storing multiple models for each scale factor, which becomes impractical for upsampling with sub-pixel convolution. In contrast, arbitrary-scale SR methods offer promising solutions by enabling image restoration in a continuous manner using a single network. Implicit neural functions, parameterized by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), have shown remarkable performance in representing continuous-domain signals, including images. Inspired by these advances, this paper proposes a Local Texture Estimator (LTE) to allow an implicit function to learn fine details while restoring images in arbitrary resolutions. The LTE estimates dominant frequencies and Fourier coefficients for natural images, which are essential for characterizing image textures. The study demonstrates that an implicit representation function for arbitrary resolution prioritizes learning high-frequency details when using the LTE. Furthermore, the computation time of the LTE is investigated at various memory conditions, showing that the proposed approach is faster compared to previous works. The main contributions of this paper include highlighting the capability of a deep SR network followed by the LTE to estimate dominant frequencies and Fourier coefficients, demonstrating the priority of high-frequency detail learning in implicit representations, and evaluating the computation time efficiency of the LTE.
