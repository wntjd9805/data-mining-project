Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have become a popular paradigm for generating and manipulating images and videos. The success of GANs has led to various applications in computer graphics and visual content generation. However, most existing GAN models are limited in their ability to generate images with unseen translations and scales. Recent research has shown that convolutional GANs learn positional priors through imperfect positional encodings. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new positional encoding formulation and a means of enforcing consistency between different scales and resolutions using inter-scale augmentations in the discriminator. The proposed approach allows for arbitrary continuous scale generation with consistency across scales and resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline enables consistent generation of images with arbitrary scales while maintaining high visual quality.
