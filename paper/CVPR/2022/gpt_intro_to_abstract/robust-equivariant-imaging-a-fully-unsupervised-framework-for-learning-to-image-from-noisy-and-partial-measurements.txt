Inverse problems are essential in computer vision and signal processing, particularly in applications such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), super-resolution, and image inpainting. These problems involve reconstructing a signal x from measurements y, which requires inverting the forward process y = A(x) + ϵ. This task is challenging due to noise ϵ and ill-conditioned or rank-deficient forward operators A. Traditional approaches use prior knowledge about x to regularize the reconstructions. Recent end-to-end learning solutions aim to learn the inverse mapping directly from (x, y) pairs, but obtaining clean signals x for training is often expensive or impossible.Learning the reconstruction mapping solely from partial measurements is fundamentally impossible without assumptions on the signal distribution. Unsupervised methods employing multiple forward operators are rarely encountered in practice. The EI framework demonstrated that learning from partial measurements is possible when the underlying signal set is invariant to transformations. However, the performance of EI deteriorates significantly in the presence of measurement noise.This paper proposes a novel robust EI (REI) framework that learns from noisy measurements. Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) is utilized to derive an unsupervised loss that accounts for the noise in the measurements. The REI method is architecture agnostic and capable of handling various noise models, such as Gaussian, Poisson, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Experimental results show that REI outperforms vanilla EI in three inverse problems: sparse-view CT, accelerated MRI, and image inpainting. This work contributes by presenting an unsupervised learning framework for training deep networks to solve imaging problems from noisy partial measurements, accommodating a wide range of frequently encountered noise models, and achieving improvements over vanilla EI in the presence of noise.
