Abstract:Novel view synthesis using neural radiance fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention in computer vision and graphics. Although NeRF provides realistic rendering, it lacks the ability for users to modify or edit scene objects. In contrast, explicit representations, such as mesh, allow for easy editing but are challenging to obtain accurately for real-world scenes. This paper addresses the challenge by exploring the editing of implicit representations like NeRF. Previous works have proposed methods for editing NeRF but are limited in their ability to perform substantial shape modifications. This paper presents a method for editing neural radiance fields by combining the advantages of explicit and implicit representations. The proposed method allows users to perform user-controlled shape deformation and achieve photorealistic rendering from novel viewpoints. To enable shape deformation, an explicit mesh representation is extracted from the NeRF and intuitively deformed by the user. A tetrahedral mesh is then built based on the deformed triangular mesh, facilitating the propagation of deformation and enabling realistic rendering. This approach is not limited to specific shapes and can be applied to various objects, including animals and man-made objects. The proposed method provides a novel and efficient way of editing neural radiance fields while maintaining realistic rendering effects.
