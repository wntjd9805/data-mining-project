The aim of this paper is to propose a novel framework called SphereSR for super-resolving low-resolution (LR) 360◦ images to high-resolution (HR) images with an arbitrary projection type. Existing methods for omnidirectional image (ODI) super-resolution (SR) mainly focus on the equirectangular projection (ERP) format and do not consider the properties of 360◦ images. SphereSR addresses the ERP distortion issue and resolves pixel density differences according to the latitude. It also introduces a spherical local implicit image function (SLIIF) that can predict RGB values at arbitrary coordinates on a spherical feature map. The method leverages a feature loss to measure the similarity between different projection types. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SphereSR outperforms existing methods in terms of performance. Overall, this paper contributes a novel framework, a feature extraction module, the SLIIF method, and significantly improved results in ODIs SR.
