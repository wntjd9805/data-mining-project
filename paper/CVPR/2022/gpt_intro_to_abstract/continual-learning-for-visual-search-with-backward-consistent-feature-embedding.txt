Continual learning (CL) is a rapidly evolving technology that aims to learn new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous sessions. However, most research in CL focuses on image classification and neglects the demand for image retrieval. In order to achieve powerful feature representations in image retrieval, current approaches still require training a model on an entire dataset simultaneously, rather than incrementally. This limitation hinders the development of practical visual search systems that can continually learn from new materials while consolidating old knowledge. To address this gap, we propose a novel CL approach called CVS (Continual-learner for Visual Search) for a general incremental setup in visual search. CVS learns effective feature representations with backward consistency, ensuring that newly learned features are compatible with existing gallery features. We introduce a cross-task gallery embedding consistency constraint and develop a metric-based knowledge distillation technique to maintain feature consistency while consolidating old knowledge. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of CVS in achieving continual visual search with backward-compatible feature embedding. The proposed approach tackles a general setting that considers both seen and unseen classes in new sessions, overcoming the limitations of previous disjoint and blurry setups. By learning discriminative features for unseen classes and maintaining the effectiveness of distance metrics in both new and old sessions, CVS achieves state-of-the-art results in visual search.
