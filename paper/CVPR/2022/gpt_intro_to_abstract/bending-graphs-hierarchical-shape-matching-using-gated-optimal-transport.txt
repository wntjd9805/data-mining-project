Deformable surfaces have been extensively studied in the computer graphics and computer vision communities. These surfaces are often represented as triangle meshes and dense correspondence estimation plays a crucial role in applications such as reconstruction and human pose estimation. The Functional Map framework has proven to be successful in finding correspondences between deformable shapes by expressing the pointwise correspondence as a linear map between functional bases defined on the shapes. Recent works have explored using learned point cloud features to describe local regions and integrating spectral manifold wavelets or iterative spectral upsampling into functional maps. However, many existing methods require numerous initial keypoints or are sensitive to sparse matches.While graph deep learning frameworks have been applied to extract features from meshes, limited works exist in this area. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to point clouds, but their application to meshes can capture local deformations. Furthermore, GNNs have been utilized to construct hierarchical representations, which are beneficial for various computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a graph-based descriptor designed for meshes that captures local surface structures by constructing edges on a mesh lattice graph. We incorporate a high-level shape graph to represent and interconnect shape regions, allowing for efficient processing of 3D meshes and learning rich shape representations.We address the problem of 3D deformable shape matching as an optimal transport problem. Optimal transport has gained popularity in feature matching and registration, and the differentiable Sinkhorn algorithm has been effective in learning-based feature matching. However, this solver does not work well in soft correspondence problems or when an exact matching is missing. To address this limitation, we propose a new strategy using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to propagate features using matching confidence in our shape graph, resulting in a more robust optimal transport solution.In summary, our contributions include the development of a graph-based descriptor for meshes that captures local surface structures, the incorporation of a high-level shape graph for efficient processing of 3D meshes and learning holistic shape representations, and the introduction of a strategy using GRUs to improve the robustness of optimal transport in deformable shape matching.
