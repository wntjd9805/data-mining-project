Three-dimensional object detection is a crucial task for various applications such as autonomous driving, robotic navigation, and augmented reality. Traditional methods for object detection from RGB-D data, such as sliding window or 2D prior approaches, struggle due to the unordered and sparse nature of point clouds. View-based methods project the points onto multiple 2D planes and apply 2D detectors, while volumetric convolution-based methods split points into regular grids for 3D convolutions. PointNet++ focuses on local geometries and is widely used as a backbone network in 3D detectors. VoteNet improves on PointNet++ by regressing offset votes to object centers. Other methods introduce probabilistic voting, multi-level contextual learning, and self-attention-based transformer to enhance local representations.However, these methods do not effectively handle the ambiguity in attributes of similar objects when considering only individual objects or their relations. This paper proposes HyperDet3D, a 3D object detection approach on point clouds that leverages a hypernetwork-based structure. Unlike existing methods, HyperDet3D learns scene-conditioned information as prior knowledge and incorporates scene-level knowledge into network parameters. This allows the object detector to dynamically adjust to different input scenes. The scene-conditioned knowledge is factorized into scene-agnostic and scene-specific information. The scene-agnostic knowledge is abstracted from training scenes and consumed by a hypernetwork during testing. The scene-specific information adapts the detector to the given scene at test time.To learn the two levels of scene-conditioned knowledge, a Multi-head Scene-Conditioned Attention (MSA) module is proposed. The learned prior knowledge is then fused with object candidate features to provide guidance for object detection. Experimental results on the Scan-Net and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate that HyperDet3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. Cross-dataset evaluation shows that the acquired scene-conditioned prior knowledge remains effective even in the presence of domain gaps. Overall, HyperDet3D improves 3D object detection by incorporating scene-level information and addressing the ambiguity in similar objects.
