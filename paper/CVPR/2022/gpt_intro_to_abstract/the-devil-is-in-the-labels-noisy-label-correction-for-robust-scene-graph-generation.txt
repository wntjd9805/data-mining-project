Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a fundamental task in visual scene understanding, which involves detecting object instances and their pairwise visual relations in an image. The current state-of-the-art models for SGG suffer from performance degradation on tail categories compared to head categories due to the imbalanced nature of the datasets. To mitigate this issue, existing solutions can be categorized into rebalancing strategies and biased-model-based strategies. However, these methods assume that all manually annotated positive samples are equally correct and that all un-annotated negative samples are background, which may not hold true in SGG datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic NoIsy label CorrEction strategy (NICE) to address these assumptions and reformulate SGG as a noisy label learning problem. NICE consists of three components: negative noisy sample detection, positive noisy sample detection, and noisy sample correction. We evaluate NICE on the Visual Genome benchmark and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalization abilities. Our contributions include providing insights into the limitations of existing assumptions in SGG, proposing a novel strategy for noisy label correction in SGG, and demonstrating the modular nature of NICE for improving SGG annotation qualities.
