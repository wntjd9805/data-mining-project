Abstract:In the field of computer graphics, generating realistic human motion is crucial for various applications such as movies, games, augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR), and the metaverse. Previous work on human motion generation has primarily focused on individual body parts, often neglecting the head and hands or considering them in isolation from the scene or objects. This paper introduces a novel approach called GOAL (Generating Object-interActing whole-body motions) that aims to address the challenge of generating whole-body avatars grasping objects by jointly considering the body, head, feet, hands, and objects.To achieve this, GOAL utilizes two networks: GNet, a conditional variational auto-encoder (cVAE), which generates a realistic whole-body grasp pose, and MNet, which inpaints the motion between the initial and goal poses in an auto-regressive manner. The GOAL framework takes as input a 3D object, its position and orientation, and a starting body pose near the object. It then generates a sequence of 3D body poses that lead to the grasping of the object. GOAL goes beyond existing work by inferring both SMPL-X parameters and 3D offsets to guide the grasping process. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the GRAB dataset, which contains examples of whole-body motion for object grasping. The performance of GOAL is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively on withheld portions of the GRAB dataset, demonstrating its ability to generate natural and realistic motions. Comparative analyses with baseline methods and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the major components of GOAL. A perceptual study further confirms that the generated motions by GOAL achieve a level of realism comparable to ground-truth motions from the GRAB dataset.This work contributes to the advancement of generating whole-body grasp motions for realistic avatars, opening avenues for further research and development in virtual human animation. The GOAL framework, along with the models and code, is made easily accessible to the research community.Keywords: virtual humans, motion generation, whole-body avatars, grasping objects, computer graphics.
