Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a technique that measures vital signs through the detection of light transmitted or reflected through the skin. Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG), which uses camera videos, offers advantages over traditional PPG methods such as non-contact measurement and no skin irritation. This makes rPPG suitable for a wide range of applications, including neonatal monitoring and telemedicine. However, traditional rPPG methods require preprocessing steps such as face tracking and skin segmentation. Recently, deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have gained popularity in rPPG research due to their ability to learn the mapping between pulse signals and color variations. However, the performance of data-driven rPPG networks is highly dependent on the quality of the dataset. To address this, efforts have been made to improve the performance of deep rPPG methods and mitigate demographic bias. Additionally, a new rPPG dataset called UCLA-rPPG, which includes diverse skin tones, has been released to facilitate research and benchmark performance across different demographic groups.
