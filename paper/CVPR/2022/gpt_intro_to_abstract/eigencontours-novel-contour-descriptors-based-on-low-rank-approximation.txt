Contour descriptors are crucial for object recognition, segmentation, and retrieval in computer vision applications. Previous contour descriptors have focused on representing object boundaries for image retrieval. These include simple metrics like area and circularity, as well as more advanced approaches like shape signatures and structural analysis. Recent advancements in contour descriptors have incorporated tracking and deep-learning-based object detection and segmentation systems.In this paper, we introduce a novel contour descriptor called eigencontours, which is based on low-rank approximation. We construct a contour matrix that contains the boundaries of all objects in a training set. The contour matrix is decomposed into eigencontours using singular value decomposition, and each contour is represented by a linear combination of these eigencontours. This allows for a more compact and faithful representation of object boundaries.We also incorporate the eigencontours into an instance segmentation framework. Experimental results show that the proposed eigencontours outperform existing contour descriptors in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, when integrated into the YOLOv3 framework, our algorithm achieves promising instance segmentation performances on various datasets.In summary, our contributions include the introduction of eigencontours as data-driven contour descriptors based on SVD, a more effective and efficient representation of object boundaries, and improved performance in instance segmentation compared to conventional contour-based techniques.
