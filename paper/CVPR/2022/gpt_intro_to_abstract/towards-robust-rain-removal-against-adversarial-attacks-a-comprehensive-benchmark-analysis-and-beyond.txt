Rain removal methods aim to remove the disruptive effects caused by rain streaks in order to restore a clean version of the image. While early model-driven approaches can handle light rain, they fall short in cases of heavy rain and often blur the background scenes. Deep learning-based deraining methods have emerged as the mainstream approach, offering better performance in terms of less remaining rain streaks and better preserved background scenes. However, there is a lack of research on the robustness of these methods against adversarial attacks, which can compromise the reliability and stability of subsequent applications. In this paper, we investigate, improve, and evaluate the robustness of deep learning-based rain removal methods against adversarial attacks. We analyze existing deraining methods in terms of their robustness against adversarial attacks and evaluate the impact of different modules and losses on robustness. Based on our analysis, we propose a more robust deraining method by integrating effective modules. We also explore various adversarial attack types and scenarios specific to rain removal degradation. This study aims to improve the performance and reliability of rain removal methods in practical applications such as video surveillance and autonomous driving.
