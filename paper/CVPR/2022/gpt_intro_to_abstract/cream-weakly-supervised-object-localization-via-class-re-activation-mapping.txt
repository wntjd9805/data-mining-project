Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) is a task that aims to localize objects belonging to a specific class in images using only image-level supervision. This approach significantly reduces the need for fine annotations, which can be labor-intensive. Previous works in WSOL have relied on training classification networks and using Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to determine the foreground region of the object. However, CAM only highlights the most discriminative regions, resulting in incomplete localization.To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Class RE-Activation Mapping (CREAM) for WSOL. CREAM addresses the problem of incomplete localization by considering the mixup of activation values between less discriminative foreground regions and the background. By introducing class-specific foreground and background context embeddings, CREAM is able to capture the common features of the foreground and background. During training, a momentum preservation strategy updates the context embeddings based on the guidance of CAM. These learned embeddings serve as initial cluster centroids for each class. During inference, re-activation mapping is formulated as a parameter estimation problem using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) framework. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) based soft-clustering algorithm is used to solve this problem. CREAM boosts the activation values of the integral object, improves the separation between foreground and background, and shows robustness to different threshold values.Experiments conducted on CUB, ILSVRC, and OpenImages datasets demonstrate that CREAM outperforms previous WSOL methods in terms of localization performance. Additionally, CREAM can be used as a plug-and-play method in existing WSOL approaches. In summary, the contributions of this paper include the proposal of CREAM, a clustering-based method that addresses the mixup of activations between less discriminative foreground regions and the background. CAM-guided momentum preservation is used to learn class-specific context embeddings, which are then used for re-activation mapping. The paper also formulates re-activation mapping as a parameter estimation problem and solves it using an EM-based soft-clustering algorithm. CREAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in WSOL and has the potential to be applied in various other WSOL approaches.
