Image features are crucial in computer vision pipelines, and deep learning methods have revolutionized the computation of these features. Traditionally, image features are computed using neural networks, where a network is trained to classify images and the penultimate layer outputs are considered as image features. However, this approach requires large amounts of annotated data. To overcome this limitation, unsupervised learning methods have emerged, which learn image features without the need for class labels. These methods can be generative or discriminative, and in this paper, we focus on discriminative methods that are more suitable for downstream tasks like image classification and object detection.Comparing different image representation learning algorithms is important, but prior works tend to group unsupervised methods together and compare them against a single representative of supervised learning methods. This approach fails to capture the significant variations among unsupervised methods. In this paper, we compare six state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on ImageNet and fine-grained visual categorization datasets using multiple benchmarks. We extend existing methods and introduce novel ones to demonstrate the wide variation in how unsupervised methods learn to represent images.We evaluate the learned embeddings using multiple metrics, including performance-based benchmarks, Linear Centered Kernel Alignment analysis, and two new metrics for comparing embeddings: nearest neighbor graph similarity and linear overlap. Additionally, we propose a framework for measuring augmentation invariance in representations learned by different unsupervised methods. Our results show that there is no clear "best" method and highlight the similarity and divergence among unsupervised models in different layers.In conclusion, this paper provides insights into the performance and properties of unsupervised methods for representation learning. It emphasizes the need for further research to improve unsupervised methods and addresses the challenges associated with unsupervised learning, such as color invariance.
