Aerial object detection is an important task in computer vision, particularly in remote image understanding. Unlike generic object detection, aerial target localization poses its own challenges, including non-axis aligned objects with arbitrary orientations and densely packed distribution with complex context. Most mainstream approaches approach aerial object detection as a rotated object localization problem, with direct angle-based orientation regression methods dominating the research area. However, these methods still face issues such as loss discontinuity and regression inconsistency due to the bounded periodic nature of angular orientation and the definition of rotated bounding boxes.To address these challenges, this paper proposes an oriented object detector for aerial images called Oriented RepPoints. It introduces an adaptive points representation for diverse orientations, shapes, and poses. Unlike conventional orientation regression approaches, the proposed method achieves precise aerial detection with accurate orientation and captures the underlying geometric structure of arbitrary-oriented aerial instances.The paper presents an initial adaptive points generation scheme based on the center point, which is further refined to adapt to the aerial object. Three oriented conversion functions are introduced to obtain the oriented bounding box based on the layouts of the learned points. Additionally, an adaptive points assessment and assignment (APAA) scheme is proposed for point set learning, considering not only classification and localization but also orientation and point-wise feature correlation. This scheme allows the detector to capture non-axis aligned features and assign representative oriented reppoints samples. A spatial constraint is also proposed to help vulnerable points find their instance owner in complex aerial scenes.The proposed Oriented RepPoints framework achieves more precise detection performance with accurate orientation compared to orientation regression-based methods. The main contributions of this paper include the effective aerial object detector that introduces flexible adaptive points as the representation, a novel quality assessment and sample assignment scheme for adaptive points learning, and extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrating promising qualitative and quantitative results.
