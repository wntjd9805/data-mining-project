The paper introduces a novel active learning (AL) method called Active Learning by FeAture Mixing (ALFA-Mix) for machine learning applications. ALFA-Mix aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the active learning process by selecting the most valuable instances to be labeled in the training process. Unlike existing AL methods that rely solely on the predicted output, ALFA-Mix leverages the feature representations of both labeled and unlabeled instances to uncover hidden traits and identify novel features for the model. This approach involves interpolating the features of an unlabeled instance with those of labeled instances to explore the neighborhood surrounding the unlabeled instance. The paper provides theoretical support for the method and shows that the interpolation can be achieved by considering the difference between the features of the unlabeled and labeled instances, as well as the gradient of the model with respect to the features at the unlabeled point. By choosing a subset of labeled instances as anchors and selecting unlabeled instances that lead to a change in the model's prediction when mixed with the anchors, ALFA-Mix effectively identifies informative instances for labeling. To ensure diversity in the selected instances, a simple clustering is performed in the candidate set, and the centroids are chosen as the points to be queried for labeling. The paper demonstrates the superiority of ALFA-Mix over existing AL methods in various settings and datasets, including image, OpenML, and video datasets, achieving higher accuracy and significant gains in low-data regimes. Additionally, the paper explores the application of ALFA-Mix in vision transformers and shows its effectiveness in achieving superior performance compared to random selection and state-of-the-art methods. Overall, ALFA-Mix offers an efficient and scalable approach to active learning, leveraging feature mixing to enhance the quality of annotated datasets for machine learning applications.
