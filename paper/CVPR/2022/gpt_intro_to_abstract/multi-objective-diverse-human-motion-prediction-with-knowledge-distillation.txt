Human motion prediction is crucial in various applications, including human-robot interaction, autonomous driving, and animation. Accurate motion prediction enables autonomous vehicles to plan safe strategies and promotes the cooperation between robots and humans. However, due to the intrinsic properties of diversity and uncertainty in human future motion, predicting diverse human motions becomes a challenging problem in computer science. In this paper, we discuss two lines of research in this area: accurate motion prediction without considering diversity and methods that increase the diversity of motion prediction using deep generative models or diverse sampling techniques. While deep generative models capture stochastic behaviors, they may suffer from mode collapse problems. Additionally, sampling the minor modes of data distribution poses challenges. To tackle these issues, previous works propose new losses and generative models but require preset hyperparameters, limiting their applicability during testing. In real-world applications such as pedestrian motion prediction in autonomous driving, it is essential to balance accuracy and diversity sampling. Therefore, we present a multi-objective variational inference framework with two different priors to adjust the ratio of accuracy and diversity sampling during testing. We also introduce a method to obtain multi-modal pseudo-ground-truth future motions recursively. However, the exponential increase in sampling number makes direct implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we propose an oracle system that provides possible future motions with short-term horizons to guide the predictor iteratively. Our contributions include the proposal of a unified multi-objective conditional variational autoencoder-based human motion prediction framework, the learning of a short-term oracle system to increase motion diversity, and state-of-the-art performance achieved in two human motion datasets through experiments.
