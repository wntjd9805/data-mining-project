Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a valuable technique in computer vision that aims to represent objects and their relationships in an image using a graphical representation. SGG has been applied to various vision tasks, such as 3D scene understanding, visual question answering, and image captioning. Existing SGG models typically employ graph neural network-based message passing (GMP) mechanisms for context modeling to learn discriminative representations for node and edge prediction. However, current GMPs suffer from spurious correlations between nodes, which result in ambiguous representations. Additionally, these models lack diversity in relationship prediction due to a long-tailed distribution of relationships and missing relationship annotations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Regularized Unrolling Network (RU-Net) for SGG. The RU-Net includes an Unrolled Message Passing (U-MP) module with an (cid:2)p-based graph regularization term to suppress spurious connections between nodes, improving the robustness of GMP. It also introduces a Group Diversity Enhancement (GDE) module to promote diversity in relationship predictions. Experimental evaluation on three popular SGG databases demonstrates that RU-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.
