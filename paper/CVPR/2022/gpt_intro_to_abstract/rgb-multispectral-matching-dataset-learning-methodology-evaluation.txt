Traditional RGB sensors mimic the color perception of trichromatic mammals by using three channels to acquire images. However, multi-spectral (MS) imaging devices offer the ability to capture images with a larger number of channels, enabling the extraction of additional information from the scene. These MS sensors have applications in various fields such as artwork analysis, agriculture, target tracking, and medical diagnostics. Although MS sensors are commonly used in industrial settings or expensive equipment, the potential to run these applications on consumer devices like mobile phones presents interesting prospects. Unfortunately, MS sensors have not yet been ported to consumer devices due to limitations in resolution, size, and cost. This paper addresses the challenge of developing MS cameras compatible with the cost and size requirements of mobile devices. The authors propose the first large-scale, publicly available dataset for studying RGB-MS registration and introduce a deep learning architecture that can tackle the cross-spectral and resolution-unbalanced matching problem. The dataset contains stereo pairs of low-resolution MS images and high-resolution RGB images, along with densely annotated stereo pairs for accurate registration. The proposed deep learning architecture serves as a baseline for the dataset and enables the computation of registered MS images at arbitrary resolutions. The contributions of this work include the investigation of the challenging problem of cross-spectral and resolution-unbalanced dense matching, the creation of a large-scale dataset, the introduction of a training methodology leveraging unlabelled images, and the proposal of a deep architecture for computing correspondences between images with different resolutions and spectral content. The availability of this dataset and the proposed methods can unlock MS applications on consumer devices and facilitate the development of new applications specific to mobile setups.
