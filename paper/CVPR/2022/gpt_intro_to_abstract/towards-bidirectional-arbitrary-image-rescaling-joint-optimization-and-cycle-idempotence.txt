In this paper, we address the challenge of rescaling images with arbitrary scale factors in real-world applications. While recent deep learning-based image super-resolution methods have achieved significant advancements in upscaling images, they are typically optimized for fixed scale factors and known downscaling degradation kernels. However, there is a growing interest in models that can handle arbitrary scale factors, including arbitrary upscaling for scale factors within a certain range or asymmetric arbitrary upscaling. These models are optimized for unidirectional upscaling processes. In contrast, we propose a joint optimization process that can simultaneously learn arbitrary downscaling and upscaling. By modeling both processes as equivalent subpixel splitting and merging operations and learning through a downscaling-to-upscaling cycle, our method achieves superior arbitrary upscaling accuracy while maintaining high quality in downscaled outputs. We introduce a subpixel weight function for subpixel splitting and merging and use ground-truth and weak supervision to optimize the model for both upscaling and downscaling. Additionally, we explore the effects of multiple downscaling-to-upscaling cycles and introduce a cycle idempotence test to assess the output quality. Our method outperforms existing models in arbitrary image rescaling and demonstrates robustness in repetitive downscaling-to-upscaling cycles. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance in tests of arbitrary asymmetric scales and large out-of-distribution scales. Overall, our contributions include proposing a joint process for bidirectional arbitrary image rescaling, introducing a cycle idempotence test, and achieving superior performance in arbitrary image rescaling tasks.
