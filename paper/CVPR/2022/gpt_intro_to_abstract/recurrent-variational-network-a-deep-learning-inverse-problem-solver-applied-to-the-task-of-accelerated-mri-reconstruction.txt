Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical imaging modality, known for its ability to produce highly detailed anatomical images. Due to its non-invasive nature and absence of ionizing radiation, MRI has become a preferred imaging technique. However, the sequential acquisition of data in the time-consuming frequency domain (k-space) leads to lengthy scanning times and patient discomfort, limiting its application in dynamic treatments such as image-guided radiotherapy. To address this issue, researchers have explored accelerating MRI using techniques like Parallel Imaging (PI) and Compressed Sensing (CS), and the combination of both (PI-CS). PI utilizes multiple radio-frequency receiver coils to simultaneously acquire data and reduce acquisition time, while CS involves sub-sampling k-space to achieve acceleration but at the cost of image quality degradation. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise in solving inverse problems in imaging, including accelerated MRI reconstruction. DL-based methods, when combined with PI-CS, outperform traditional approaches by producing reconstructed images with fewer artifacts. The availability of publicly accessible raw MRI data provided by challenges like fastMRI and Calgary-Campinas has further enabled the development of DL-based state-of-the-art baselines for faithful image reconstruction from sub-sampled k-space measurements. Motivated by the need for further acceleration, this paper proposes a novel DL architecture, the Recurrent Variational Network, inspired by Variational Network and Recurrent Inference Machine approaches. The proposed method is applied to the task of reconstructing images from accelerated MRI data using a recurrent-based DL solver. The paper highlights the contributions of this work, including the introduction of the Recurrent Variational Network, the first presentation of a recurrent-based DL solver for imaging inverse problems in the k-space domain, and the achievement of state-of-the-art results on the Calgary-Campinas public brain dataset, surpassing current baselines through quantitative and qualitative experiments.
