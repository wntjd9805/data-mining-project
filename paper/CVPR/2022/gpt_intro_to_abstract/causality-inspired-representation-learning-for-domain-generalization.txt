Abstract: Deep neural networks face significant challenges when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) problems caused by the increasing complexity of real-world tasks. Applying a model trained on a different domain typically results in a catastrophic drop in performance. To address this domain shift problem, Domain Generalization (DG) methods have gained attention, aiming to generalize knowledge from multiple source domains to an unseen target domain. While existing DG methods focus on statistical dependence between data and labels, they often fail to explain the underlying causal mechanisms. This paper proposes a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to formalize the DG problem and uncover the intrinsic causal mechanisms between data and labels for better generalization ability. The paper introduces a Causality-Informed Representation Learning (CIRL) algorithm, which uses an adversarial mask module to detect and enhance dimensions containing causal information. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. This work highlights the insufficiency of modeling statistical dependence alone and emphasizes the importance of understanding the causal relationships in DG tasks.
