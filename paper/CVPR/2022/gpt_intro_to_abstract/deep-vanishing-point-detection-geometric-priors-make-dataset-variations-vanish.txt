Vanishing point detection in images has significant real-world applications in camera calibration, scene understanding, visual SLAM, and autonomous driving. Deep learning has emerged as an effective approach for vanishing point detection, but it faces challenges such as expensive and error-prone manual annotation, computational resource requirements, domain shifts, and architectural limitations. This paper aims to address these challenges by incorporating geometric priors into deep vanishing point detection. Two geometric priors, the Hough Transform and Gaussian sphere mapping, are added to the model. The Hough Transform maps lines to individual bins, and the Gaussian sphere mapping converts bins to great circles, with vanishing points detected at the intersection of these circles. This knowledge-based approach makes the model data-efficient, less dependent on specific domains, and easily adaptable to variations of the problem. The benefits include reduced annotation and computational resource needs, improved generalization to different data distributions, and interpretability for easy adaptation to different problem formulations. The Hough Transform and Gaussian sphere mapping modules are end-to-end trainable and leverage learned representations while incorporating prior knowledge. The contributions of this paper include the addition of two geometric priors, validation of their accuracy on large datasets, improved data efficiency on smaller datasets, handling different problem variants, and reducing sensitivity to domain shifts.
