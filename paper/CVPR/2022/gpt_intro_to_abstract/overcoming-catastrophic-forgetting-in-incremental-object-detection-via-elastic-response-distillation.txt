In this paper, we address the problem of incremental object detection (IOD) and propose an Elastic Response Distillation (ERD) scheme to learn responses from classification and regression heads. We introduce incremental localization distillation in regression response to handle location ambiguity during incremental learning. Additionally, we propose the Elastic Response Selection (ERS) strategy to automatically select distillation nodes based on statistical characteristics to evaluate the qualities of different responses. Our method significantly alleviates catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments on the MS COCO dataset. The contributions of this work include exploring the response-based distillation method for IOD, analyzing the differences with feature-based solutions, and proposing ERD and ERS strategies.
