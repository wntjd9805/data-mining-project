This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised part segmentation in computer vision. Part representations are important for various high-level tasks, but supervised training for keypoints and part segmentation maps is laborious and not easily applicable across different object categories and tasks. While unsupervised keypoint detection methods exist, unsupervised segmentation methods are still underdeveloped. The authors propose a novel approach that involves training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate images conditioned on latent masks, reducing the reliance on image pairs and pre-defined transformations. The generated images are then used to train a segmentation network. The authors introduce a hierarchical image generation process that incorporates masks, allowing for meaningful grouping of pixels into regions with shared appearance. The success of the GAN framework relies on design choices that preserve translational equivariance of parts. The contributions of this work are an unsupervised GAN approach for training part segmentation, a novel hierarchical image generator, and the alleviation of prior assumptions on saliency maps and object position. The authors also discuss the ethics and risks associated with GANs and highlight the benefits of their unsupervised approach.
