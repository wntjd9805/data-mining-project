Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has gained significant attention in the computer vision community as it plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks such as human action recognition, scene graph generation, and image captioning. Recent advances have shown that HOI detection can be formulated as a set prediction problem. Existing HOI transformers can be categorized into single-branch and parallel-branch transformers. While the single-branch transformer adopts a multi-task strategy with a single decoder, the parallel-branch transformer utilizes separate decoders for instance detection and interaction classification. However, the parallel-branch transformer suffers from shortcomings in complex scenarios, including potential errors due to mis-grouping and the lack of consideration for joint configurations of instances and interactions.To address these limitations, we propose a Disentangled Transformer (DisTR) for HOI detection. DisTR decouples the task of triplet prediction into human-object pair detection and interaction classification through distinct instance and interaction streams. Both the encoder and decoder in DisTR are disentangled, allowing for the extraction of different contextual information for each sub-task. Unlike existing parallel-decoder transformers, our instance decoder predicts a set of interactive human-object pairs instead of individual objects. To associate the predictions of the task decoders, we utilize a base decoder to generate a unified representation for HOI triplets, followed by a coarse-to-fine strategy to refine the task-specific representations. Additionally, we introduce an attentional fusion block to facilitate communication between the task decoders.We evaluate our method on two public benchmarks, V-COCO and HICO-DET, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The visualizations of the cross attentions in our task decoders demonstrate the effectiveness of our disentangled strategy. The contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) We propose a disentangled strategy for HOI detection, decoupling the triplet prediction into human-object pair detection and interaction classification. (2) We develop a new transformer architecture with disentangled encoder and decoder, along with a coarse-to-fine strategy and attentional fusion block for improved performance. (3) Our method sets new state-of-the-art results on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks.
