Supervised learning has shown significant progress in object detection due to the availability of large labeled datasets. However, collecting accurate annotations is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has emerged as an alternative approach that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to optimize object detectors. Self-training, particularly the mean teacher framework, has proven to be effective in SSOD. Existing pseudo labeling methods in mean teacher frameworks use a fixed confidence threshold to filter out low-quality pseudo labels, which may lead to label mismatch problems and confirmation bias during self-training.In this paper, we address the label mismatch problem in SSOD from two perspectives: distribution-level and instance-level. At the distribution-level, generating unbiased pseudo labels that match the ground truth labels consistently is challenging due to class-imbalanced data distribution. We propose a label distribution-aware confidence threshold (ACT) that adapts to the label distribution in the labeled data. This approach ensures generation of unbiased pseudo labels for the unlabeled data. At the instance-level, we propose a proposal self-assignment method to handle label assignment ambiguity caused by the poor quality of pseudo labels. We use reliable pseudo labels for hard learning and uncertain pseudo labels for soft learning, leveraging the student network and the mean teacher netowrk in a mutually beneficial manner. Additionally, we introduce reliable pseudo label mining (RPLM) to convert high-quality uncertain pseudo labels into reliable ones.We evaluate our proposed LabelMatch framework on popular SSOD datasets, including MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art results across all benchmarks, especially in settings with scarce labeled data. The contributions of this paper include a thorough analysis of label mismatch problems in SSOD, the proposal of the LabelMatch framework to address these problems, and the achievement of new state-of-the-art performance in SSOD benchmarks. We also provide a MMDetection-based semi-supervised object detection codebase for the fair evaluation of SSOD algorithms.
