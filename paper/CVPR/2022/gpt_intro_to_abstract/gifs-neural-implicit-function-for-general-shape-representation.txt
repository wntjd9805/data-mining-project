3D shape reconstruction is a crucial problem in computer vision, robotics, and graphics. The choice of shape representation significantly affects the quality of reconstruction. Neural Implicit Functions (NIFs) have recently emerged as a promising approach for high quality and high resolution reconstruction with a compact representation. However, most NIF approaches are limited to binary classification of the 3D space, which is insufficient for representing multi-layer or non-watertight shapes. In this paper, we propose a General Implicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS) that focuses on the relationships between every two 3D points. Instead of predefined categories, GIFS defines a binary flag to indicate whether two points are on the same side of object surfaces. We employ neural networks to approximate these binary flags based on 3D point embeddings. This representation allows us to capture the relationships between different points and represent general shapes including multi-layer and non-watertight shapes. To recover the shape from GIFS, we modify the Marching Cubes algorithm to build triangle faces from sampled binary flags. Experimental results on ShapeNet demonstrate that GIFS achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D reconstruction and can be trained directly on raw data, avoiding tedious data processing and ensuring accuracy. Our method also shows advantages in rendering efficiency and visual fidelity over existing approaches.
