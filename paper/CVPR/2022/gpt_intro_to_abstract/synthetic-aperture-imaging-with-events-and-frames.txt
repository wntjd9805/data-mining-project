Abstract: This paper introduces a novel fusion-based Synthetic Aperture Imaging (SAI) method, called EF-SAI, which aims to achieve high-quality imaging performance invariant to occlusion densities. Unlike existing SAI approaches, EF-SAI combines the advantages of Event-based Synthetic Aperture Imaging (E-SAI) and Frame-based SAI (F-SAI) to overcome the limitations of both methods. To achieve this, a deep neural network, EF-SAI-Net, is proposed to reconstruct occluded images by encoding and fusing multi-modal signals from events and frames. The network includes a cross-modal enhancement module to suppress noise and disturbances, and a density-aware fusion module for adaptive feature selection based on occlusion densities. Extensive evaluations on a new EF-SAI dataset demonstrate that EF-SAI outperforms existing SAI approaches and maintains consistent performance across varying occlusion densities. This research has applications in occlusion removal and can contribute to advancements in the field of computer vision.
