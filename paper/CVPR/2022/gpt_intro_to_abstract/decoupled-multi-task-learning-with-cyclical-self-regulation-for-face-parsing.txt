This paper presents an end-to-end face parsing method for fine-grained semantic segmentation of facial components. The existing methods based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are limited in capturing global contextual information, which is crucial for accurate face parsing. To address this limitation, the paper proposes a Decoupled Multi-task Learning with Cyclical Self-Regulation (DML-CSR) approach. The multi-task model consists of three tasks: face parsing, binary edge detection, and category edge detection. The proposed approach utilizes a Dynamic Dual Graph Convolutional Network (DDGCN) to capture long-range contextual information and solve the spatial inconsistency caused by pooling operations. It also introduces a category-aware edge detection module to handle boundary confusion in both single-face and multi-face scenarios. To address the problem of noisy labels in training datasets, a cyclically learning scheduler inspired by self-training is introduced, which improves model reliability and generalization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of overall F1 score, while reducing computation resources and inference time compared to existing methods.
