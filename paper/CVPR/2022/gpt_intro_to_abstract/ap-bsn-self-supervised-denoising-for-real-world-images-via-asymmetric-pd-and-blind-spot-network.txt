Image denoising is a crucial task in computer vision, aimed at removing noise from a noisy signal to recover a clean image. Learning-based denoising algorithms have gained popularity with the advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, these methods often rely on synthetic noise models that do not generalize well to real-world noise characteristics, leading to limited practical application. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised denoising approach called Asymmetric PD-Based Blind-Spot Network (AP-BSN) to address this limitation. AP-BSN leverages a pixel-shuffle downsampling technique to break spatial correlation in real-world noise and combines it with Blind-Spot Network (BSN) for pixel-wise independent denoising. We also introduce a novel post-processing method called random-replacing refinement (R3) to further enhance the performance of AP-BSN. Our experiments demonstrate that AP-BSN outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods and even unsupervised/unpaired approaches by a significant margin on various datasets. The proposed AP-BSN framework offers an effective and efficient solution for denoising real-world sRGB noisy images in a self-supervised manner.
