This paper addresses the issue of contextual bias in multi-target visual tasks, such as multi-label classification. While modeling context has shown potential to enhance performance in these tasks, there is a tendency for the classifiers to be misled by context, either assigning high scores to non-existent objects in common scenes or ignoring objects in rare backgrounds. Existing models that attempt to mitigate this bias overlook the fundamental theory behind contextual bias and fail to address the problem comprehensively. This paper presents a Structural Causal Model that uncovers the causal relevance between contextual priori, object feature, contextual bias, and final prediction. The authors propose a novel debiasing paradigm called the Causal Context Debiasing (CCD) Module, which uses causal inference to eliminate the effect of contextual bias and obtain the direct causal effect from the objects themselves. The proposed method is model-agnostic and achieves performance improvements without introducing complicated architectures or additional external information. Experimental results on datasets such as MS-COCO, PASCAL-VOC, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Overall, this paper contributes to a better understanding of contextual bias and provides a practical solution to mitigate its impact in multi-target visual tasks.
