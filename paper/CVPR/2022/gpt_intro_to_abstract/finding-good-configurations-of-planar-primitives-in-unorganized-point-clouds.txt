Geometric primitives are widely used to process large 3D data sets, providing a concise representation compared to raw point clouds or dense meshes. Among these primitives, planes are especially relevant in man-made environments, such as urban and indoor scenes. They have been utilized in various data processing tasks, including data registration, object recognition, simultaneous localization and mapping, structure from motion, urban modeling, and surface reconstruction.Fitting planar primitives to 3D point clouds is a longstanding challenge in computer vision. This problem is commonly approached as a clustering operation, with input points grouped into planar components based on a specified fitting tolerance. However, solving this problem is not straightforward due to the unknown number of primitives and the presence of outliers, which are points that do not fall within the fitting tolerance zones of any primitive. Finding an optimal configuration of planar primitives requires balancing three objectives: fidelity (minimizing the distance between a primitive and its associated inliers), simplicity (minimizing the number of primitives), and completeness (maximizing the ratio of inliers).Existing methods do not explicitly address these three objectives simultaneously. They typically optimize one or two objectives using incremental mechanisms, multi-labeling energy minimization models, or neural networks. These approaches are limited in their ability to explore the large solution space of the problem.In this paper, we propose an algorithm for fitting planar primitives to unorganized point clouds that achieves high fidelity, simplicity, and completeness. Our algorithm incorporates an exploration mechanism that refines an initial configuration by minimizing a multi-objective energy function. The exploration process involves five geometric operators that create, remove, and modify primitives, as well as reassign inliers and outliers. The algorithm combines global variational optimization with a priority queue for local operations that are likely to decrease the energy. Additionally, our method guarantees that the fidelity, simplicity, and completeness of the initial configuration will not be degraded.We showcase the effectiveness of our method on various types of scenes, ranging from organic to man-made, and using different sensors like laser scanning and multiview stereo. We also demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods and its advantages for reconstructing compact meshes in conjunction with a plane assembly method.
