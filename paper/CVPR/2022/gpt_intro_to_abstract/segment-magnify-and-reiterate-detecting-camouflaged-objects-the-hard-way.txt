Camouflaged object detection (COD) is a task that involves identifying hidden objects in the background. It has applications in various fields such as agriculture, art, and medical diagnosis. The difficulty lies in accurately distinguishing the subtle differences between the camouflaged object and the background. Recent works utilizing deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performance but struggle with accurately detecting small camouflaged objects. This is due to the use of single-stage detection methods, where many objects are not initially detectable. Inspired by human behavior, we propose SegMaR, an iterative refinement framework that combines segmenting, magnifying, and reiterating to gradually discover more accurate camouflaged objects. Our approach builds a camouflaged segmentation network, performs object magnification using an attention-based sampler, and then refines the detection in iterative stages. SegMaR is a unified and general framework applicable to various camouflaged segmentation networks. We introduce a distraction module and a new non-binary ground truth called discriminative mask to enhance object localization and edge extraction. Our contributions include the SegMaR framework, an effective camouflaged segmentation network, and improved performance on COD benchmarks, especially for small camouflaged objects.
