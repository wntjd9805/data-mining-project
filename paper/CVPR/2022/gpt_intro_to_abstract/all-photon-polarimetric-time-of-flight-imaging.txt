Depth cameras have become essential tools in the field of 3D vision, providing scene geometry for various applications such as autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and robotics. While there have been different approaches to extracting depth information, pulsed Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras have gained popularity due to their high precision and robustness. These cameras measure the round-trip return time of light and capture a temporal histogram of photon arrival events. The captured photons can be categorized into two components - surface reflections and sub-surface scattering. Traditionally, most ToF methods only consider surface reflections and discard the sub-surface information. However, in this work, we propose an all-photon polarimetric ToF imaging method that leverages both surface and sub-surface photons to estimate scene parameters such as depth, normals, and material properties. This method combines ToF imaging with polarization analysis, utilizing a novel temporal-polarimetric bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. We also propose a light-efficient temporal-polarimetric acquisition approach to capture the necessary data. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in simulating and capturing scene information. However, there are some limitations to our current setup, including the long acquisition time and limited photon numbers. Future improvements could focus on accelerating the acquisition process and using higher-power laser sources to enhance measurement quality.
