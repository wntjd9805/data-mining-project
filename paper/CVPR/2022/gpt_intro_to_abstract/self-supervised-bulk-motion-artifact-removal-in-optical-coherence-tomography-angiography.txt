Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive imaging technique used for diagnosing various retinal conditions and studying tumor vasculature. However, OCTA images are often affected by bulk motion artifacts (BMA), which degrade image quality and hinder quantitative analysis. Although previous approaches have been developed to remove BMA, they either require duplicate scans or extensive training data with annotations. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised BMA removal method that leverages the structural and appearance information carried in the BMA stripe region. By utilizing gradient-based structural information and injecting it into the model, our approach can capture more connectivity and fill large gaps. We also introduce horizontal gradients to make the model aware of potential structures under BMA. The proposed method is trained in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need for manual annotations. Experimental results on a mouse cortex OCTA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in removing BMA and improving image quality. Our contributions include proposing a new structural denoising model, developing a self-supervised training approach, and achieving simultaneous BMA and background noise removal for image enhancement.
