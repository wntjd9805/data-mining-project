Artistic portraits play a significant role in various industries such as comics, animations, posters, and advertising. This paper focuses on exemplar-based portrait style transfer, which aims to transfer the style of an artistic portrait onto a target face. This technique allows novices to easily transform their photographs into stunning artworks resembling their favorite pieces without requiring professional skills. Previous research in automatic portrait style transfer has explored image style transfer and image-to-image translation methods. However, the state-of-the-art technique, StyleGAN, has shown great potential for high-resolution artistic portrait generation through transfer learning. Although StyleGAN allows for exemplar-based single-domain style mixing, it lacks the ability to perform style transfer between source and target domains effectively. This is because misalignment between the domains can result in unwanted artifacts. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Dual-StyleGAN, a novel model that can effectively model and control dual styles for exemplar-based portrait style transfer. Dual-StyleGAN retains the intrinsic style path of StyleGAN for the original domain while adding an extrinsic style path to model and control the target extended domain. The model design includes a residual manner for introducing the extrinsic style to the convolution layers, while the model training incorporates a progressive fine-tuning method. Additionally, the paper presents a facial destylization method to provide supervision for learning diverse styles and avoiding mode collapse. The proposed Dual-StyleGAN offers high-quality and high-resolution pastiches, providing flexible and diverse control over color and structural styles. This approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in terms of high-quality and diverse artistic portrait generation. The design of the extrinsic style path introduces style features from external domains and provides hierarchical style manipulation. The progressive fine-tuning scheme enables robust transfer learning over networks with architecture modifications.
