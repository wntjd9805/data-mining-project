Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been widely used in the computer vision field, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. In the medical image analysis field, CNN-based architectures have been applied to various modalities such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and Ultrasound. However, there are trade-offs between 2D and 3D representation learning on 3D medical images, as 2D methods have advantages from pre-trained models but lack the ability to analyze 3D image contexts, while 3D methods require large parameters and computation costs. Transformer networks, on the other hand, have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision processing, offering a wider receptive field compared to CNN networks. Recently, a pure-transformer-based architecture called Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown comparable performance to CNN-based methods on image classification. However, pure-transformer-based architectures struggle to learn meaningful representations on small datasets, which is a challenge in the analysis of 3D medical images due to limited accessibility, high computational costs, expensive annotation, and class-imbalance problems. This paper proposes a three-dimensional Medical image classifier using Multi-plane and Multi-slice Transformer (M3T) network to analyze Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in 3D MRI images. The M3T model combines CNN and transformer architectures, leveraging the strengths of both methods for 3D image classification. The proposed hybrid network achieves higher performance compared to pure CNN and transformer methods. Additionally, the activated areas in the 3D MRI images are visualized using interpretability methods, providing explanation and interpretation of AD-related abnormalities. The proposed method shows promising results and could contribute to the analysis of 3D medical images.
