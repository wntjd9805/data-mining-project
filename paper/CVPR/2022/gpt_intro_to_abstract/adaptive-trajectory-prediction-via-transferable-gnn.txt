Trajectory prediction is crucial in various real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, navigation, and video surveillance. Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is particularly important in the self-driving scenario for tasks like planning, decision making, environmental perception, person identification, and anomaly detection. However, trajectory prediction is a challenging task due to the complex and subtle interactions between pedestrians and their surroundings.Existing methods for trajectory prediction often focus on learning generic motion patterns but overlook the distribution differences between training and testing samples. This learning strategy introduces domain bias and disparities into the models. To quantitatively evaluate the potential domain gaps, numerical statistics from five commonly used trajectory domains are analyzed, showing significant differences among the domains.To demonstrate the performance drop when dealing with different trajectory domains, three state-of-the-art methods are applied and evaluated on consistent settings. The results highlight the domain bias problem and emphasize the need for domain adaptation techniques.Domain adaptation aims to address domain shift issues by minimizing the distribution distance between source and target domains. However, the unique nature of trajectory prediction, where a "sample" consists of multiple trajectories with different pedestrians, poses challenges for traditional domain adaptation approaches. Therefore, this work proposes a transferable graph neural network with adaptive knowledge learning to tackle the trajectory domain shift problem.The proposed method incorporates a novel attention-based adaptive knowledge learning module and a trajectory graph neural network. These components effectively extract comprehensive spatial-temporal features and facilitate domain-invariant knowledge learning.The contributions of this work include the development of a unified T-GNN method for joint trajectory prediction and adaptive domain-invariant knowledge learning. Additionally, a specifically designed graph neural network is introduced to extract spatial-temporal feature representations. An innovative attention-based adaptive knowledge learning module is also presented for individual-level transferable feature representations. This work also establishes a new setting for pedestrian trajectory prediction, enabling strong baselines under the domain-shift scenario.Experimental results on five trajectory domains demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.Overall, this work addresses the domain shift problem in trajectory prediction and proposes a novel transferable graph neural network with adaptive knowledge learning. The proposed method achieves promising results and contributes to advancing the field of trajectory prediction in various real-world applications.
