This paper introduces a novel feature alignment method called Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM) for fine-grained few-shot classification. The paper addresses the issue of insufficient labeled images and the high cost of labeling by focusing on few-shot classification, which trains a model with high adaptability to novel classes. The episodic learning strategy is used, where each episode consists of sampled categories from the dataset, with support sets for training and query sets for evaluation. The paper discusses metric-based learning as a promising direction for few-shot classification, where a deep representation is learned using a predefined or online-trained metric. However, the features of a novel class extracted by a model trained on base classes may not form a tight cluster, leading to semantic variations in the distribution of base classes. To alleviate this, the paper explores task-dynamic feature alignment methods, specifically spatial alignment and channel alignment, to better represent semantic features for novel classes. Existing alignment methods have shown effectiveness for general few-shot classification tasks, but have achieved insignificant gains for fine-grained datasets. Therefore, the paper introduces TDM, a module that localizes discriminative regions by weighting channels per class. This module highlights channels that represent discriminative regions and restrains the contributions of other channels based on class-wise channel weights. TDM consists of two components: Support Attention Module (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM), which generate support weights and query weights, respectively. These weights are used to produce task-adaptive feature maps. The proposed TDM method is highly applicable to prior metric-based few-shot classification models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in fine-grained few-shot classification tasks when combined with recent few-shot classification models.
