This paper explores the field of biomimicry in computer vision, specifically in the context of stereo depth estimation. Mimicking natural strategies, such as the human visual ability to perceive depth, can provide insights for solving complex design challenges. Stereo depth estimation has long been a challenging task in computer vision due to the ill-posed nature of the problem, limitations of RGB sensors, and algorithmic challenges.To address these challenges, the authors propose a novel approach called Concentrate Net, which leverages event cameras or neuromorphic cameras. Event cameras capture pixel-wise intensity differences and report them as a stream of events, similar to how the human eye perceives the world. However, this unconventional data stream requires new algorithms to utilize its unique specifications effectively.The authors present a method for estimating stereo depth from a pair of event cameras by concentrating the event representation tensors to preserve details and predict dense depth with sharp edges. They also transfer knowledge from future events during training to improve the system's understanding of the scene. The use of future events allows the network to distill information and generate better predictions by leveraging the previously observed future events.The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by evaluating it on the challenging outdoor stereo events from the DSEC benchmark dataset. The results show that their method outperforms previous state-of-the-art event stereo depth estimation methods qualitatively and quantitatively.The paper also provides an overview of event cameras and their unique characteristics, such as reporting events asynchronously and having higher dynamic ranges. These characteristics make event cameras less susceptible to motion blur and capable of capturing scene details that conventional cameras may miss.In conclusion, this paper introduces a biomimicry-inspired approach for stereo depth estimation using event cameras. The proposed Concentrate Net method shows promising results in handling the challenges posed by sparse event streams and improves the accuracy of stereo depth estimation.
