In recent years, deep learning has made significant progress in image super-resolution (SR) using regression-based methods. However, these methods often produce blurry and unrealistic SR images. To overcome this limitation, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Flow-based models have been introduced, which generate high-fidelity details. However, these models have their own challenges and limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Local Autoregressive Super-Resolution (LAR-SR) that combines the advantages of regression and autoregressive models. We leverage a regression model to generate a coarse SR result that captures the main content and semantic structure of the image. Then, we use a local autoregressive module, based on a learned texture codebook from Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQVAE), to efficiently generate texture details. Our main contributions include:1. Introducing the LAR-SR framework, the first autoregressive-based framework designed specifically for super-resolution.2. Proposing a novel local autoregressive module that generates texture details in a patch-wise and parallel mode, leveraging a texture codebook learned from VQVAE and coarse-SR output from the regression model.3. Conducting extensive experiments on general super resolution and face super resolution tasks, showing that our LAR-SR approach achieves state-of-the-art results compared to baseline approaches on popular datasets.Overall, the LAR-SR framework effectively combines regression and autoregressive models to generate high-fidelity and computationally efficient SR images.
