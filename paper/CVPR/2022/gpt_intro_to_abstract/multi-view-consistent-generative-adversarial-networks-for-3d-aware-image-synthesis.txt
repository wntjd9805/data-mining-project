Abstract:This paper addresses the problem of 3D-aware image synthesis with explicit control over camera pose. While generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown impressive results in generating high-quality images, most methods focus on learning the manifold of 2D images and ignore the 3D representation of the scene. Previous approaches for 3D-aware image synthesis have made use of techniques such as voxels and neural radiance fields (NeRF), but they often fail to generate multi-view consistent images due to a lack of geometry constraints. In this paper, we propose MVCGAN, a multi-view consistent generative model that leverages the underlying 3D geometry information. By jointly optimizing multiple views and enforcing stereo correspondence through projective geometry, MVCGAN generates high-quality images with multi-view consistency. Additionally, we address the challenge of rendering high-resolution images with fine details by adopting a hybrid MLP-CNN architecture. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MVCGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D-aware image synthesis.
