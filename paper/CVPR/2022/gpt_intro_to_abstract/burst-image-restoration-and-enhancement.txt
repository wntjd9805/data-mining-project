High-end DSLR cameras capture high-quality images, but computational photography aims to achieve similar results with smartphone cameras. However, smartphones have physical constraints that affect image quality, such as small sensors leading to limited spatial resolution and small lenses causing noise and color distortions in low-light conditions. To overcome these limitations, burst photography, which involves capturing multiple frames quickly, is a potential solution. However, capturing burst images introduces alignment challenges and can result in artifacts like ghosting and blurring. Existing burst processing techniques extract and align features separately, hindering information exchange among frames. This paper presents BIPNet, a burst image processing approach that utilizes a pseudo-burst feature fusion mechanism for inter-frame communication and consolidation. BIPNet includes an alignment technique that uses deformable convolutions for adaptive frame alignment and edge boosting refinement to preserve high-frequency information. The network also incorporates residual global context attention for early denoising. BIPNet is demonstrated to be effective in burst super-resolution, burst low-light image enhancement, and burst denoising tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and provides ablation studies and visual examples to showcase its performance. Overall, BIPNet offers a robust and flexible approach for burst image processing tasks.
