Object detection has achieved significant advancements in recent years with the advent of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, traditional detection models that regress the horizontal bounding box of objects may not accurately locate objects with arbitrary orientations, such as cars in drone cameras and texts in streetscape. Rotated object detection poses unique challenges due to the wide range of applications and the need for precise localization.This paper proposes an orientation-sensitive heatmap based rotated detector called OSKDet. The authors encode a set of keypoints to represent the rotated target and design an orientation-sensitive heatmap that matches the target shape more accurately. This heatmap allows the model to implicitly learn the orientation and shape of the rotated target, enhancing the model's spatial representation and transformation capabilities.In addition, the authors explore an unordered keypoint fusion representation to address the confusion caused by keypoint order. This representation eliminates the learning confusion associated with rule-based keypoint ordering. Furthermore, a location quality uncertainty module is proposed to improve classification accuracy by incorporating the generated heatmaps.Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmarks, including aerial datasets (DOTA, HRSC2016, UCAS-AOD) and scene text datasets (ICDAR2015, IC-DAR2017MLT), demonstrate the superior performance of OSKDet. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal of OSKDet as a keypoint heatmap-based rotated detector, the exploration of a novel unordered keypoint fusion method, and the introduction of a localization quality uncertainty module.Overall, OSKDet improves the accuracy of rotated object detection by effectively representing the rotated target, eliminating confusion caused by keypoint ordering, and enhancing classification score confidence through keypoint localization distribution.
