This work explores the correlation between voice and face geometry, inspired by recent studies on voice-face matching and cross-modal learning. Previous research in the voice domain has focused on predicting attributes such as speaker identity, age, gender, and emotion. More recent developments have attempted to reconstruct 2D face images from voice. However, the inherent limitations of this approach, including the inability to capture extraneous attributes and the difficulty in quantifying differences between output face images and references, led us to shift our analysis to the 3D domain using mesh representations. Working with 3D meshes allows for more accurate predictions of face geometry unaffected by stylistic variations, hairstyles, background, and facial textures. However, previous research has mainly focused on 3D reconstruction from monocular images or video sequences, while our study is the first to investigate the correlations between 3D face geometry and voices. To facilitate this analysis, we propose a novel dataset called Voxceleb-3D, which includes paired voices and 3D face models. Our analysis framework, called Cross-Modal Perceptionist (CMP), examines the feasibility of predicting face meshes from voices in both supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios. We design metrics to evaluate the geometric fitness based on points, lines, and regions, and our evaluation aims to demonstrate clear correlations between 3D faces and voices using neural network-based approaches. Our research aims to lay the foundations for explainable human-centric cross-modal learning and biometric applications leveraging voice-face correlations, such as security and surveillance. We address several research questions, including the feasibility of predicting face meshes from voices, the stability of mesh predictions across different utterances of the same person, the performance improvement of joint training flow compared to separate methods, and the specific benefits that voice information can bring to the joint training flow. Our contributions include the first exploration of the correlations between face geometry and voices, the development of the CMP framework, and extensive analysis and discussion that validate the correlations between voices and face shapes.
