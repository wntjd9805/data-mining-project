Shadows are a common occurrence in natural scenes and pose challenges for many computer vision tasks. As a result, shadow removal has been a fundamental computer vision task for a long time. Traditional shadow removal methods rely on the priors of shadow images but often struggle to handle shadows in complex scenes. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have dominated the field of shadow removal and achieved significant success. However, most existing methods focus on recovering the shadow region contents from a shadow image and do not consider the color-bias effect. In this paper, we propose a Bijective Mapping Network (BMNet) that accurately recovers the underlying content in the shadow regions. Our BMNet consists of forward and backward mapping procedures, utilizing conditional inputs such as shadow masks and color maps. The forward mapping process aims to learn a nonlinear function to transfer shadow images to their shadow-free version. The reverse mapping procedure serves as a regular constraint and informative supervision for improving the forward mapping performance. To address the color-bias effect, we introduce a Shadow-Invariant Color Guidance Module (SICGM) that integrates both color and mask information into the network in a multi-scale fashion. This module explicitly employs learned shadow-invariant color information to guide color restoration, reducing the color-bias issue. Our contributions include a new shadow removal framework that couples the procedures of shadow removal and generation in a parameters-shared bijective mapping network. We also propose the SICGM module to incorporate shadow-invariant color information for desired color restoration. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance with minimal network parameters and computational costs compared to state-of-the-art methods.
