Unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) is a growing area of research in which person appearance features are learned without annotations. This field has gained popularity due to its practical applications in the real world. Two main approaches in unsupervised learning (USL) Re-ID involve unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and pure USL. This study focuses on investigating the USL Re-ID approach, following a two-stage training procedure that utilizes clustering to generate pseudo labels for the Re-ID model training. However, existing USL methods still suffer from noisy pseudo labels, particularly in sub and mixed clusters. To address this issue, an implicit sample extension (ISE) method called progressive linear interpolation (PLI) is proposed. PLI guides the generation of support samples, which patrol around cluster boundaries and improve the context representation of each cluster. The PLI approach linearly interpolates between actual samples and their K-nearest neighbor clusters in the embedding space, progressively incorporating more context information from farther clusters. A label-preserving contrastive loss (LP) is also introduced to enforce support samples to be close to their original samples and compact each cluster. Experimental results demonstrate that with the help of support samples generated by ISE, the data distribution is refined, and spurious clustering behaviors are alleviated. Moreover, ISE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin and has the advantage of being parameter-free and efficient. Overall, this study contributes a novel strategy for support sample generation in USL Re-ID, demonstrating its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments.
