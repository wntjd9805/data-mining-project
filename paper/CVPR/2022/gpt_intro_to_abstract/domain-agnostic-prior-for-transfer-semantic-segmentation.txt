This paper focuses on the field of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in the context of semantic segmentation. UDA assumes that there is labeled data available in the source domain but not in the target domain. Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning class labels to each pixel in an image. In scenarios where annotations are unavailable, this task becomes more challenging than image-level prediction. The paper proposes a domain-agnostic prior (DAP) to address the issue of domain shift and improve transfer performance. The hypothesis is that the proportion of similar categories in the two domains varies greatly and the border between these categories is difficult to find, making it hard for deep networks to learn discrimination boundaries based on transferred image features. DAP aligns the features from the source and target domains with an auxiliary space through the use of an embedding vector for each class. The DAP is implemented on top of the DACS approach, which uses data augmentation. Two types of domain-agnostic embedding are investigated: one-hot vectors and word2vec features. The effectiveness of DAP is evaluated on two UDA segmentation benchmarks, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. The main contribution of this work is the proposal and implementation of a domain-agnostic prior for UDA segmentation, revealing further potential for improvement in this area.
