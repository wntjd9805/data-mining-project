Learning from raw point clouds has gained significant attention in various applications, such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and robotics. However, dealing with the irregularity of point clouds poses a challenge. Previous approaches, such as Point-Net and PointNet++, focus on point-wise multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to handle irregular points and learn from standalone points. Despite their effectiveness, these methods neglect local shape awareness.Local shapes play a vital role in learning from point clouds. Existing approaches learn from grids, relations, or graphs, but they indirectly learn from shapes by incorporating additional ingredients or employing various transformations. This results in complex preprocessing and significant computations, potentially causing information loss or a lack of geometry representation.To address these limitations, we propose Rep-Surf (representative surfaces) to explicitly represent the local shape of point clouds. Inspired by Taylor Series, we simplify the representation by considering the second derivative, allowing us to approximate the local curve or "surface" in 3D point clouds using its corresponding tangent. RepSurf complements Cartesian coordinates with geometric information and possesses properties of discreteness, explicit locality, and curvature sensitivity.We introduce two versions of RepSurf: Triangular RepSurf and Umbrella RepSurf. Triangular RepSurf is inspired by triangle meshes and reconstructs a triangle for each point using its neighbors, capturing triangle features such as normal vector, surface position, and normalized coordinate. Umbrella RepSurf extends Triangular RepSurf by reconstructing an umbrella surface using K nearest neighbors. We enhance the expressive power of RepSurf by applying a learnable transformation function and aggregation to the triangular features.Our contributions include the introduction of Triangular RepSurf and Umbrella RepSurf as novel representations for point clouds. We also present a high-efficiency plug-and-play module based on RepSurf for point cloud models. Finally, our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various point cloud benchmarks.
