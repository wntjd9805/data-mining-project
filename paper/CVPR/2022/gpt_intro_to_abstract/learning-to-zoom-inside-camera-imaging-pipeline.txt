Digital zoom is crucial for devices with limited optical zoom capability, such as smartphones or consumer-level cameras. It can be implemented either as a built-in feature in the camera preview or as post-processing in editing software. While much research has been done on single image super-resolution (SISR), many existing methods assume simplified degradation models that do not accurately represent real data. Recently, progress has been made in exploring SISR on real data using datasets that bridge the domain gap between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images. In this paper, we propose a new SISR method called ZIC, which works in the RAW-to-RAW domain. This approach focuses solely on increasing image details from RAW to RAW without involving image signal processing units. By working in the RAW domain, ZIC benefits from degradation kernel distributions that are closer to ideal and avoids biases towards specific cameras. Additionally, RAW images offer more flexibility in post-processing due to their original sensor information. To solve the SISR problem in the RAW-to-RAW domain, ZIC formulates a minimization problem that jointly estimates the desired higher-resolution output and a pixel-adaptive degradation kernel map. Inspired by recent advancements in low-level vision tasks, we use subspace constraints to regularize the solution space. To evaluate ZIC, we compare it against existing SISR methods on real datasets, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results demonstrate the superiority of ZIC, with significant improvements in visual quality and generalizability across different sensors.
