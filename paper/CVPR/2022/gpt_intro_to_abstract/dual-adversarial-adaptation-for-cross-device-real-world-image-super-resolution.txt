This paper addresses the challenge of real-world image super-resolution across different devices by proposing a Dual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA) model. The study highlights the distinct device-specific degradation gap observed in cross-device real super-resolution model evaluation. To overcome this issue, the DADA model utilizes unsupervised domain adaptation from the source domain (with paired real data) to the target domain (with only real low-resolution images). The model incorporates the Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) and Intra-domain Adversarial Adaptation (IntraAA) techniques to train the model in a dual architecture, improving its transferability. Extensive experiments on six adaptation settings demonstrate the superior performance of DADA compared to traditional super-resolution methods. This research contributes to the early exploration of unsupervised domain adaptation for real-world image super-resolution across devices, providing a practical solution for realistic applications.
