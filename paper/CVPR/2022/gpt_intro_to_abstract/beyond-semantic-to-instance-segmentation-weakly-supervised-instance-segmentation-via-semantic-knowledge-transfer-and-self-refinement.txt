The recent advancements in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) approaches have shown promising performance improvements by utilizing class activation maps (CAMs) to obtain class-wise localization maps from image-level labels. However, weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) using image-level labels remains an open task as CAMs do not provide instance-wise localization information. Existing WSIS methods rely on off-the-shelf proposal techniques, which are dependent on pre-training with high-level labels such as object or instance information. These methods also suffer from the issue of semantic drift caused by missing instances in the pseudo labels. To address these challenges, we propose a novel WSIS method called BESTIE (BEyond Semantic segmentation To InstancE Segmentation). BESTIE eliminates the dependency on off-the-shelf techniques and mitigates the semantic drift problem. We introduce two innovative components, semantic knowledge transfer and self-refinement, to generate rough pseudo instance labels and refine them in a self-supervised manner. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets without the need for off-the-shelf proposal techniques. We also demonstrate the feasibility of point-supervised instance segmentation with minimal annotation cost. Overall, our contributions include a fully-image-level supervised WSIS method, a semantic knowledge transfer strategy, and a self-refinement method to improve pseudo labels. We also introduce an instance-aware guidance strategy to address the semantic drift problem.
