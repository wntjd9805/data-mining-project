Human Trajectory Prediction (TP) models aim to predict pedestrian movement using trajectory data. However, in real applications, TP data sources are scattered and cannot be shared due to privacy protection, limiting existing TP works. To address this, we propose the ATPFL algorithm, which combines AutoML with federated learning to jointly design and train robust TP models in a distributed and privacy-preserving manner. This approach faces challenges in TP model design and finding suitable FL methods for TP models. To overcome these challenges, we design an AutoML algorithm tailored to the TP area, and a relation-sequence-aware strategy to explore the TP search space efficiently. Additionally, we identify fast convergence methods for evaluating TP model candidates in AutoML and choose the most effective federated training method for training the optimal TP model. Our contributions include constructing a knowledge graph for TP models, breaking data islands and professional restrictions, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ATPFL through extensive experiments.
