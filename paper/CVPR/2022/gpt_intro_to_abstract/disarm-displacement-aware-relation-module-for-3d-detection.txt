Detecting objects from 3D point clouds is crucial in computer vision tasks like autonomous navigation and robotics path planning. This paper introduces a novel neural network module called Displacement Aware Relation Module (DisARM) to improve 3D object detection. DisARM encodes critical relations between objects explicitly, allowing for richer information during training. The module includes a relation anchor module that samples representative proposals as anchors and a dynamic weighing mechanism based on spatial and feature displacement. This approach effectively extracts valid information from redundant relations in complex scenes. The proposed module can be easily integrated into existing 3D object detection methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D.
