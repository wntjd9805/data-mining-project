Automatic body reshaping in portrait photography retouching is a challenging task due to the complex structure and appearance of human bodies. While there are existing solutions such as rule-based and 3D model-based methods, they have limitations in terms of quality and efficiency. Deep generative technology has shown promise in synthesizing person images, but struggles with photorealism and alignment. Flow-based models have also been explored, but they are often limited in resolution and performance. To address these challenges, we propose a structure-aware flow generation framework for body reshaping. This framework utilizes body skeletons and Part Affinity Fields (PAFs) as structural priors to guide flow generation and incorporates a Structure Affinity Self-Attention (SASA) mechanism to capture long-range perceptual correlations and structural associations. Our method generates globally coherent and locally smooth flow fields, which are then used for reshaping the body through warping. Furthermore, our approach is designed to handle high-resolution images efficiently. To enable research in this area, we introduce the BR-5K dataset, which includes 5,000 individual portrait photos along with their retouched targets edited by professional artists. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visual quality, controllability, and efficiency. The contributions of this paper are the development of a 2D end-to-end structure-aware flow generation framework, the use of skeletons and PAFs as structural priors, the introduction of a compositional attention mechanism (SASA) for manipulation consistency, and the creation of the BR-5K dataset.
