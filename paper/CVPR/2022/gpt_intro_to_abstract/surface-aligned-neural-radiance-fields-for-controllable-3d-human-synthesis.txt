Human body modeling is an important topic with various real-world applications, especially in visual applications like movies and games. The ability to control properties such as pose, shape, and clothes in 3D human models is highly desirable. However, manually designing high-quality 3D models is labor-intensive, leading to an increasing number of studies proposing the reconstruction of these models using 2D observations.Early approaches in human body modeling used skeleton deformation or parametric models to reconstruct rough human meshes with pose and body shape estimation. While these parametric models have good controllable properties, they face limitations in representing clothed humans when the actual shape differs significantly from the base mesh estimation.Recently, neural radiance fields (NeRF) have emerged as a promising approach for 3D scene representation and reconstruction. NeRF represents a scene using a neural network to regress color and density at a query point. Several approaches have proposed combining NeRF with statistical 3D human models and pose estimation to improve the reconstruction results. These approaches differ in how they transform and represent query points.In this paper, we propose a new approach for dynamic human reconstruction by combining parametric 3D body models, such as SMPL, with NeRF. Our approach builds a NeRF on the mesh surface by mapping query points to surface points with signed height. This surface-aligned NeRF can be easily deformed or controlled according to the base SMPL model.Our approach offers several advantages. Firstly, it does not rely on a learned deformation field, reducing the number of learned parameters. Secondly, the reconstructed models can be directly controlled by SMPL parameters, including poses and body shapes. Finally, the surface-aligned property of our approach results in better generalization performance for novel human pose synthesis.In summary, our contributions include the development of an algorithm that maps spatial points to a novel surface-aligned representation and the proposal of surface-aligned neural radiance fields using this mapping. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization performance for novel views and poses while supporting manipulations of body shape and clothes.
