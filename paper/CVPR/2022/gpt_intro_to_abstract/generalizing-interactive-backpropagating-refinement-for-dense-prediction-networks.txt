Deep learning has greatly improved dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, these automatic methods do not provide a way for users to make corrections on the estimated output. To enable user interactions, previous works have used user inputs in the form of distance maps and trimaps as network input. However, deep networks are still capable of generating predictions inconsistent with the user-provided inputs. This paper investigates if a pretrained dense prediction method can be converted into an interactive method without retraining. The authors propose a Generalized Backpropagating Refinement Scheme (G-BRS) that enables both global and localized refinement using a channel-weighted bias map. They also introduce a novel consistency loss with an attention mechanism to stabilize the refinement process and provide more user control. The G-BRS method is evaluated on four state-of-the-art models for a range of dense prediction tasks and achieves significant improvement with interactive clicks. This research opens up possibilities for equipping automatic methods with interactive features.
