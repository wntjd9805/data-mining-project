Self-supervised learning (SSL) has significantly advanced natural language processing and computer vision by learning strong representations from unlabeled data. In computer vision, the success of SSL is largely attributed to instance discrimination and the contrastive objective. However, existing self-supervised methods in video domain do not effectively utilize temporal evolutions and scene context. This paper introduces Contextualized Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning (ConST-CL) to address these limitations. ConST-CL learns discriminative local representations by considering both instance and context features in a video. The proposed framework is evaluated on various downstream tasks, including holistic and local video tasks, and shows superior performance compared to recent methods. The main contributions of this work include a region-based contrastive learning framework, a contextualized region prediction task, an effective network design for simultaneous holistic and local representation learning, and competitive performance on several benchmarks.
