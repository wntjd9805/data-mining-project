The world is facing a growing waste crisis, with estimates predicting a significant increase in waste production by 2030. Efficient recycling is crucial to mitigate the environmental impact of this rising waste. Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs) play a central role in the recycling process, but despite the use of machines and manual labor, recycling rates remain low. This paper addresses the challenges faced by MRFs, including low recycling rates, safety risks for workers, and the difficulty of automating waste detection. Recent advancements in object classification and segmentation present an opportunity to improve the efficiency, profitability, and safety of the recycling process. However, the lack of high-quality, in-the-wild datasets limits the development and evaluation of these algorithms for industrial waste sorting. Existing datasets are either limited in size or do not adequately represent the complexity of the recycling domain. To address this gap, the authors propose ZeroWaste, the largest openly available in-the-wild waste detection dataset specifically designed for industrial waste sorting. This dataset includes densely annotated frames for training and evaluation, as well as a large number of unlabeled frames for semi- and self-supervised learning methods. The authors also introduce a before-after data collection setup and a binary classification dataset, ZeroWaste-w, to facilitate weakly supervised detection and segmentation research. Experimental results demonstrate the challenging nature of the dataset and highlight the need for new and more robust methods to address this problem effectively in real waste sorting plants. The proposed dataset aims to enable researchers to develop data-efficient algorithms for waste detection and related challenges beyond human-centric domains. The contributions of this paper include proposing the ZeroWaste dataset, introducing various versions and setups, implementing semi-baselines and weakly-supervised methods, and highlighting the limitations of popular detection and segmentation approaches in this domain.
