With the increasing popularity of online videos, there is a growing interest in video understanding. Humans naturally perceive event boundaries and divide videos into meaningful units. The Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) task aims to locate these event boundaries to improve video understanding. The challenge lies in modeling the diverse patterns of event boundaries, which include spatial and temporal diversities. Spatial diversity involves changes in appearance, while temporal diversity relates to actions and their varying speeds and durations. Motion information is crucial for perceiving temporal variations and detecting event boundaries. Previous methods have used optical flow as a motion representation but have focused on local motion cues and lacked effective fusion across appearance and motion modalities. In this paper, we propose a method called DDM-Net that progressively aggregates dense motion information with appearance cues to perceive event boundaries. The proposed method includes three improvements: a Multi-Level Feature Bank to capture changes at different spatial and temporal scales, a Dense Difference Map (DDM) to model rich temporal contexts, and Progressive Attention to effectively aggregate appearance and motion clues. The DDM-Net leverages multi-level dense differences and progressive attention to improve the discrimination of event boundaries. The effectiveness of DDM-Net is evaluated on two datasets, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, and compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that DDM-Net outperforms existing methods on all evaluation metrics, achieving superior performance and a significant boost in F1 scores. Additionally, DDM-Net outperforms the winners of the LOVEU Challenge@CVPR 2021 on the Kinetics-GEBD dataset, further validating its effectiveness. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the proposal of dense difference maps with a multi-level feature bank, the use of progressive attention for effective feature aggregation, and the achievement of state-of-the-art performance on Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS benchmarks.
