Abstract:Content moderation is an essential component of online photo sharing platforms to prevent the propagation of harmful images. While some moderation can be automated, complex data like memes and misinformation require manual moderation. However, manually moderating each copy of a viral image is time-consuming and unnecessary. To address this, this paper focuses on the task of re-identifying images for automated handling.Image re-identification poses two challenges: the scale of copy detection systems and the need for a hard match/non-match decision. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces the Self Supervised Copy Detection (SSCD) approach, which utilizes short descriptor vectors for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search. The architecture of SSCD includes differential entropy regularization to promote a uniform embedding distribution, which ensures comparability between distances from different embedding regions and avoids embedding collapse. Furthermore, score normalization is incorporated into the image descriptor to improve ranking metrics.The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SSCD in image copy detection and anticipates that it will establish a strong single-model baseline. The authors plan to release the code and models for their method. The related works, motivation for entropy loss, detailed description of SSCD, experimental results, and observations on the copy detection task are presented in the subsequent sections.Overall, this paper addresses the challenge of automating the re-identification of copied images, providing a potential solution for efficient and effective content moderation on online photo sharing platforms.
