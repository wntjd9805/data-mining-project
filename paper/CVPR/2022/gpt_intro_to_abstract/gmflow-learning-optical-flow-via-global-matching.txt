In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for optical flow estimation by reformulating it as a global matching problem. Traditionally, optical flow has been regressed using convolutions and local cost volumes, which limits its ability to handle large displacements. To address this limitation, we propose the GMFlow framework, which leverages a Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature matching, and a self-attention layer for flow propagation. We also introduce a refinement step to exploit higher resolution features for residual flow estimation. Our experimental results on the Sintel benchmark demonstrate that GMFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods like RAFT while using fewer refinements and running faster. This work presents a new paradigm for accurate and efficient flow estimation by completely revamping the traditional regression pipeline.
