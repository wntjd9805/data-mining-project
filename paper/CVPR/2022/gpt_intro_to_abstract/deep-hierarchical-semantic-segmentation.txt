Semantic segmentation is a critical step in achieving intelligent scene understanding. However, most existing segmentation models assume that target classes are disjoint and do not consider the structured nature of the visual world. In human cognition, structured understanding in terms of relations and hierarchies is essential. Inspired by this, we propose a novel approach called hierarchical semantic segmentation (HSS). In HSS, classes are organized in a tree-shaped hierarchy, capturing the general-to-specific relations between classes. Our algorithm, HSSN, directly formulates HSS as a pixel-wise multi-label classification task, allowing for easy adaptation of existing segmentation models. HSSN also makes full use of the class hierarchy in network learning by imposing hierarchy constraints on segmentation predictions, enforcing them to obey the hierarchy structure. Additionally, HSSN utilizes the class hierarchy to encode structured knowledge into the pixel embedding space, facilitating hierarchical representation learning. We evaluate HSSN on four public benchmarks, achieving promising results with different segmentation network architectures and backbones. Our work represents a significant step towards hierarchical semantic segmentation, offering a principled approach that can be easily incorporated into existing segmentation networks.
