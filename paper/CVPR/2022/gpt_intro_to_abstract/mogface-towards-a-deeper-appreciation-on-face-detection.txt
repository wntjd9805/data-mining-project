Face detection plays a crucial role in various facial downstream tasks, such as face alignment, face recognition, and face attribute analysis. In recent years, there has been significant progress in general object detectors, leading to the adoption of their architecture designs in state-of-the-art face detectors. However, existing label assignment and scale-level data augmentation strategies used in generic object detectors do not provide significant improvements for face detection. Face detection also faces the challenge of distinguishing false alarms from true positive faces. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive online incremental anchor mining strategy (Ali-AMS) for label assignment, a selective scale enhancement strategy for scale-level data augmentation, and a Hierarchical Context-Aware Module (HCAM) for eliminating false alarms. The proposed strategies are evaluated on popular face detection benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. The contributions of this work include the exploration of three important research topics in face detection and the development of a promising face detector, termed Mog-Face.
