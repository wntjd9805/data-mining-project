Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging research topic in low-level computer vision. Many SISR models are trained using deep neural networks (DNNs) with pixel-wise losses, such as ℓ1 and ℓ2, as well as local window-based metrics like structural similarity index (SSIM). However, these losses fail to produce rich image details. In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have gained attention for GAN-based SISR (GAN-SR) due to their potential to recover sharp images with rich details. However, adversarial training often introduces unpleasant visual artifacts. This paper focuses on inhibiting these artifacts without sacrificing realistic details. The authors categorize GAN-SR results into three types of regions based on their ease of reconstruction and presence of fine-scale details. They propose a Locally Discriminative Learning (LDL) framework to penalize artifacts while preserving realistic details using a pixel-wise map and model ensemble strategy. Their method demonstrates improvements in both quantitative and qualitative SISR tasks compared to existing approaches. Overall, this paper provides a simple yet effective approach to suppress GAN-SR artifacts and generate realistic details.
