Depth estimation from images has been a popular and extensively researched technique in computer vision. Stereo vision is one of the most widely used image-based approaches for depth estimation. With the availability of challenging stereo benchmarks, significant progress has been made in this field. Deep learning techniques have also been successfully applied to stereo vision, resulting in high-precision depth estimation.However, despite these advancements, there are still open challenges in the field of stereo vision. Two particular challenges are non-Lambertian surfaces and high-resolution images. Non-Lambertian surfaces, such as transparent or specular materials, present difficulties for both traditional computer vision methodologies and deep learning approaches. These types of surfaces are often absent or unlabeled in most stereo benchmarks, making it challenging to train and evaluate models on these types of surfaces. High-resolution images, on the other hand, introduce additional complexities due to their larger dimensions and increased number of occluded and untextured pixels. Processing high-resolution images with deep networks also poses computational complexity issues.To address these challenges, the authors of this paper propose a novel high-resolution challenging stereo benchmark. This dataset contains images captured in indoor environments with a variety of objects and surfaces that are either specular or transparent, as well as large untextured regions. To accurately annotate the dataset, a novel deep space-time stereo pipeline is implemented, which combines disparity estimates computed from multiple static images. The pipeline uses a pretrained deep network to compute the disparity accumulation through time within the space-time framework.The paper also introduces a semi-automatic data annotation process based on the deep space-time stereo framework. In addition to ground-truth disparities, manually annotated segmentation maps are provided to identify and rank the hard-to-match materials based on specularity and transparency. The authors also evaluate the state-of-the-art stereo networks on the proposed dataset, highlighting the open challenges in stereo vision and providing insights for future research directions.The proposed benchmark, named Booster, consists of both high-resolution and unbalanced stereo pairs, along with dense ground-truth disparities and manually annotated segmentation maps. The dataset is accompanied by a website where researchers can access and evaluate their algorithms. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of stereo vision by addressing the open challenges of non-Lambertian surfaces and high-resolution images, providing a new benchmark dataset, and evaluating state-of-the-art methods.
