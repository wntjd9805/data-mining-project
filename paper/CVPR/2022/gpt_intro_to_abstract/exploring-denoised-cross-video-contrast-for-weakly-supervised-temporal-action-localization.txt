Temporal action localization is a fundamental and challenging computer vision task that involves identifying the occurrences of specific actions within untrimmed videos. This task has gained significant research attention due to its applications in various areas such as surveillance, video summarization, and highlight detection. While existing methods rely on fully-supervised training with densely annotated frame labels, weakly-supervised temporal action localization, or WS-TAL, has emerged as an alternative approach that utilizes video-level tags for supervision. However, due to the sparsity of video-level labels, the snippet-wise classifications in WS-TAL often result in errors, leading to suboptimal localization performance.In this paper, we propose the Denoised Cross-video Contrastive (DCC) algorithm, which aims to enhance the discrimination ability of snippet features in weakly-supervised TAL. Our algorithm consists of three key ideas. Firstly, we introduce a pseudo-label denoising (PLD) module to address the noisy contrastive features caused by incorrect pseudo-labels. By down-weighting the confidence scores of these incorrect labels, more accurate contrastive features are generated. Secondly, we propose a region-level feature contrast strategy that captures "global" contrast across the entire dataset. This strategy, along with a region-level memory bank, allows our model to maintain informative features throughout the dataset. Lastly, we introduce a diverse contrastive training strategy that promotes action-background separation, inter-class separability, and intra-class compactness.Our DCC algorithm is performed during training and does not incur additional computational cost during inference. Experimental results on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, we observe a 16.7% improvement in average mAP of IoU thresholds from 0.1 to 0.7 on THUMOS14. Overall, our algorithm significantly enhances the discrimination ability of snippet features in weakly-supervised TAL and improves the localization performance.
