Image inpainting is a technique that aims to fill missing regions in corrupted images with semantically appropriate and visually faithful content. Recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to breakthroughs in image inpainting, with most methods utilizing single feed-forward approaches. However, these methods still struggle with processing images with large missing areas or generating results with good semantics. As an alternative, GAN inversion inpainting methods have shown promising results in addressing these challenges. These methods use pretrained generative models to provide semantic priors and invert the latent code back to a complete image. Two strategies are commonly employed: optimization-based and learning-based. Optimization-based methods achieve high-quality results, but suffer from long inference times, while learning-based methods rely on an encoder network to infer the latent code and struggle to find accurate latent codes in a single inference. To address the limitations of both feed-forward and GAN inversion inpainting methods, a hybrid inpainting framework is proposed in this paper. The framework consists of two paths: a feed-forward path and an inversion path. In the inversion path, a latent code is sought in the latent space that produces an inverted image with the closest distance to the observed region in the corrupted image. A learning-based strategy is adopted to efficiently infer the latent code. To ensure inpainting quality, useful knowledge from the inversion path is transferred to the feed-forward path. In the feed-forward path, an auto-encoder network is used to inpaint the corrupted image, integrating multi-scale features from the inversion path into the decoder. A novel deformable fusion module is proposed to align the features from the two paths, addressing any misalignment issues. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, producing semantically reasonable and high-fidelity results. In summary, the contributions of this work include the proposal of a hybrid dual-path inpainting framework that utilizes GAN inversion to assist feed-forward inpainting, the introduction of a novel deformable fusion module to address misalignment issues, and the demonstration of superior performance compared to existing methods.
