Group Activity Recognition (GAR) is a crucial task in video understanding, requiring the recognition of both individual actions and collective activities of multiple actors. To effectively learn spatio-temporal actor relations for GAR, several approaches have been proposed to model actor relations using visual attention. However, joint spatial-temporal optimization is often challenging, leading recent approaches to separate spatial-temporal attention for modeling actor interaction. Nevertheless, a single order of space and time is insufficient to capture the diverse spatio-temporal interactions observed in different group activities.This paper introduces a Dual-path Actor Interaction (Dual-AI) framework for GAR that integrates two complementary spatio-temporal views to learn complex actor relations in videos. The framework consists of Spatial-Temporal (ST) and Temporal-Spatial (TS) Interaction Paths, aided by spatial and temporal transformers. The ST path first utilizes a spatial transformer to capture spatial relations among actors in each frame, followed by a temporal transformer to model temporal evolution. Conversely, the TS path arranges the transformers in a reverse order. This allows the framework to leverage both paths and generate robust spatio-temporal contexts for improving GAR performance.Additionally, a Multi-scale Actor Contrastive Loss (MAC-Loss) is introduced as a concise yet effective self-supervised signal to enhance actor consistency between the two paths. By supervising the actors at different levels (frame-frame, frame-video, and video-video), confusions between individual actors are reduced, resulting in improved discriminative power in GAR.Extensive experiments were conducted on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that the proposed Dual-AI framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on fully-annotated datasets such as Volleyball and Collective Activity. Notably, the framework performs competitively with recent approaches trained with 100% training data, even with only 50% training data. Moreover, the framework also achieves state-of-the-art results on datasets with limited actor supervision, such as Weak-Volleyball-M and NBA. These results affirm the effectiveness of the Dual-AI framework in learning spatio-temporal actor relations for GAR.
