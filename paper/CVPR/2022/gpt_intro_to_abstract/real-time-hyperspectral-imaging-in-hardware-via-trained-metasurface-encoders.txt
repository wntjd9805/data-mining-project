Hyperspectral imaging has gained interest in various fields due to its ability to estimate spectral features and remotely sense complex materials. However, current hyperspectral imaging techniques suffer from expensive setup costs, slow data processing, and the need for macroscopic components. To address these issues, this paper introduces the Hyplex™ system, a data-driven hyperspectral imaging camera that utilizes metasurfaces to replace macroscopic components with integrated dielectric nanoresonators. The system compresses high-dimensional spectral data into a low-dimensional space using projectors defined through end-to-end learning of large hyperspectral datasets. The system encodes spectral information into a barcode composed of intensity signals, and a physical model-aware framework finds the optimal projectors' response based on user-defined tasks. The paper presents the implementation of the Hyplex™ system, an end-to-end framework for hyperspectral semantic image segmentation and spectral reconstruction, and a benchmark against the state-of-the-art. Additionally, the paper introduces FVgNET, a publicly available dataset of labeled hyperspectral images for semantic segmentation and classification.
