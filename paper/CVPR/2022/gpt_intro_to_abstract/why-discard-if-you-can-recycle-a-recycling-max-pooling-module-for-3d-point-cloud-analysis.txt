The paper discusses the analysis of 3D point cloud data in various application areas such as autonomous driving and robotics. Traditional Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) cannot be directly applied to 3D point cloud data due to its unordered and varying cardinality nature. PointNet is a pioneering work in 3D point cloud analysis that uses max-pooling to obtain permutation-invariant features. However, existing approaches that employ max-pooling discard a significant portion of points, leading to inefficient use of computational resources. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel Recycling Max-Pooling (RMP) module that recycles the discarded features to enhance network performance. The main contributions of the work are: 1) highlighting the wastefulness of discarding informative features, 2) proposing the RMP module for recycling discarded point features, and 3) providing extensive experimental results that demonstrate the improved performance of networks with the RMP module. The results are evaluated on various datasets and tasks, showing consistent improvements in point cloud classification and indoor point cloud semantic segmentation.
