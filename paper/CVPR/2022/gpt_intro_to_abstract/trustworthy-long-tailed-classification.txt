In many real-world applications, data is distributed in a long-tailed manner across different categories. The frequency of these categories varies greatly, with some classes having a large number of training samples (head classes) and others having very few (tail classes). In addition to this class imbalance, there may also be new categories that the models have not encountered before, which are referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Long-tailed classification is a challenging task as models need to handle few-shot learning for tail classes and also deal with OOD data. Existing algorithms have attempted to address this by rebalancing the training of different classes, transferring knowledge between head and tail classes, or employing ensembling techniques. However, these methods have limitations, particularly in terms of reliable prediction and the computational cost associated with training multiple experts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Trustworthy Long-tailed Classification (TLC) method that combines classification and uncertainty estimation in a unified framework. We introduce evidence-based uncertainty (EvU) under the Dempster-Shafer Evidence Theory to identify hard samples, detect tail and OOD samples, and identify potentially wrong predictions. We also propose a multi-expert fusion strategy based on uncertainty to improve classification performance and trustworthiness. Additionally, we dynamically reduce the number of engaged experts for easy samples to improve efficiency while maintaining promising performances. Our contributions include the introduction of EvU to promote trustworthiness in long-tailed classification, the development of a multi-expert fusion strategy based on uncertainty, and the achievement of efficiency in training multiple experts. We conduct experiments and evaluate the proposed TLC method on classification tasks, tail and OOD sample detection, and failure prediction, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. The code for our method is publicly available.
