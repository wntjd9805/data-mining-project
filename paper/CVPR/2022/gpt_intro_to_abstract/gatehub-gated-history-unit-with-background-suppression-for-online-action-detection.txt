Online action detection is a crucial task in various applications such as autonomous driving, public safety, and virtual and augmented reality. Unlike offline action detection, where the entire video is available for analysis, online action detection faces the challenge of predicting actions in a streaming video as they occur. This paper addresses the issue of accurately predicting actions in online settings by proposing a novel approach. The authors demonstrate that the traditional cross-attention mechanism used in action detection does not effectively capture the informative history frames for predicting actions in the current frame. To overcome this limitation, they introduce a new method that improves the correlation between history frames and current frame prediction. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on a dataset, and the results show improved accuracy in online action detection compared to existing methods. This research contributes to the advancement of online action detection techniques and can benefit applications related to autonomous driving, public safety, and virtual and augmented reality.
