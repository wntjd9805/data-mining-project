Generative learning aims to model complex real-world data distributions in order to synthesize high-fidelity data from random vectors drawn from a prior distribution. Existing generative methods, such as autoregressive models, Variation-al Auto-Encoders (VAE), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have achieved impressive performance in synthesizing high-quality images. However, these methods struggle to capture the subtle distinctions among fine-grained classes. Enlarging the latent space is an effective strategy for improving GANs in capturing the factors of variation in fine-grained data. This paper introduces SphericGAN, a semi-supervised GAN with a hyper-spherical latent space for class-conditional generative learning on fine-grained data. SphericGAN utilizes a mapping network and a prototypical discriminator to enhance the capability of the generator in capturing both class-independent and class-related variation factors. The proposed hyper-spherical latent space is learned by clustering real instances and aligning the latent vectors with the prior clusters of real data. A prototypical discriminator is incorporated to match the clusters of real and synthesized instances in semantics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hyper-spherical latent space in improving the class-conditional synthesis quality of fine-grained data. The contributions of this work include the exploration of semi-supervised class-conditional fine-grained image generation from the perspective of a hyper-spherical latent space, the incorporation of a mapping network and prototypical discriminator to learn the underlying data structure, and the achievement of superior performance on multiple standard benchmarks.
