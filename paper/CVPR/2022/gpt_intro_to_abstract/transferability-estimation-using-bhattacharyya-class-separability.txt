Transfer learning is an important technique in computer vision that aims to reuse knowledge from a source task to improve training on a target task. In the current state of transfer learning, the most common approach is to pre-train a source model on a well-known dataset and then fine-tune it on the target dataset. However, different target tasks may benefit from different source model architectures or datasets. The challenge lies in determining which source model is most suitable for a specific target task.To address this problem, recent works have introduced transferability metrics that predict how well a source model transfers to a given target dataset. These metrics are computationally efficient and correlate with the final performance of the model after fine-tuning. Typically, transferability metrics are estimated by applying the source model to the target dataset and measuring embeddings or predictions.This paper proposes a novel transferability metric called the Gaussian Bhattacharyya Coefficient (GBC). The GBC measures the overlap between target classes in the feature space of the source model. If the overlap is small, it indicates that the knowledge in the source model is useful for the target task and the transfer will be successful. Conversely, if the overlap is large, it suggests that the target classes are difficult to separate and the transfer will be ineffective.To estimate the overlap, the feature extractor of the source model is applied to the target dataset, and each target class is modeled as a Gaussian distribution in the feature space. Regularization techniques are applied to accurately represent each class, and the sum of overlaps between target classes is measured using the Bhattacharyya coefficient.Experiments are conducted on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks to evaluate the performance of GBC compared to other transferability metrics. The results demonstrate that GBC outperforms state-of-the-art metrics such as LEEP, LogME, and H-score. Additionally, GBC is shown to be computationally efficient.In summary, this paper introduces the GBC transferability metric, which measures the overlap between target classes in the source feature space. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over other metrics and its effectiveness in realistic transfer learning scenarios.
