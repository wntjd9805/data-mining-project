This paper introduces the concept of Continuous Scene Representations (CSR) for embodied agents operating within a scene. The goal is to provide a comprehensive representation of the surroundings that captures not only object identities, but also relationships between objects and between the agent and its surroundings. Traditional scene graphs are limited by their reliance on manual annotation and a fixed set of relationships. The paper proposes CSR as a more suitable approach that represents object relationships as continuous vectors and updates the representation on-the-fly as the agent moves. The paper also presents a simple strategy for planning with respect to the CSR representation. To construct the scene representation, the paper proposes learning object relational embeddings via a contrastive loss. Experimental results show that CSR outperforms map-based, reinforcement, and imitation learning baselines, captures discrete relations, effectively captures spatial relationships, and tracks objects over time in real-world scenarios.
