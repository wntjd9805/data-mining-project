Color constancy is a critical problem in computer vision, as it aims to separate illumination color from observation to obtain images captured under achromatic illumination. While human vision has inherent color constancy ability, achieving color constancy in digital photography remains challenging. Some existing approaches use statistical knowledge about objects or illuminations in scenes, such as the gray-world and white-patch methods. However, these methods often fail to account for natural scene variations, leading to suboptimal results. Data-driven algorithms, including those using deep neural networks (DNNs), have also been proposed, but they heavily rely on the quality of training data.This paper introduces the concept of polarization as a means to solve the color constancy problem. By analyzing the behavior of diffuse and specular polarization, the authors demonstrate that the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) can effectively identify achromatic pixels regardless of the illumination colors. Experimental results on a diverse set of illumination conditions show the significant contribution of DoLP to color constancy.The proposed approach offers several advantages. It is robust and does not rely on statistical knowledge, optimization, or training processes. It accurately considers diffuse polarization, which is often neglected in previous methods. The authors also explore the estimation of illuminations from chromatic pixels and solve the problem of multi-illumination scenes. Their method achieves state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost. Additionally, the authors provide their codes and evaluation data for public access, aiming to foster further advancements in color constancy research.
