Image super-resolution is a challenging problem in computer vision, with applications in various domains. In this paper, we focus on single image super-resolution (SISR), where the goal is to restore high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Most existing approaches rely on a two-stage framework involving kernel estimation and HR image restoration. However, these methods suffer from two main drawbacks: inaccurate kernel estimation and insufficient utilization of estimated kernels.To address these issues, we propose a modified learning strategy for blind SR. We reformulate the degradation model to separate kernel estimation and image upsampling. This allows us to estimate the kernel without aliasing ambiguity in the LR space. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic deep linear kernel (DDLK) that offers more choices for optimal kernel solutions, making the learning process easier. We also introduce a novel deconvolution module called deep constrained least squares (DCLS), which efficiently deblurs the features while preserving spatial relation information.Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We achieve state-of-the-art performance in blind SR problems, surpassing existing methods. The contributions of this work include: a practical degradation model that enables accurate kernel estimation from low-resolution space, the use of dynamic deep linear kernels for improved learning, the introduction of the DCLS deconvolution module for channel-wise deblurring, and extensive experiments validating the superiority of our method. Overall, our approach shows promise in significantly enhancing the quality of super-resolved images.
