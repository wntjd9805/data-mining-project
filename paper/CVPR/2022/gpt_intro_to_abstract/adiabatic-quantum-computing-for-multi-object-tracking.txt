Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a challenging task in computer vision that involves solving NP-hard assignment problems. Various approaches have been proposed, including problem formulation with domain knowledge, approximate solvers, and the combination of deep learning and heuristics. However, integer assignment problems remain difficult optimization tasks. Quantum computing has recently shown promise in solving optimization problems, offering a new way to tackle MOT. In this paper, we propose a quantum computing approach to MOT, representing the assignment problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization task and implementing it on an adiabatic quantum computer (AQC). By finding the lowest energy state of the quantum system, we can obtain a solution to the optimization problem. We highlight the advantages, challenges, and requirements of mapping MOT to an AQC. Our contributions include a competitive quantum computing formulation of MOT, a method for finding Lagrange multipliers to improve solution probability with minimal measurements, and extensive experiments using a D-wave AQC on both synthetic and real data. The paper is structured as follows: we discuss related work, introduce the basics of quantum computing, present our MOT formulation optimized for AQC, describe the modifications for classical computing, and finally present experiments and results on a D-wave quantum computer.
