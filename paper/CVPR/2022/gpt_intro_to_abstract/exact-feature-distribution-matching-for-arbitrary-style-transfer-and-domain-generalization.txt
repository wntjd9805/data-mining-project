Distribution matching is a popular problem in statistical learning, especially in the context of deep models. Matching the distribution of deep features has gained interest for its effectiveness in complex vision tasks, such as arbitrary style transfer and domain generalization. Existing methods typically match feature mean and standard deviation under the assumption of Gaussian distribution. However, real-world feature distributions are often more complex and cannot be accurately modeled by Gaussian. This motivates the need for more effective methods, specifically Exact Feature Distribution Matching (EFDM), that consider high-order statistics of features. While high-order central moments have been used to match distributions precisely, it introduces high computational overhead and is impractical for large feature sets. To address this, we propose the use of the empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (eCDF) and introduce the Exact Histogram Matching algorithm as an auxiliary measurement to minimize feature distribution divergence. This approach allows for exact matching of eCDFs and consequently exact matching of mean, standard deviation, and high-order statistics. We illustrate the limitations of Histogram Matching (HM) in exact matching and propose Sort-Matching as a fast algorithm for efficient EFDM. With EFDM, we can perform cross-distribution feature matching and introduce a new style loss for accurate distribution divergence measurement in arbitrary style transfer tasks. Additionally, EFDM can be extended to generate feature augmentations with mixed styles, enabling diverse feature augmentations for domain generalization applications. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various arbitrary style transfer and domain generalization tasks, demonstrating its high efficiency and accuracy.
