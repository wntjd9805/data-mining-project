Video object segmentation (VOS) is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to obtain pixel-level masks of objects in a video sequence. Although state-of-the-art methods achieve high accuracy in segmenting objects, they often suffer from significant computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accelerate VOS by leveraging compressed videos. Most videos on the internet are stored and transmitted in a compressed format, which provides valuable information for VOS. Specifically, the frame type and motion vectors present in a compressed video can be utilized to approximate keyframes and optical flow, respectively. We develop a propagation-based framework that applies an off-the-shelf base network to keyframes and propagates the segmentations and features to non-keyframes using motion vectors. To handle the limitations of motion vectors, such as sparsity and block artifacts, we introduce a soft propagation module and a mask correction module based on residuals. Our experimental results show that our approach achieves significant speed-ups with minor accuracy drops compared to existing methods. Additionally, our framework reduces the memory consumption of memory-networks, which are state-of-the-art VOS methods. Overall, our contributions include a VOS acceleration module that leverages information from compressed videos for segmentation mask propagation and correction, a soft propagation module for accurate warping, and a mask correction module to refine errors and artifacts. Our plug-and-play module can be applied to existing VOS methods, achieving considerable speed-ups without sacrificing accuracy.
