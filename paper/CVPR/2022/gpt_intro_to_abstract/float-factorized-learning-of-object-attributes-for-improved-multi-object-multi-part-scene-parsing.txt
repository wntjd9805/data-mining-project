Semantic scene parsing is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to segment objects and "stuff" regions in an image. However, the more challenging problem of multi-object multi-part parsing, which requires part-level segmentation of each scene object, has not been adequately addressed. Existing approaches either focus on single-object part parsing or treat part labels as independent, failing to leverage the ontological relationships among objects and parts. Additionally, they often perform poorly on smaller and infrequent parts. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes FLOAT, a novel factorized label space framework for scalable multi-object multi-part parsing. The framework takes advantage of the fact that object part names often consist of a root component and side component(s), enabling grouping of parts based on their root component. Similarly, object categories that share category-level attributes can be grouped together. This factorization of the label space significantly enhances scalability and increases the effective number of output labels. Furthermore, the framework introduces IZR, an inference-time segmentation refinement technique that enhances segmentation quality, especially for smaller objects/parts. Unlike alternate inference-time schemes, IZR does not require additional training and achieves superior performance. The paper also presents Pascal-Part-201, an enhanced version of the Pascal-Part dataset that includes previously excluded part attributes and minor parts, making it the most comprehensive and challenging version available. In addition to standard evaluation metrics like mean IOU, the paper introduces sqIOU and sqAvg as normalized segmentation quality measures that are less affected by the spatial scale of objects and parts. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of FLOAT on Pascal-Part-201 compared to existing approaches. The framework's ability to handle multi-object multi-part parsing, its scalable label space factorization, and the efficacy of the inference-time refinement technique make it a valuable contribution to the field of semantic scene parsing.
