This paper presents ZebraPose, a two-stage RGB-based approach for 6DoF object pose estimation. The first stage involves assigning a unique descriptor to each 3D vertex, using a novel coarse-to-fine surface encoding method. This method efficiently encodes the surfaces and exploits traditional outlier filters. In the second stage, a dense correspondence between 2D pixels and 3D vertices is predicted using a hierarchical classification task. A novel hierarchical training loss and strategy adjust the weights of each code position. The proposed approach is evaluated on the LM-O and YCB-V datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results in 6DoF pose estimation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ZebraPose in accurately determining the location and pose of objects of interest in augmented reality and robotics applications.
