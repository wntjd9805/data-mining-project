This paper introduces the concept of open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) and proposes a novel method called detection prompt (DetPro) to learn prompt representations in OVOD with a pre-trained vision-language model (OVOD-VLM). The authors highlight the limitations of current approaches, which rely on manual prompt engineering and lack inclusion of negative proposals. To address these challenges, DetPro includes a background interpretation scheme for negative proposal inclusion and a context grading scheme with tailored positive proposals. The DetPro approach is evaluated on the LVIS dataset and demonstrates superior performance compared to the existing ViLD method, with significant improvements in average precision (AP) for both bounding box and mask detection. The experiments also demonstrate the transferability of the LVIS-trained model to other datasets such as Pascal VOC, COCO, and Objects365. Overall, the results indicate that DetPro is an effective approach for open-vocabulary object detection, offering improvements in detection performance and reducing the manual effort required for prompt engineering.
