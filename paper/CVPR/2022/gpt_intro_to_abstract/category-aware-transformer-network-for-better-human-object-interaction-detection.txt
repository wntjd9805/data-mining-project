Detecting human-object interactions (HOIs) is essential for various computer vision tasks. This paper explores the use of transformer-based models for HOI detection and proposes a Category-Aware Transformer Network (CATN) to improve the performance of these models. The CATN consists of two modules: the Category Aware Module (CAM) and the Category-Level Attention Module (CLAM). The CAM obtains category priors using an external object detector and transfers them to word embeddings. These category priors are then used to initialize the Object Query, enhancing the representation ability of features. The effectiveness of CATN is evaluated on two popular HOI benchmarks, HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, and achieves a new state-of-the-art result. The contributions of this work include demonstrating the improvement achievable by utilizing category-aware semantic information in transformer-based HOI models and presenting the CATN with its CAM and CLAM modules. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
