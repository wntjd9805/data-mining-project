Cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CD-WSOD) is a valuable technique in practical detection applications, where training and testing data may belong to different domains. To address the domain shift, previous approaches have explored supervised, unsupervised, and weakly supervised methods. However, existing weakly supervised approaches often focus on aligning only certain components of the detection pipeline, ignoring the importance of aligning all components. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Holistic and Hierarchical Feature Alignment (H2FA) R-CNN for CD-WSOD. H2FA R-CNN incorporates holistic detection components, including the backbone, region proposal network (RPN), and detection head, and organizes multiple alignments in a hierarchical sequence aligned with the detection pipeline. The hierarchical sequence consists of two image-level alignments for the backbone and two instance-level alignments for the RPN and detection head.Specifically, the image-level alignments for the backbone include both class-agnostic and class-wise alignments. The class-agnostic alignment uses adversarial domain classifiers to align the domains without categorizing each image, while the class-wise alignment learns class-wise prototypes to align the features of each class. For the RPN and detection head, we enforce an instance-level foreground alignment and an instance-level class-wise alignment, respectively. To enable instance-level alignments without instance-level annotations, we introduce a novel Instance- and Image-level Recognition (IIR) unit that combines instance-level and image-level recognition functions.We demonstrate the effectiveness of H2FA R-CNN through comprehensive experiments, showing significant improvements in cross-domain object detection performance compared to previous approaches. Additionally, H2FA R-CNN exhibits strong noise robustness. Our contributions include the proposal of the H2FA R-CNN method, the development of the IIR unit, and the evaluation of both on popular benchmarks.
