Diffusion-based generative models (DPMs) and score-based models have recently shown great success in synthesizing realistic and high-resolution images. These models have numerous applications in various domains, such as image manipulation, translation, and super-resolution. While recent studies have improved DPMs, there is a question of whether they can serve as effective representation learners.One approach to learning a representation is through an autoencoder. However, existing DPM-based autoencoders lack high-level semantics and other desirable properties. On the other hand, GAN inversion techniques can extract a representation with rich semantics but struggle with faithful reconstruction of the input image.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a diffusion-based autoencoder that leverages DPMs for decodable representation learning. The key idea is to learn both high-level semantics and low-level stochastic variations by using a learnable encoder and a DPM-based decoder. Specifically, this approach utilizes a conditional variant of the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) as the decoder, with the latent code separated into semantic and stochastic subcodes.This framework has two implications. Firstly, by conditioning DDIM on the semantic information, denoising becomes easier and faster. Secondly, it produces a representation that is linear, semantically meaningful, and decodable, which is a novel property for DPMs. This allows harnessing DPMs for challenging tasks such as interpolation and attribute manipulation on real images.Despite being an autoencoder, this framework can also be used for unconditional generation by fitting another DPM to the semantic subcode distribution. Furthermore, it enables few-shot conditional generation without the need for additional contrastive learning.Overall, this diffusion-based autoencoder provides a meaningful and decodable representation by combining powerful DPMs with an encoder-decoder architecture. It offers advantages in terms of denoising, interpolation, and attribute manipulation, making it a valuable tool for various image generation tasks.
