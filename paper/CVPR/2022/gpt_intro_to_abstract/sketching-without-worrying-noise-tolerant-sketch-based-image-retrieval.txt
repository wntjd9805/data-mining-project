Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) has emerged as a practical method for image research, complementing text-based retrieval. While SBIR was initially developed for category-level retrieval, it has recently shifted towards fine-grained retrieval to capture the detailed characteristics of sketches. However, many users are hesitant to sketch due to a fear of not being able to produce quality sketches. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing module for fine-grained SBIR that enables users to sketch without fear. We address the issue of noisy strokes by selecting an optimal subset of strokes that contribute to effective retrieval. We propose a stroke subset selector that quantifies the importance of each stroke and determines whether to include it in the query stroke subset. The stroke subset selector is trained using reinforcement learning and a pre-trained SBIR model. We also demonstrate that the proposed method has secondary applications in guiding users to produce suitable sketches, speeding up on-the-fly retrieval, and augmenting sketch data for other tasks. Our contributions include tackling the fear-to-sketch problem, formulating it as a stroke subset selection problem, proposing a RL-based framework for stroke subset selection, and showcasing the versatility of the pre-trained subset selector for various sketch applications.
