Text recognition is widely used in various applications, but most existing methods assume that the characters in the testing set are covered by the training set, making it challenging to recognize unseen characters without retraining the model. This paper introduces the concept of open-set text recognition, where novel characters can emerge over time due to language evolution. The paper discusses the limitations of current visual-matching-based text recognition methods and how they can be affected by contextual information captured from the training set. To address this challenge, the authors propose a character-context decoupling framework that separates character visual information from contextual information. This framework includes a Detached Temporal Attention module to model temporal information and isolate it from visual features, as well as a Decoupled Context Anchor mechanism to separate linguistic information from character visual information. The proposed framework aims to reduce the confounding effect of training-set contextual information on visual features, making it more robust to contextual information bias in open-set scenarios. The paper presents the main contributions of the research, including the proposed framework and its modules, and highlights the improvements in word-level open-set text recognition achieved through reduced impact of contextual information on visual representation of novel characters.
