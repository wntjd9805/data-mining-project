Data augmentation is a critical technique used to enhance the generalization of machine learning models. AutoAugment has been introduced as a method to automatically search for efficient augmentation strategies. However, the significant computational cost associated with searching for these strategies has been a major drawback. Recent studies have demonstrated methods that dramatically reduce the search costs of AutoAugment, making it more feasible for practical use. Online data augmentation optimization frameworks have been developed to simplify the search process and reduce computational costs. These frameworks update augmentation policies and target networks alternately. Adversarial data augmentation is a commonly used strategy within these frameworks, but it can lead to the generation of meaningless or unrecognizable images. In order to address this issue, the TeachAugment method is proposed. TeachAugment transforms the data so that they are adversarial for the target model but recognizable for the teacher model. This approach avoids the collapse of inherent image meanings that occurs with traditional adversarial data augmentation methods. TeachAugment also eliminates the need for prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning, making it more practical for practitioners. Additionally, the proposed method utilizes neural networks to represent geometric and color augmentations, reducing the number of functions in the search space. This simplification allows for easier convergence and better performance without the need for extensive parameter tuning. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the TeachAugment method, which leverages teacher knowledge for more informative adversarial augmentation, and the use of neural networks for data augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TeachAugment compared to other methods in various tasks, such as classification and semantic segmentation, without the need for hyperparameter adjustment.
