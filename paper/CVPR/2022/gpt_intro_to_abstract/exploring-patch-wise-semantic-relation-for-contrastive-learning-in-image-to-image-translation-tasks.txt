Image-to-image translation tasks aim to convert images from a source domain to a target domain while preserving the contents and adopting the appearance of the target domain. The use of cycle consistency loss, which ensures the consistency between the input and reconstructed images through an inverse mapping, has been prevalent in various frameworks. However, this approach requires additional generators and discriminators to learn the inverse mapping. Some studies have also pointed out that the cycle-consistency constraint may lead to distortion due to its overly restrictive nature. To address these challenges, one-sided image translation methods have been proposed to enhance the correspondence between input and output images without relying on cycle consistency. Recently, inspired by the success of contrastive learning, a method called CUT introduced contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information between corresponding locations in input and output images. Another method, NEGCUT, utilized contrastive learning with hard negative samples generated by a negative generator. However, this approach requires additional training for the negative generator, which may be unstable. F-LSeSim used patch-wise similarity maps for contrastive learning but did not consider the semantic relation between patches. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning method that utilizes heterogeneous semantics within an image. We introduce a consistency regularization on the similarity relation, preserving the spatial semantic relation during image translation tasks. We capture the patch-wise semantic relationship using distributional similarity, preventing the generation of artifacts that violate semantic relations. Additionally, we propose a hard negative mining strategy based on spatially varying semantic relations between image patches, which improves performance by focusing on "hard" negative samples. Our experimental results on single- and multi-modal translation tasks and GAN compression demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively utilizing semantic relationships.
