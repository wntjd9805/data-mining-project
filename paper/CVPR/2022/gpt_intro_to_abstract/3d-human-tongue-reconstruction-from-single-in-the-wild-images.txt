Recent advancements in computer vision have led to significant progress in 3D face reconstruction from single "in-the-wild" images. However, the existing methods disregard the statistical variations in the oral cavity, including the absence of a tongue template mesh. This neglect hinders the realism and accuracy of the reconstructed avatars, limits the expression mimicking capabilities, and affects speech animation and face recognition tasks. The absence of publicly available tongue datasets and the computational challenges arising from the highly deformable nature of the tongue have contributed to the omission of tongue component in current state-of-the-art methods.To address the lack of tongue data, we have collected a large and diverse dataset of textured 3D tongue point-clouds. Using this dataset, we have developed a pipeline consisting of a tongue point-cloud autoencoder, a tongue image encoder, and a shape decoder. The autoencoder derives useful 3D features from the raw collected data, and the encoder optimizes these features. The shape decoder translates the encoder outputs into the parameter space of the Universal Head Model (UHM), which is rigged/modified to model various tongue shapes/expressions. The pipeline is trained in an end-to-end fashion to ensure the UHM's output tongue expression closely matches the ground-truth 3D tongue point-cloud of the 2D tongue image.However, due to the absence of ground-truth 3D tongue data corresponding to "in-the-wild" 2D tongue images, the performance of the pipeline is sub-optimal under such conditions. Therefore, we propose a novel conditional GAN framework that generates accurate 3D tongue point-clouds based on the image encoder outputs. With this framework, we create new image/point-cloud pairs of "in-the-wild" tongue data and re-train the pipeline. The inclusion of these new data significantly improves the quality of the tongue reconstructions.In summary, our contributions include the release of a dataset of 1,800 raw tongue scans, a complete pipeline capable of reconstructing the 3D face and tongue from a single image, and a novel GAN framework for robust reconstruction of 3D tongues from "in-the-wild" images. Our work addresses the lack of tongue data, provides valuable resources to the community, and enhances the realism and accuracy of 3D face reconstructions.
