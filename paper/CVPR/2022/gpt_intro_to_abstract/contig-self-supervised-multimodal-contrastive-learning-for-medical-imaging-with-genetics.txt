Medical imaging is crucial for patient healthcare, aiding in disease prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the high costs of expert annotations often hinder the implementation of machine learning algorithms in clinical settings. Large-scale biobank studies, such as the UK Biobank, have started aggregating multimodal data on human health. These studies include various imaging modalities and genetic data, providing a rich array of measurements. While imaging data carries valuable information about organ structures, the human genome contains essential genetic differences that influence physical and disease traits. Integrating these distinct yet complementary data modalities is challenging but can offer a more holistic understanding of health traits. Current computational and statistical challenges exist in understanding the relationships between genetic and imaging modalities. Self-supervised (unsupervised) representation learning offers a viable solution when unlabeled data is abundant and labels are scarce. These methods can learn semantic representations without expert annotations and integrate multiple data modalities efficiently. However, little work has been done to apply self-supervised learning in the medical domain, specifically in combined imaging and genetic modalities. This paper proposes a self-supervised method called ContIG that learns from unlabeled multimodal datasets of medical images and genetic data. ContIG aligns these modalities in the representation space using a contrastive loss, enabling the learning of semantic representations in the same model end-to-end. The method accommodates multiple genetic modalities even when the available modalities vary across individuals. Furthermore, gradient-based explainability algorithms are adapted to understand the learned cross-modal correspondences, and their relevance is cross-referenced with biomedical literature. This framework presents how inexpensive self-supervised solutions can be exploited in large corpora of medical images and genetic data from biobanks.
