Image synthesis through generative adversarial networks (GANs) with differential privacy (DP) can provide a solution for data release while preserving privacy. However, training GANs can be challenging, especially when introducing noise in differential private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) for differential privacy. This limits the resolution of generated images and hinders practical applications of image synthesis. In this paper, we address the difficulty of generating high-resolution images from differentially private GANs (DPGANs). We identify four main problems with the naive combination of DP and GANs: training inefficiency, difficulty in tuning hyperparameters, large noise magnitude, and damage to visual quality from the direction of noisy gradients. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that uses a sampling method on the training data guided by an energy-based network. We introduce the Differentially Private Generative Energy-guided Network (DPGEN) architecture for high-resolution image synthesis. DPGEN utilizes a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method and an energy-guided network to generate perceptually realistic images with high utility. We demonstrate that DPGEN achieves Îµ-differential privacy and can synthesize high-resolution images up to 128x128 with improved sample quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
