The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the advancements made in object detection tasks by convolutional neural networks. It compares the accuracy-performance balance of two-stage/multi-stage detectors and one-stage detectors. Recent research aims to simplify training and inference pipelines by eliminating predeﬁned anchors, implementing one-one label assignment strategies, and utilizing only one output feature map.Although NMS-free methods have shown reasonable accuracies, they still have some drawbacks in terms of accuracies, performance, training time, and design flexibility. NMS or Soft-NMS is still commonly used to remove redundant bounding boxes in inference stage, especially when real-time inference is not required or in autonomous vehicle systems.The paper highlights the limitations of NMS-based methods and proposes a clustering framework called CP-Cluster to replace them. CP-Cluster is designed to achieve better accuracy and parallelizability. It constructs a graph set from candidate boxes, propagates positive and negative messages among them to enhance true positives and penalize redundant boxes, and iteratively tunes their conﬁdence values until convergence. The message propagation is restricted within neighboring candidate boxes for full parallelism.The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: 1) Introducing CP-Cluster as a fully parallelizable clustering framework that outperforms NMS-based methods in accuracies.2) Applying CP-Cluster to various mainstream detectors without retraining, resulting in general improvement for all detectors.3) Demonstrating the capability of CP-Cluster to explicitly improve NMS-free detectors, specifically CenterNet.To the best of the authors' knowledge, CP-Cluster is the only bounding box clustering method that achieves general improvements on most mainstream object detectors in a plug and play manner. Its full parallelism also makes it suitable for real-time tasks.
