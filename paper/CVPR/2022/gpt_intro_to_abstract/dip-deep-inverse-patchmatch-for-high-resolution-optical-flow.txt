This paper introduces a Patchmatch-based framework for optical flow prediction, aiming to reduce memory usage while maintaining high accuracy. The framework includes two key modules: propagation and local search. The Patchmatch algorithm is used to compute correlations, reducing memory overhead. Additionally, the paper proposes an inverse propagation method to reduce calculation time. Experimental results on datasets show that the proposed method achieves a good trade-off between performance and memory usage and has a strong cross-dataset generalization. The contributions of this work include the design of an efficient framework, the introduction of an inverse propagation module, and the demonstration of good trade-off and generalization. Previous works on optical flow prediction and Patchmatch-based methods are also discussed in the paper.
