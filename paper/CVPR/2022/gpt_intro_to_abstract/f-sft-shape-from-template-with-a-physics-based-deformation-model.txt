Reconstructing deformable surfaces in 3D from monocular RGB videos is a complex task. Existing methods, such as non-rigid structure from motion (NRSfM) and shape-from-template (SfT), have limitations in capturing fine local surface deformations. This paper introduces φ-SfT, a new analysis-by-synthesis SfT method that improves the accuracy of monocular non-rigid 3D reconstruction. φ-SfT explicitly models the physical fold formation process and utilizes a differentiable renderer and physics simulator for optimization. Unlike previous methods, φ-SfT defines reprojection error densely per pixel, enabling fine-scale local folds and leveraging texture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that φ-SfT outperforms related methods and supports a wide spectrum of deformations. The paper also presents a new dataset for evaluation and releases the source code to facilitate future research.
