This paper focuses on the development of effective algorithms for compressing lidar data, which is commonly used in applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality. The raw lidar data can be represented as a range image, where each pixel corresponds to a laser shot. The authors propose a data-driven algorithm called RIDDLE (Range Image Deep DeLta Encoding) that uses predictive neural networks to compress range images. This algorithm predicts the attributes of the next pixel in a raster-scanning order and then encodes the residuals between the predicted values and the original values to achieve lossless compression. The authors represent local image patches as 3D point clouds in spherical coordinates to reflect the non-uniform ray angles of each shot. They evaluate the proposed method on large-scale datasets and compare it to existing compression methods, demonstrating significant improvements in bitrate reduction and distortion reduction. Additionally, they evaluate the impact of compression on downstream perception tasks such as 3D object detection and provide extensive analysis to validate their approach.
