Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with modern object detectors achieving promising results on balanced datasets such as PASCAL VOC and COCO. However, in real-world scenarios, datasets often follow a Zipfian distribution, where a large number of tail categories have few samples. Current detectors struggle with severe performance degradation on these tail classes, making long-tail object detection a challenging problem. Previous literature has focused on data re-sampling and loss re-weighting to address this issue, but these methods have limitations and lack intuition and geometric interpretability. In this paper, we propose a Category-Aware Angular Margin Loss (C2AM Loss) that adapts the decision boundary based on the weight norm distribution. C2AM Loss introduces a category-aware margin that is proportional to the ratio of the classifier's weight norm, allowing for adaptive pushing of the decision boundary towards categories with smaller weight norms. This approach maintains the classifier bias in a proper magnitude without generating an ill-conditioned decision boundary. Experimental results on the LVIS dataset demonstrate the superiority of C2AM Loss, with improvements in average precision for both rare and common categories. Our work contributes to understanding the impact of imbalanced weight norm distribution on decision boundary and presents an effective method for long-tail object detection.
