This paper introduces the concept and challenges of online action detection in videos. Online action detection differs from traditional action detection as it involves real-time monitoring and reporting of action instances in streaming videos. The paper discusses the importance of modeling long-term dependencies in action detection algorithms and explores the value of incorporating category-level modeling for improved accuracy. The proposed solution is a unified framework called Colar, which utilizes an exemplar-consultation mechanism to address these challenges. The mechanism transforms frames and their exemplary frames into key and value spaces, measures similarity, and aggregates information efficiently. The framework includes a dynamic branch for modeling long-term dependencies within a video segment and a static branch for category-level modeling. The paper also addresses the computational efficiency of online action detection, utilizing a spatio-temporal network to perform end-to-end detection. Experimental results show that Colar achieves superior performance and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets. Overall, this paper contributes to the field by introducing category-level modeling, proposing an efficient exemplar-consultation mechanism, and demonstrating improved performance in online action detection.
