Dense 3D reconstruction from images is a fundamental task in computer vision, with previous research focusing on RGB-only image reconstruction. However, with the increasing availability of depth sensors in commercial devices, researchers have developed reconstruction algorithms that utilize depth maps. One common representation used in these methods is the Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) Volume, which discretizes scene geometry at a pre-defined resolution. However, this representation loses fine details at sub-voxel scale and is vulnerable to noisy depth measurements. In contrast, neural implicit representations have shown promise in novel view synthesis and shape modeling. These representations are deep neural networks that map continuous 3D coordinates to scene properties. They can preserve fine details and can be trained as generative models. While TSDF volume-based methods have shown real-time capability, how to incrementally integrate new depth measurements using neural implicit representations remains an open question. In this paper, we propose Bi-level Neural Volume Fusion (BNV-Fusion) for high-quality and online 3D reconstruction. BNV-Fusion combines a local-level fusion and a global-level fusion to incrementally integrate depth measurements into a global neural volume. The local-level fusion maps new depth maps to latent codes and fuses them into the global neural volume using weighted averaging. However, this local-level fusion is susceptible to depth outliers and may not lead to correct geometry. To address this, we optimize the global volume using neural rendering, penalizing the discrepancies between the signed distance functions (SDFs) extracted from the global volume and those of the depth measurements. Through extensive experiments, we validate that BNV-Fusion improves existing approaches significantly and is generalizable to arbitrary scenes. Our contributions include proposing BNV-Fusion as a state-of-the-art dense 3D reconstruction pipeline, designing a novel bi-level fusion algorithm for updating the neural volume, and conducting evaluations on various indoor environments to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of BNV-Fusion.
