This paper introduces the concept of Single Instance annotated Object Detection (SIOD) as a new task in object detection. Compared to existing tasks such as Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD), Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), and Sparsely annotated object detection (SAOD), SIOD aims to reduce inter-task and inter-image discrepancies by annotating only one instance for each category in an image. The paper proposes a framework called Dual-Mining (DMiner) for SIOD, which consists of a Similarity-based Pseudo Label Generating module (SPLG) and a Pixel-level Group Contrastive Learning module (PGCL). SPLG mines latent instances based on feature similarity, while PGCL self-mines positive pairs for group contrastive learning. The paper also introduces a conÔ¨Ådence constraint to coco style evaluation metrics to filter out detections with low confidence. Experimental results show that SIOD and the proposed DMiner framework achieve significant improvements compared to baseline methods.
