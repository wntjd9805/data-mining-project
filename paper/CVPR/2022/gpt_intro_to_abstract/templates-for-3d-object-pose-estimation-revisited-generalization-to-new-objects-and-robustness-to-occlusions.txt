3D object pose estimation has made significant advancements in terms of accuracy and robustness over the past decade, particularly in handling partial occlusions. The need for large amounts of real annotated training images has also been alleviated through techniques like domain transfer, domain randomization, and self-supervised learning using synthetic images. Despite these improvements, image-based 3D object pose estimation has yet to be widely adopted in industries such as robotics and augmented reality. Industrial applications require the ability to handle arbitrary, previously-unseen objects without retraining, relying solely on their CAD models.While some previous works have tackled the challenge of pose estimation for new objects, most of them impose additional constraints such as assuming known categories, similarity to training objects, or prominent corners. In contrast, template-based approaches offer the promise of generalizing to arbitrary new objects by learning an image embedding that matches input images with templates generated from CAD models. However, the effectiveness of these approaches with new objects has only been demonstrated anecdotally, and they struggle in challenging scenarios with occlusions.This paper introduces a template-based approach that utilizes the 2D structure of images to address the limitations of previous methods. Local features are learned from a small set of training objects, enabling reliable matching of real images with synthetic templates. By focusing on local features, the background can be discarded, solving the limitations of global representations. Using the template's mask to remove the background in the real image without recomputing the input image representation for each template enhances efficiency.The use of local features also leads to more accurate pose estimation, as pooling operations that remove critical pose information are not employed. Additionally, the proposed method is robust to partial occlusions. A measure for evaluating image similarity, considering the object's mask in the template and potential occlusions in the query image, is introduced.Experiments conducted on the LINEMOD, Occlusion-LINEMOD, and T-LESS datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to previous template-based methods when dealing with new objects. The contributions of this paper include a failure-case analysis of previous methods, a method for predicting pose without training on new objects or imposing similarity constraints, and a method that remains robust to occlusions even in the challenging scenario of new and occluded objects.
