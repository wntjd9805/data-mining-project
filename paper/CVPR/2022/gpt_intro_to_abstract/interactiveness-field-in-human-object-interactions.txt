Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in areas such as robot manipulation and surveillance event detection. HOI detection involves localizing humans and objects in an image and pairing them correctly, and classifying the interactions into various verbs. The conventional two-stage approach, which involves object detection followed by exhaustive pairing and verb classification, is inefficient as it detects and pairs many unnecessary instances. Alternatively, one-stage methods replace object detection with H-O pair detection and achieve the same goal with fewer pairs, but still require a large number of output pairs per image. This paper addresses the bottleneck of H-O pairing by proposing an interactiveness field model based on the bimodal distribution of interactiveness in HOI images. The proposed model filters out non-interactive pairs, leading to improved HOI detection performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
