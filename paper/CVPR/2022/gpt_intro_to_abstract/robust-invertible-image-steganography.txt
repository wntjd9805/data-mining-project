Steganography, the practice of hiding messages in a covert manner, is widely studied in computer science. Image steganography, specifically, involves hiding secrets within host images. This process ensures that only receivers with specific knowledge can extract the hidden information from the resulting container image. To achieve effective steganography, the hidden information must be invisible to steganalysis techniques that analyze color, frequency, and other features. The goal is to embed as much confidential data as possible into the host image, which is referred to as payload capacity. Various steganography schemes have been proposed, but they often fail to strike a balance between imperceptibility and high payload capacity. Traditional methods achieve low capacities due to limitations on the number of significant bits or indistinguishable parts where the secret data is embedded. Recent learning-based steganography methods have attempted to maximize secret capacity, but they often treat the pre-processing, concealing, and revealing as separate modules, resulting in less efficient approaches.To address these limitations, this paper introduces the concept of invertible neural networks (INN) and a framework called Robust Invertible Image Steganography (RIIS). INN has shown promise in solving low-level inverse problems, making it a natural fit for the image steganography task. RIIS leverages INN to embed multiple secret images into a single container image, significantly increasing steganography capacity. However, prior image steganography techniques focused on capacity and invisibility, neglecting robustness and vulnerability to noise and compression interference. RIIS aims to improve robustness by handling diverse distortions, such as Gaussian noise, Poisson noise, and JPEG compression. It achieves this by simultaneously modeling the distribution of the container image and disposable high-frequency information, preserving valuable secret information implicitly. Additionally, RIIS incorporates a distortion-guided modulation (DGM) that adapts the model's parameters to different distortion levels. This makes RIIS a general and controllable framework for various types and levels of distortion, requiring only one set of parameters.Experimental results demonstrate that RIIS outperforms previous methods in terms of robustness, imperceptibility, and capacity in both lossless and distorted environments. It has shown promising results in real-world steganography, face-swap detection, and grayscale colorization applications.
