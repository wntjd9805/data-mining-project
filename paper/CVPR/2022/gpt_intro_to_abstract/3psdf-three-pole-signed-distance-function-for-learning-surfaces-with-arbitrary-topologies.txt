This paper introduces a new learnable implicit representation called Three-Pole Signed Distance Function (3PSDF) for effective 3D learning. The paper discusses various 3D representations that have been studied over the years, including mesh, voxels, point cloud, and neural implicit functions (NIF). Classic NIF approaches rely on the signed distance function (SDF) and can only model closed surfaces. Recent advances using the unsigned distance function (UDF) allow learning of open surfaces from point clouds, but the instantiation into an explicit mesh is cumbersome and prone to artifacts. The paper addresses these limitations by presenting 3PSDF, which can represent highly intricate geometries containing both closed and open surfaces with high fidelity. 3PSDF makes the learning an easy-to-train classification task and is compatible with efficient iso-surface extraction techniques. The paper evaluates 3PSDF on various tasks and demonstrates that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of 3PSDF, a simple and effective learning paradigm for 3PSDF, and achieving state-of-the-art results on three applications across a wide range of benchmarks.
