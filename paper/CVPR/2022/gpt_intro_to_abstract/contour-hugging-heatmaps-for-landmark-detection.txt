Automatic landmark detection from images is a crucial task in various applications, such as monitoring a driver's vital signs and medical imaging on body parts like the knee, spine, and lungs. Although deep learning methods have shown impressive localization results in landmark detection, they still produce some erroneous detections during testing. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this problem by formulating landmark detection as a classification task over all pixels in an image. By utilizing this approach, more expressive and interpretable heatmaps can be obtained, which can be calibrated and analyzed using a novel statistic called Expected Radial Error (ERE). The ERE statistic correlates well with true localization error and can be used to identify potentially erroneous predictions. This paper aims to provide an effective solution for accurate landmark detection, particularly in safety-critical clinical workflows where human expert supervision may be lacking.
