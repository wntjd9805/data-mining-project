Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in image denoising, primarily driven by supervised learning-based approaches. However, the lack of large-scale datasets with high-quality ground truth hinders the application of these approaches in real-world scenarios. Unsupervised learning-based methods have been proposed to learn image denoising without ground truth, but existing methods either show poor performance or work under impractical settings. This paper focuses on two research directions in unsupervised denoising: learning from single noisy images and learning from paired noisy images. While learning from single noisy images is convenient, it often exhibits poor performance due to the ill-posed nature of the task. On the other hand, learning from paired noisy images improves denoising performance but is challenging to capture in practice, especially for moving scenes. Another approach involves adding synthetic noise to already noisy images to create training pairs for denoising networks, but this results in a distribution mismatch that limits denoising performance on actual noisy images. This paper proposes an unsupervised denoising method that only requires single noisy images and a noise model for training a denoising neural network. The noise model can be easily obtained in raw image denoising and can be of various types. The proposed method includes an iterative data refinement (IDR) scheme that gradually reduces the data bias between the created noisier-noisy dataset and the ideal noisy-clean dataset, resulting in better denoising models. A fast version of IDR is also introduced to reduce training time. The proposed method is evaluated on a high-quality raw image denoising dataset, and it outperforms existing unsupervised methods on various noise types and levels. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of IDR, a self-supervised image denoising scheme that operates under a practical setting, the development of a fast approximation version of IDR, the collection of a high-quality raw image denoising dataset, and the demonstration of the method's effectiveness and superiority over existing methods.
