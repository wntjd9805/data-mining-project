Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to predict the bounding boxes and classes of objects in an image. Traditional detectors were mainly based on convolutional neural networks, but the recent introduction of Transformers into object detection has led to significant advancements. In particular, the DEtection TRansformer (DETR) model uses learnable queries and bipartite graph matching for set-based box prediction, eliminating the need for hand-designed anchors and non-maximum suppression. However, DETR suffers from slow training convergence compared to previous detectors, requiring 500 epochs of training on the COCO detection dataset.Several works have attempted to address the slow convergence issue by improving the model architecture or refining the query design. However, few have focused on the bipartite graph matching component, which can introduce instability in the training process. In this paper, the authors propose a novel training method that introduces a query denoising task to stabilize bipartite graph matching. The denoising task involves using ground truth bounding boxes as noised queries and feeding them into Transformer decoders along with learnable anchor queries. A reconstruction loss is employed for the denoising task, while the existing bipartite matching loss is retained for the anchor queries. This denoising training approach allows DETR to learn bounding box prediction more quickly and alleviate the instability of discrete bipartite matching.The proposed method is evaluated using the DAB-DETR model, which formulates decoder queries as 4D anchor boxes. Experimental results demonstrate that the denoising training approach significantly accelerates training convergence and achieves the best result among all detection algorithms in a 12-epoch setting. Furthermore, the method shows a remarkable improvement over the baseline DAB-DETR model and can be easily integrated into other DETR-like methods.This work is the first to introduce the denoising principle into detection models and provides a deeper understanding of DETR training. The authors also conduct ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of different components of their model. Overall, the proposed method offers a promising solution to the slow convergence issue in DETR and contributes to the advancement of object detection in computer vision.
