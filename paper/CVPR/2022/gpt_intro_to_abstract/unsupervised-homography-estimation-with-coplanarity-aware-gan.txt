Homography estimation is a crucial task in computer vision with diverse applications such as image/video stitching, camera calibration, HDR imaging, and SLAM. Traditional methods follow a pipeline of feature extraction, correspondence matching, and solving direct linear transform, but they often struggle with textureless or blurry images due to a lack of discriminative keypoints. In recent years, unsupervised learning methods have gained popularity in homography estimation by directly predicting the homography using neural networks without relying on keypoints. However, when multiple planes are present in the scene, optimizing over the entire image leads to compromised results, as the predicted homography is averaged across all planes and not accurate on the dominant plane. Existing methods that attempt to address this issue by removing large foregrounds or predicting masks lack explicit guidance and fail to handle plane-induced parallax. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised approach called Homo-GAN to enable homography estimators to focus on the dominant plane. We propose a coplanarity-aware Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that uses a generator to predict soft masks of aligned regions, and a discriminator to check if the masked features are coplanar. By imposing additional coplanarity and area penalties on the aligned regions of the mask, we aim to highlight the dominant plane and guide the training of the homography estimator. Additionally, we design a multi-scale transformer network that predicts the homography in a coarse-to-fine fashion using feature pyramids. Compared to CNN-based alternatives, transformers establish local correspondences more naturally, improving homography estimation. Our contributions include: 1. Introducing a coplanarity-aware GAN to address plane-induced parallax in homography estimation without ground truth. 2. Designing a coarse-to-fine homography estimation transformer with self-attention encoders for capturing local correspondences and class-attention decoders for summarizing global information. 3. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised homography estimation, outperforming previous methods by 22% on matching error.
