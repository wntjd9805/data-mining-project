Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for graph-structured data modeling in various domains. In this paper, the focus is on the node classification task in graphs, where the goal is to learn structure-aware node representations by incorporating contextual information from the neighborhood. This is typically achieved using a pipeline consisting of aggregation, combination, and prediction steps. However, this approach can be computationally expensive for large-scale graphs. To address this issue, the paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) alternative that utilizes a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) as a node encoder and maximizes the mutual information between node and neighborhood representations. This approach effectively distills useful contextual information from the surrounding environment. The proposed method, called Node-to-Neighborhood (N2N), encourages graph smoothing based on a quantifiable smoothness metric. The paper also introduces a Topology-Aware Positive Sampling (TAPS) strategy to improve the efficiency and scalability of the N2N network. Experimental results on six graph-based node classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, which achieves competitive performance while being significantly faster than existing methods.
