Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention and have been successfully applied in various domains, including image and video generation, text-to-image synthesis, and equipment condition monitoring. To improve the quality of generated samples, various GAN architectures and regularization techniques have been proposed. GANs can be seen as a two-player game, where the generator produces data samples and the discriminator classifies them as real or generated. These players are trained alternately to maximize their utilities until convergence at a pure Nash Equilibrium (NE).However, existing algorithms often fail to reliably reach a pure NE as it may not exist, leading to unstable training in GANs. Hence, a mixed NE is considered a more suitable solution concept. Several recent works have proposed mixture architectures with multiple generators and discriminators that consider mixed NE, but guaranteeing convergence to a mixed NE remains a challenge. Mirror-GAN has proposed provably convergent proximal methods to compute the mixed NE by sampling over the strategy space, but this sampling approach may not be efficient as the mixed NE may have a sparse set of strategies.In this paper, we introduce a Double Oracle Framework for Generative Adversarial Networks (DO-GAN), inspired by the successful application of the Double Oracle algorithm in large-scale games. We treat the generator and discriminator as players, obtaining their best responses from oracles and incorporating their utilities into a meta-matrix. We propose a linear program to compute the probability distributions of players' pure strategies (meta-strategies) for their respective oracles. This linear program efficiently computes an exact mixed NE of the meta-matrix game.To address scalability issues, we propose two solutions: a pruning method to reduce the support set of best response strategies and continual learning to retain previous knowledge in a multi-task learning setup. We evaluate DO-GAN variants with different GAN architectures using synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation metrics such as the inception score and FID score.Overall, this work introduces a novel framework for GAN training based on the Double Oracle algorithm, providing a robust solution for computing mixed NE and addressing scalability challenges. The proposed approach shows promising results, indicating its potential for improving the performance of GANs in various applications.
