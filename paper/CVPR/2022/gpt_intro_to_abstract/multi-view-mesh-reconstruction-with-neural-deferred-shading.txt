The reconstruction of 3D objects from multiple images has been a long-standing problem in computer vision. Traditionally, this problem has been approached by matching pixels between images using photo-consistency constraints or learned features. However, analysis-by-synthesis, a technique based on the rendering operation, has emerged as a promising direction for reconstructing scenes with complex illumination, materials, and geometry. This technique optimizes the parameters of a virtual scene so that its rendered appearance matches the input camera images. While previous methods have relied on prior information, such as light and material models, or neural networks to model the rendering operation, these approaches have limitations in terms of generalization and runtime efficiency. In this paper, we propose a fast analysis-by-synthesis method called Neural Deferred Shading (NDS), which combines triangle meshes and neural rendering. Inspired by real-time graphics techniques, our rendering pipeline implements deferred shading, where a triangle mesh is first rasterized, and the pixels are then processed by a neural shader that models the interaction of geometry, material, and light. The differentiability of the rendering pipeline allows us to optimize the neural shader and the surface mesh using gradient descent. This combination of an explicit geometry representation and a neural shader enables fast convergence and maintains the generality of the modeled appearance. Additionally, our method can be easily integrated with existing reconstruction and graphics pipelines due to its support for triangle meshes.Our contributions include: (1) a fast analysis-by-synthesis pipeline that handles arbitrary illumination and materials using triangle meshes and neural shading, (2) a runtime decomposition of our method compared to a state-of-the-art neural approach, and (3) an analysis of the neural shader and the influence of its parameters. With these contributions, our method offers a practical solution for reconstructing 3D objects from multiple images with complex illumination and materials.
