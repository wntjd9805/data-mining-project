Few-shot classification is a challenging task that involves training classifier models to distinguish previously unseen classes with very limited labeled examples. Meta-learning or learning to learn has emerged as a practical solution, where knowledge obtained from a large meta-training set is transferred to the few-shot regime of novel classes. Among the various approaches, metric-based methods have gained significant attention and achieved state-of-the-art performance. These methods learn representations using deep networks and measure similarity between query images and support images through probability distributions.However, existing methods mainly focus on modeling marginal distributions or linear relations between features, neglecting the joint distributions and non-linear relations. Furthermore, some methods relying on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) for measuring dependency suffer from high computational cost. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a deep Brownian Distance Covariance (DeepBDC) method for few-shot classification. The DeepBDC metric, defined as the Euclidean distance between the joint characteristic function and the product of the marginals, can effectively quantify the dependency between random variables. Unlike covariance matrices, DeepBDC can handle non-linear relations and fully characterize independence. It can be seamlessly integrated into deep networks as a modular pooling layer, enabling efficient computation of similarity between images. The core of DeepBDC is highly modular and can be applied to different methodologies of few-shot image classification. Two instantiations of DeepBDC, namely Meta DeepBDC and STL DeepBDC, are presented based on meta-learning and transfer learning frameworks, respectively. Experimental results on six few-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of both instantiations, setting new state-of-the-art results.In conclusion, this paper introduces the deep Brownian Distance Covariance (DeepBDC) method into the field of few-shot classification, addressing the limitations of existing methods in modeling joint distributions and non-linear relations. The proposed DeepBDC metric achieves superior performance and sets new state-of-the-art results in various few-shot classification tasks. The modular nature of DeepBDC enables its flexible integration into different methodologies for improved few-shot image classification.
