This paper introduces a novel approach for reconstructing and tracking liquids in 3D using minimal information. The proposed technique relies on knowledge of the collision environment, gravity direction, and 2D surface detections. Unlike previous approaches that use heuristics or end-to-end models, this method can directly reconstruct liquids without any prior training data. The contributions of this work include a novel optimization problem for reconstructing liquids with a particle representation that considers liquid constraints, seeding the optimization with dynamics prediction, and a branching strategy to dynamically adjust the number of particles in the reconstructed liquid. The paper also discusses related work on liquid detection and simulation registration. Additionally, the authors provide new liquid datasets for further research in this under-explored area.
