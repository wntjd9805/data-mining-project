Humans make decisions using dual systems of thinking, as described by Kahneman's cognitive theory. These systems, known as Glance and Gaze, work together to understand scenes. Inspired by this, we propose a collaborative framework for Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR), a task that involves comprehensively understanding scenes. GSR extends Situation Recognition (SR) by grounding involved entities with bounding boxes. The pipeline of SR and GSR involves predicting a verb (Glance) and estimating nouns for each role associated with the verb (Gaze). Verb prediction is challenging, and existing methods only allow Glance to assist Gaze. To address this limitation, we introduce a collaborative framework, called CoFormer, that enables Glance and Gaze to interact and complement each other. CoFormer consists of Glance and Gaze transformers, which predict the verb and estimate nouns and their groundings, respectively. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the SWiG dataset and demonstrates the effectiveness of the CoFormer framework through extensive experiments and in-depth analyses.
