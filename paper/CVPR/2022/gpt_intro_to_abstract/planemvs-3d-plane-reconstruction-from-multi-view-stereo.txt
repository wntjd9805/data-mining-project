3D planar structure reconstruction from RGB images is a challenging problem in computer vision. Traditional methods rely on assumptions and may not be robust in real-world cases. Recent methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) show improvements but still lack accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach using a multi-view-stereo (MVS) framework with CNNs to reconstruct 3D planes. Unlike single-view methods, MVS methods can resolve scale ambiguity and achieve superior performance. However, MVS methods struggle with texture-less areas and lack smoothness in depth maps. The proposed approach combines the strengths of plane detection and plane MVS branches to address these limitations. A slanted plane sweeping strategy is used to learn plane parameters without ambiguity, and a soft-pooling strategy associates the two branches. Learned uncertainties and a balanced loss objective optimize the multi-task learning system. The proposed approach outperforms single-view methods and state-of-the-art learning-based MVS approaches in terms of accuracy and smoothness. This is the first work to reconstruct planar structures in an end-to-end MVS framework, leveraging multi-view geometry for improved results.
