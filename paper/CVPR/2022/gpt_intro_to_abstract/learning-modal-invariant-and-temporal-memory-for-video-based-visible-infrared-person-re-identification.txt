This paper focuses on the challenging task of cross-modal person re-identification (Re-ID) in video surveillance systems. Re-ID involves matching probe pedestrian images with gallery sets, but the non-overlapping views in surveillance cameras result in significant changes in body postures, illumination, and backgrounds. Deep learning techniques have greatly enhanced Re-ID performance, but most existing methods heavily rely on RGB images, making them ineffective in low lighting conditions. However, surveillance cameras often switch to infrared (IR) mode in such situations, and IR images are capable of preserving information under invisible lighting. This paper explores the use of RGB-IR based cross-modal Re-ID for achieving person identification in 24-hour surveillance systems. While existing methods primarily focus on single-image based tasks, this paper emphasizes the importance of video-based data, which contains richer visual information. The paper introduces a video-based cross-modal Re-ID approach that exploits the temporal information in tracklets, resulting in more robust and accurate identification models. A novel method called Modal-Invariant and Temporal-Memory Learning (MITML) is proposed to remove modal-variance and exploit motion information for improved performance. Experimental results on a constructed RGB-IR database validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This work makes several contributions, including the construction of a video-based RGB-IR database, the demonstration of the significance of video-based cross-modal Re-ID, and the proposal of the MITML method for improved performance.
