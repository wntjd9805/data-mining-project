Dental models obtained through intraoral scanning are commonly used in computer-aided dentistry. The use of dental models is crucial in analyzing and evaluating patient-specific dental health and arrangements for orthodontic treatments. However, automatic tooth instance segmentation on dental models is a challenging task that requires dense manual annotations, making it difficult to collect a large enough dataset for training. One of the main challenges is locating each tooth object on different dental models, some of which may have missing, crowded, or misaligned teeth. In this paper, we propose a novel detect-and-segment framework for tooth instance segmentation. We focus on the detection stage, using tooth centroids as a reliable signal for tooth detection. We also introduce a patch-based training strategy to improve segmentation accuracy. To address the issue of irrelevant points in tooth centroid detection, we propose an arch-aware point sampling module that utilizes dental arch information to filter out irrelevant points. This is the first attempt at 3D tooth instance segmentation on dental models with weak annotations. Our proposed framework, named DArch, significantly improves tooth centroid detection accuracy compared to existing methods. Additionally, DArch outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both weakly- and fully-annotated scenarios for tooth instance segmentation.
