Image deblurring is a crucial problem in image processing and computer vision, aiming to restore clear images from blurry images. Blurry images not only impact perceptual quality but also affect the performance of various applications. Hence, image deblurring remains an active area of research. Traditionally, researchers have used blur kernel estimation followed by deconvolution or regularization techniques to address the ill-posed nature of the problem. However, recent advancements in deep learning and access to large-scale data have led to the development of convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods that have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Many of these methods use the U-Net architecture, which consists of an encoder and decoder to handle multi-scale degradation. This paper proposes a new approach, called XYDeblur, to address the complex nature of image blurs. The proposed network includes a single encoder and two decoders, each solving a specific sub-problem of deblurring. One decoder generates a principal residual that contains blurred edges along the horizontal axis, while the other decoder generates the complementary residual along the vertical axis. The network structure is further improved by spatially rotating the convolutional kernels in one decoder and sharing the parameters with the other. This parameter sharing technique not only reduces the number of parameters but also enhances performance by eliminating irrelevant features. Experimental results demonstrate that XYDeblur outperforms U-Net while using the same number of parameters. Additionally, the proposed architecture can be seamlessly integrated into existing U-Net-based networks, leading to improved deblurring performance. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: 1. Introducing a one-encoder-two-decoder architecture in image deblurring, where each decoder provides complementary sub-solutions that are visually orthogonal in the spatial domain. 2. XYDeblur incorporates rotated convolutional kernels, resulting in improved deblurring performance without increasing the model size. 3. The proposed network can be integrated into various U-Net-based networks, leading to enhanced deblurring capabilities.
