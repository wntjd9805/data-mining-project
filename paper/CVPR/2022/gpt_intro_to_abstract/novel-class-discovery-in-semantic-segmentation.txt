Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successful in the field of semantic segmentation but require large amounts of annotated data. To alleviate this cost, various techniques such as semi-supervised learning and unsupervised learning have been proposed. However, these techniques are based on the assumption that the labeled and unlabeled data share the same label space, which may not be the case in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new setting called Novel Class Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (NCDSS), which aims to discover novel classes in semantic segmentation using prior knowledge from labeled data. We propose a basic framework that leverages foreground features and saliency maps to segment novel images. However, this framework has limitations in terms of accuracy and handling multiple novel classes in one image. To address these limitations, we propose the Entropy-based Uncertainty Modeling and Self-training (EUMS) framework, which improves model performance by distilling accurate clustering pseudo-labels and utilizing unclean data through self-training. We evaluate our frameworks on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets and demonstrate their effectiveness in NCDSS.
