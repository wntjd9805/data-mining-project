Semantic segmentation, which assigns semantic labels to each pixel in an image, has found applications in various fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and remote sensing image interpretation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have significantly contributed to the progress of semantic segmentation in fully supervised settings. However, training a fully supervised model requires a large amount of pixel-level annotations, which is an expensive and time-consuming task. In response, researchers have explored weakly supervised approaches that learn from image-level labels, bounding boxes, scribbles, or points. Among these approaches, Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels has gained popularity.Most existing WSSS methods employ Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technology to provide localization cues. CAM-based methods train a classifier and use its learned weights as a general representation of each class, known as the class center. These class centers are then used to correlate with image pixels and generate localization maps. However, CAM tends to focus only on primary regions and may neglect other important cues. The imbalanced activations of CAM result in incomplete localization maps. To address this issue, the paper proposes the Self-supervised Image-specific Prototype Exploration (SIPE) framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation.SIPE consists of two components: Image-specific Prototype Exploration (IPE) and a General-Specific Consistency (GSC) loss. IPE utilizes the inter-pixel semantics to explore spatial structure cues and locate robust seed regions for each class. From these seed regions, image-specific prototypes are extracted, and an Image-Specific CAM (IS-CAM) is generated using prototypical correlation. GSC is introduced to enforce consistency between the general CAM and the IS-CAM, optimizing the feature representation. The SIPE framework is evaluated on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance when only image-level labels are available.The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) The proposal of SIPE, a framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation that learns image-specific knowledge. (2) The development of IPE, which tailors image-specific prototypes through structure-aware seed locating and background-aware prototype modeling, leading to more complete localization maps. (3) The introduction of the GSC loss, which effectively regularizes the original CAM and IS-CAM to empower the feature representation.
