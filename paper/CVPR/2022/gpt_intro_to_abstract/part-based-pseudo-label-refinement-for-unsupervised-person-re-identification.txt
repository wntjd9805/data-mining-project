Person re-identification (re-ID) is the task of identifying a specific person across different camera views or time stamps. While supervised approaches using deep neural networks have shown promising results, they are limited by the need for large amounts of labeled data. Unsupervised methods that learn discriminative features from unlabeled data have gained attention as a potential solution. Previous works in unsupervised re-ID have used pseudo-labels generated through techniques like k-nearest neighbor search or unsupervised clustering. However, the presence of label noise in these pseudo-labels hinders the performance of these methods. To address this issue, previous works have focused on pseudo-label refinement or robust clustering. These methods often involve training multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. Additionally, they mainly consider global features and ignore fine-grained information crucial to person re-ID. In this paper, we propose Part-based Pseudo Label Refinement (PPLR), a novel unsupervised re-ID framework that takes advantage of part features for better representation learning and robustness against label noise. We argue that the complementary relationship between global and part features can be used to refine label noise, but precautions must be taken to exclude irrelevant or incorrect information. To this end, we introduce a cross agreement score based on the similarity between the k-nearest neighbors of global and part features. Based on this score, we present two pseudo-label refinement methods â€“ part-guided label refinement (PGLR) and agreement-aware label smoothing (AALS). PGLR aggregates predictions from part features to refine pseudo-labels of global features, while AALS smooths label distributions to calibrate predictions from part features. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPLR, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in person re-ID.
