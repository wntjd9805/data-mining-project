Tele-wide camera systems in smartphones utilize multiple lenses with different focal lengths to generate a pair of images with different resolutions. This enables various applications such as optical zoom and image quality enhancement. However, correspondence estimation from resolution-asymmetric stereo images is challenging and typically relies on conventional symmetric stereo matching algorithms combined with image upsampling. This approach is vulnerable to artifacts introduced by upsampling, especially for large upsampling scales. While asymmetric stereo matching has been studied under specific contexts, the resolution-asymmetric setting has received less attention. Existing approaches for visually imbalanced stereo matching require ground-truth disparity and explicit degradation information, limiting their applicability in real-world systems.In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach for resolution-asymmetric stereo matching by introducing feature-metric consistency. Instead of relying on photometric consistency assumptions, we leverage the feature space to ensure that pixels recording light rays from the same scene point have the same feature representation. We demonstrate that a stereo matching network trained with a photometric loss can produce degradation-agnostic and matching-specific features for asymmetric pixels. These features enable the formulation of a feature-metric loss that avoids photometric inconsistency. Additionally, we introduce a self-boosting strategy to progressively optimize the feature extractor and enhance feature-metric consistency. We evaluate our method on simulated and real-world resolution-asymmetric stereo datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing solutions. Contributions of this paper include the first unsupervised learning method for resolution-asymmetric stereo correspondence estimation, an effective realization of feature-metric consistency, a self-boosting strategy for progressive loss update, and significant performance improvements on simulated and real-world datasets.
