Inverse rendering is a technique used to reconstruct the shape and appearance of real-world objects from a set of 2D input images. It can enable accessible and high-quality digitization of our world. This problem can be formulated as inverting rendering algorithms used in computer graphics. Recent advancements in graphics have introduced fully differentiable Monte Carlo path tracing methods, which optimize geometry and BRDFs represented as triangle meshes and material textures. However, optimizing meshes can be challenging due to difficulties in modifying their topology and maintaining regularity. On the other hand, neural representations for shape and radiance fields have shown success in tasks like view synthesis and shape reconstruction, but they cannot be directly used for applications like relighting or material editing.In this paper, we propose a pipeline called IRON (Inverse Rendering by Optimizing Neural scene components) to address the inverse rendering problem. Our objective is to combine the flexibility and compactness of neural representations with the convenience of meshes with material textures in downstream applications. The IRON pipeline performs an inverse rendering optimization starting from multi-view images captured by co-locating a flashlight with a moving camera. The optimized 3D content can be exported in mesh and material texture formats for traditional graphics renderers and AR/VR applications.At the core of IRON are four compact neural networks representing neural signed distance fields (SDF) and neural materials, which are optimized using a hybrid optimization scheme. This scheme includes a volumetric radiance field optimization to recover object topology, followed by physics-based surface rendering to refine geometric details and disentangle materials and lighting. We demonstrate that IRON achieves superior inverse rendering quality compared to baseline methods targeting photometric images.Additionally, we propose a new edge sampling algorithm specifically designed for neural SDF representations, which improves reconstruction quality around edges. Consideration of occlusion boundaries is essential in inverse rendering with meshes, and our algorithm generates unbiased gradient estimates to optimize neural SDFs effectively.In summary, the key contributions of this paper are:1. IRON, a neural inverse rendering pipeline for high-quality reconstruction of object shape and spatially varying materials, surpassing existing methods for photometric images.2. A hybrid optimization scheme for neural SDFs and materials, involving volumetric radiance field optimization and edge-aware physics-based surface rendering for improved performance and compatibility with meshes and material textures.3. An edge-aware rendering optimization with a novel edge sampling algorithm that produces unbiased gradient estimates to enhance the optimization of neural SDFs.
