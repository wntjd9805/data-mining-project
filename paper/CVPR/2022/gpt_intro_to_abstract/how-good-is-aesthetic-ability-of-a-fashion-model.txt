This paper introduces the concept of fashion compatibility learning, which involves measuring the compatibility among a set of fashion items. The aesthetic ability of these methods is commonly used for cross-selling by online retailers. However, current evaluation practices focus on retrieval or ranking performance, rather than reflecting the model's aesthetic ability. To address this gap, the authors propose the A100 (Aesthetic 100) evaluation framework, which includes two tests: the LAT (Liberalism Aesthetic Test) and the AAT (Academicism Aesthetic Test). The LAT measures the aesthetic standard of the Bottom-up fashion system, while the AAT measures the aesthetic standard of the Top-down fashion system. The authors also introduce several considerations for designing the evaluation protocol, including completeness, practicality, and reliability. They provide detailed descriptions of the LAT and AAT tests, as well as the scoring methods for each. The paper concludes with an analysis of their evaluation results, demonstrating the reliability and explainability of their new approach. The main contributions of the paper include the evaluation of fashion compatibility based on professional fashion domain knowledge, the introduction of the A100 framework for comprehensive evaluation of aesthetic ability, and the demonstration of the reliability and explainability of their evaluations through experiments.
