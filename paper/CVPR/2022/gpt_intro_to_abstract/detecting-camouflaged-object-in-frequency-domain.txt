Camouflage object detection (COD) plays a crucial role in various visual systems such as polyp segmentation, lung infection segmentation, and recreational art. Traditional methods relying on handcrafted low-level features often fail in complex scenes. Recent advancements using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have significantly improved COD performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that introduces frequency clues beyond the RGB domain to enhance COD. The proposed method utilizes a frequency enhancement module (FEM) with a frequency perceptual loss and a high-order relation module (HOR) to leverage frequency domain information. Experimental results on three widely-used COD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This work is the first to leverage frequency clues for better detection of camouflaged objects, providing a new direction for COD research.
