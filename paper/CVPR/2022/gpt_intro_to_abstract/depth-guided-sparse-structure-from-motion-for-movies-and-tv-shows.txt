Estimating camera motion and 3-D scene geometry in movies and TV shows is a common task in video production. However, the amount of camera movement is often constrained in order to create an engaging viewing experience. This leads to insufficient parallax, which poses a challenge for existing approaches to 3-D scene reconstruction.Conventional SfM pipelines typically use heuristics to handle data with small parallax, but these heuristics can fail when there is no image pair with sufficient parallax. Learning-based approaches are more effective in handling data with small parallax, but they do not incorporate geometric-consistency constraints and their results are not as accurate. Furthermore, the generalizability of these approaches relies heavily on the scale of labeled data used for training.Hybrid approaches have been proposed to address these challenges, but they heavily depend on the quality of optical flow and require heavy compute and memory resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid approach that combines the strengths of geometry-based SfM and learning-based SfM.Our approach leverages a pretrained deep network to obtain single-frame depth-priors, which are used to improve the initialization and incremental reconstruction steps of the geometry-based SfM pipeline. Instead of using epipolar geometry, we directly utilize monocular depth to recover the initial camera pose and point cloud. During the incremental reconstruction step, we propose a depth-prior regularized objective function to accurately register and triangulate new images and points.We evaluate our approach using a new dataset (StudioSfM) containing shots from TV episodes. We demonstrate that our approach offers significantly more accurate camera poses and scene geometry in studio-produced content with small parallax, without causing degradation on standard SfM datasets with large parallax. Our approach maintains the generalizability and scalability of standard SfM pipelines by relying on well-engineered implementations.In conclusion, our hybrid approach combines the strengths of geometry-based SfM and learning-based SfM to effectively handle data with insufficient parallax. Our approach improves the accuracy of camera motion and 3-D scene reconstruction in studio-produced content, while maintaining the generalizability and scalability of standard SfM pipelines.
