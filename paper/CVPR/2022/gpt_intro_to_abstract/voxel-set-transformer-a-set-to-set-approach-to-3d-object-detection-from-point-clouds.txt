Object detection from 3D point cloud has gained significant attention due to its relevance in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. However, 3D point cloud data poses challenges for applying convolutional neural network (CNN) layers due to its sparse and uneven distribution. To address this, existing approaches transform the point cloud into a discrete representation before applying CNN models. Another approach involves modeling the point cloud in continuous space for multi-scale feature extraction through grouping and aggregation steps. Additionally, transformer-based models have emerged as a viable option for processing point cloud data, as the self-attention in transformers is invariant to permutation and cardinality. However, the quadratic computation complexity of self-attention limits its applicability to long sequence point clouds. Prior works have attempted to overcome this limitation by balancing the token number in each cluster, but this results in unstable detection results and redundant computations. Voxel Transformer performs self-attention on a discrete voxel grid, allowing for efficient computation but limiting long-range dependencies. While some solutions address self-attention on a reduced set of seed points, they are not suitable for sparse and large-scale outdoor scenes. To address these limitations, the authors propose a voxel-based set attention (VSA) module that partitions the scene into non-overlapping 3D voxels and computes voxel indices to determine attentive regions. Inspired by induced set transformers, trainable latent codes are assigned to each voxel, enabling efficient information compression. The proposed Voxel Set Transformer (VoxSeT) leverages VSA modules for 3D object detection and achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the VSA module can be seamlessly incorporated into point-based detectors, offering advantages over existing set abstraction modules. This work introduces a novel approach to processing 3D point cloud data, providing an alternative to current convolutional and point-based backbones for improved feature learning.
