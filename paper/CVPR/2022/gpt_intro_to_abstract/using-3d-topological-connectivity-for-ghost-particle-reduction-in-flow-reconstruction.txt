Volumetric velocimetry techniques allow for the analysis of complex fluid flow fields by providing complete spatio-temporal information of the flow. These techniques typically involve using two synchronized cameras to track the positions of tracer particles as they move with the flow. Two common approaches for volumetric velocimetry are 3D Particle Tracking Velocimetry (3D-PTV) and Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (Tomo-PIV). However, both methods often result in the reconstruction of "ghost particles", which are particles that cannot be determined as real or artifacts of the reconstruction process. This issue arises due to factors such as tracer density and challenges in handling large velocity differences.One less common variant of 3D-PTV is 3D Particle Streak Velocimetry (3D-PSV), where the cameras' exposure time is increased to record the pathlines of tracer particles as streaks. This approach retains the tracking information in a single image and allows for the elimination of some reconstruction ambiguities. Additionally, the streaks encode displacement information for both fast and slow-moving particles, making this method suitable for high dynamic velocity range flows.In this paper, we investigate the use of topological information inherent in long-exposure images to reduce the number of ambiguous reconstructions. We first develop a theoretical model that describes how the number of reconstruction ambiguities is reduced when reconstructing linear streaks instead of points. Then, we model the streaks as projections of conic section segments and demonstrate that the probability of ghost streak generation can be further reduced by imposing correspondence constraints. Finally, we propose a new method for establishing multi-view matches among conic section segments while satisfying an endpoint correspondence constraint.We validate our models and reconstruction method using both synthetic data and experimental data. The results show that our approach significantly reduces ghost reconstructions and provides practical advantages for flow reconstruction. This challenges the established preference for point reconstruction and provides theoretical support for the benefits of using topological connectivity in reducing the number of ghost particles in volumetric velocimetry.
