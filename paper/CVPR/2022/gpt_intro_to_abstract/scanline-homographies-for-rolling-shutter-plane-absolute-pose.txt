Many portable devices utilize cameras equipped with a rolling-shutter (RS) mechanism, which offers advantages such as low-power consumption, affordability, and high frame rates. A RS camera exposes and reads out each scanline sequentially during imaging, as opposed to cameras with global-shutter (GS) mechanisms that read out all pixel rows simultaneously. However, RS cameras face challenges when capturing highly dynamic environments or when the camera itself undergoes rapid movements during scanline reading. These challenges include violations of the conventional pinhole camera model used in most vision algorithms and the generation of unintended artifacts such as distortion and blur.Previous research has focused on RS geometry and RS image rectification, primarily employing motion assumptions such as kinematic models, trajectory fitting, pose interpolation, or homography mixtures. In this paper, we address the problem of RS absolute pose estimation, specifically for planar objects. We aim to estimate the poses of all scanlines in a single RS image given a template and RS image rectification. While a closed-form solution exists for this problem using a constant kinematic motion model, solving the problem without motion assumptions poses a non-trivial challenge.Our approach assumes smooth camera motion, derived from the time-coherence nature of RS images. We do not assume any specific type of camera motion, allowing for simple kinematics, complicated dynamics, or even random movements. Additionally, we extend the template class to include GS images obtained from cameras with a principal axis orthogonal to the planar scene. We introduce the concept of scanline homography to address the challenges posed by RS cameras. The set of scanline homographies defines an image warp, offering flexible camera motion in the RS direction while constraining the x-direction to ensure compatibility with the template.Our key contributions include proposing the scanline homography as a novel RS geometric concept and establishing the fundamental homography equation between scanline homographies and plane homographies defined by the template. We estimate scanline homographies using B-Splines along the RS direction, allowing for flexible camera motions through a convex minimization approach. To solve the ambiguous fundamental homography equation and recover scanline poses, we employ an articulated plane homography parameterization and GS homography initialization inspired by motion smoothness. We validate our proposed theory through various experiments, including absolute pose estimation and image rectification.
