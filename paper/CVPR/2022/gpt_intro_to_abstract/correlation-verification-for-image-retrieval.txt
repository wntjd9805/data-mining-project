Image retrieval is a well-known challenge in computer vision, involving the sorting of a database of images based on their similarities to a given query image. Global retrieval and geometric verification are commonly used approaches in this task. Deep learning has also significantly advanced image retrieval, with studies focused on extracting representative and distinctive features. However, geometric verification still plays a crucial role in re-ranking despite its drawbacks. It relies on sparse and thresholded feature correspondence, lacks learnability and differentiability, and requires iterative optimization. Furthermore, it lacks a multi-scale operation component. This study proposes an end-to-end learnable re-ranking network called Correlation Verification Networks (CVNet) to address these issues. The proposed network directly evaluates semantic and geometric relations by leveraging dense feature correlations in a convolutional manner. It employs a 4D convolutional neural network (CNN) with a pyramid structure of deeply stacked 4D convolution layers. The model compresses semantic cues into image similarity and learns diverse geometric matching patterns. It also expands the single-scale feature to a feature pyramid for each image, enabling cross-scale correlations between feature pyramids. This structure allows cross-scale matching with a single inference, eliminating the need for expensive multi-scale inference traditionally used in image retrieval. Curriculum learning using hard negative mining and Hide-and-Seek strategy is employed to handle hard samples. The proposed re-ranking network achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image retrieval benchmarks and significantly reduces feature extraction latency compared to other methods.
