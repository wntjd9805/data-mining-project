Self-supervised image representation learning has gained significant attention in computer vision research, with the aim of learning general and intrinsic image features through pretext tasks. While previous works have primarily focused on 2D images for representation learning, recent studies have started to utilize 3D data, which offers complementary advantages such as easier extraction of geometric structures and occlusion-free information. In this paper, we propose leveraging geometric consistency in 3D data to enhance the learning of image representations. Our intuition is that smooth regions and depth gaps in 3D space can serve as strong cues for semantic understanding. We design a simple yet effective method to learn these geometric consistency priors through clustering 3D data into small segments, termed geometric consistency sets. By incorporating geometric consistency into a contrastive learning framework, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance on various downstream tasks. Our contributions include introducing geometric consistency into self-supervised image representation learning, proposing a multi-view contrastive loss with geometric consistency sets, and achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
