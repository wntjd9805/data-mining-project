Multi-Person Pose Estimation (MPPE) is a crucial task in computer vision that involves detecting and locating keypoints for multiple individuals in an image. MPPE has garnered significant attention due to its applications in human activity understanding, human-object interaction, and human parsing. Current MPPE methods can be categorized into three pipelines: top-down methods, bottom-up methods, and single-stage regression methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel MPPE pipeline called Contextual Instance Decoupling (CID) that aims to effectively separate instances while preserving rich contextual information for accurate keypoint estimation. Unlike existing pipelines, CID decouples each person into a specific instance-aware feature map, which contains all the necessary cues for single-person keypoint localization. This approach offers robustness to detection errors, the ability to explore contextual cues at larger scales, and alleviates the difficulty of long-range location regression.The CID pipeline consists of two main modules: Instance Information Abstraction (IIA) and Global Feature Decoupling (GFD). The IIA module extracts the location and feature information for each person, which is then used by the GFD module to compute spatial and channel attention. This attention is utilized to isolate the corresponding person, and a contrastive loss is introduced to enhance the discriminative power of the instance features. The generated instance-aware feature maps are used to estimate the final heatmaps for keypoint estimation.We evaluate CID on multiple benchmark datasets for multi-person pose estimation, including COCO Keypoint, CrowdPose, and OCHuman. Experimental results demonstrate that CID outperforms recent works following different pipelines, achieving superior performance with high efficiency. For instance, CID achieves 71.3% Average Precision (AP) on CrowdPose, surpassing DEKR, CenterAttention, and JC-SPPE by 5.6%, 3.7%, and 5.3%, respectively. Additionally, CID shows competitive performance on the widely used COCO benchmark, achieving 68.9% AP, outperforming DEKR by 1.6%.To the best of our knowledge, CID is the first attempt at leveraging contextual instance decoupling for MPPE. Compared to previous pipelines, CID offers better robustness to detection errors, alleviates the complexity of keypoint grouping and long distance regression, and encodes more contextual and spatial cues at larger scales. These advantages make CID an effective pipeline for multi-person pose estimation.
