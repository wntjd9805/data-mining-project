Abstract:Camera devices are commonly used to capture photographs in various exposure conditions, leading to images with underexposures or overexposures that often have unsatisfactory visual effects. Existing exposure correction methods, such as model-driven and deep learning-based approaches, mainly focus on addressing either underexposure or overexposure, making them limited in their generalization capability to other exposure conditions. A naive solution is to train separate networks for each exposure condition, but this increases training time and parameter space. Alternatively, training a network with a mixture of data from different exposure conditions can improve its ability for multiple-exposure correction. However, due to the variations in representations between underexposure and overexposure, the network's performance is hampered by difficulties in effectively correcting lightness and color across multiple exposures. Additionally, the network tends to overlook disadvantaged data within mixed datasets, resulting in imbalanced performance across exposures. To address these issues, we propose a framework for improving multiple-exposure correction performance by narrowing the gap between different exposure representations. Our framework includes an Exposure Normalization and Compensation (ENC) module, which comprises an exposure normalization part and a compensation part. The exposure normalization part aligns different exposure features using Instance Normalization and applies a normalization distilling loss to further reduce the exposure effect. However, normalization may cause the loss of image discriminative features, so the compensation part integrates features that were not processed by exposure normalization to preserve completeness of information. To enhance correction for the worst-performing exposure and avoid degradation in performance for other exposures, we keep the normalization ability of the ENC module consistent for all exposures while applying a parameter regularization strategy for fine-tuning the other parts of the network.Our proposed ENC module can also be extended to address other image degradations captured by different mobile phones, highlighting the generalization capability of our method. The main contributions of our work include proposing a framework for multiple exposure correction by narrowing the gap between exposure representations, developing the ENC module for exposure normalization and compensation, employing a parameter regularization strategy for balanced improvement across exposures, and demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization superiority of our framework on various datasets and image enhancement tasks.
