3D geometry representation is a crucial component in various computer vision tasks such as 3D model understanding, reconstruction, and matching. Medical image applications, such as organ segmentation, medical image reconstruction, shape abnormality detection, and surgical navigation, heavily rely on shape representation. Deep implicit functions (DIFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling 3D objects, providing compact yet expressive representations. However, establishing correspondences between shapes using DIFs is challenging, limiting their application in shape analysis, especially in medical imaging. Several methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but they often neglect preserving the topology of shapes during deformation. This is problematic for applications involving shapes with fixed topologies. In this paper, we propose Neural Diffeomorphic Flow (NDF), a new formulation of DIFs that ensures topology preservation during shape deformation. NDF incorporates an invertible time-varying velocity field based on neural ODEs to enable progressive and time-invertible shape deformation. Our experiments on multiple organ datasets demonstrate that NDF achieves state-of-the-art results in shape reconstruction and registration, with significantly fewer unpleasant faces generated in shape registration.
