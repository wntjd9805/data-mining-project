Single-view monocular depth estimation (SVDE) is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in areas such as autonomous driving, robotics navigation, and augmented reality. Early SVDE methods were limited to specific domains, resulting in poor generalization ability. Recently, efforts have been made to obtain depth data from various sources, including stereo videos and stereo images. However, the depth data obtained from stereo videos is incomplete and cannot be used to recover 3D geometry. Existing general-purpose SVDE methods trained on stereo data produce predictions that are not geometry-preserving. The only method that is both general-purpose and geometry-preserving is LeReS, but it requires significant computation overhead and geometrically complete data for training. In this work, we introduce GP2, an end-to-end training scheme that allows SVDE models to learn correct depth predictions without additional models or geometrically complete data. We show that our training scheme improves depth estimates and point cloud reconstructions compared to existing methods. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that SVDE models can learn to predict geometrically correct depth even when trained mainly on incomplete data. Our contributions include the introduction of GP2, improved depth estimates and point cloud reconstructions, and setting a new state-of-the-art in general-purpose geometry-preserving SVDE. The rest of the paper discusses the relationship between depth data and 3D geometry, existing SVDE approaches, our training scheme, and experimental results.
