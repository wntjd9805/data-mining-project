The problem of semantic matching, which involves finding correspondences between images depicting the same object or scene category, is challenging due to appearance and shape variations, viewpoint changes, and background clutter. Existing datasets with annotated keypoints for matching are limited in their usefulness. Weakly-supervised approaches that leverage image-level class labels have emerged as an attractive alternative. Previous weakly-supervised methods introduce objectives on the predicted dense correspondence volume but provide limited supervision. This paper proposes Probabilistic Warp Consistency, a weakly-supervised learning objective for semantic matching. The objective is derived from a probabilistic mapping representation of predicted correspondences and employs a learnable unmatched state to model occlusion and unmatched regions. The proposed approach achieves improved performance on benchmark datasets for both weakly-supervised and strongly-supervised scenarios.
