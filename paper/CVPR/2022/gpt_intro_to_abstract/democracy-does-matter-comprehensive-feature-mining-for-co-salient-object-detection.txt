Abstract:Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) is a task that aims to identify salient objects that appear in a group of input images. Unlike traditional salient object detection (SOD) which focuses on detecting the most attractive objects, CoSOD seeks to detect salient objects that are common among multiple images. However, CoSOD faces challenges in reducing background interference and detecting co-salient objects with varying appearances. Existing approaches have introduced extra datasets or employed attention mechanisms to address these challenges. However, these methods have limitations in terms of limited coverage of co-salient objects and focusing on incorrect object regions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Democratic Co-salient-Feature-Mining framework (DCFM). Our framework includes a democratic prototype generation module (DPG) that generates response maps to capture shared attributes, a self-contrastive learning module (SCL) to suppress noisy background, and a democratic feature enhancement module (DFE) to strengthen co-salient features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, particularly on challenging real-world datasets.
