Object detection is a crucial problem in computer vision, but existing deep learning models for object detection are often complex and computationally expensive. This limits their deployment in resource-constrained settings with strict latency requirements, such as real-time detection on mobile or embedded devices. To address this challenge, recent works have focused on designing lightweight models for mobile object detection, particularly for video object detection. However, these models still have limitations in terms of accuracy and latency. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch object detection framework (MBODF) that allows for the selection of different execution branches at inference time, resulting in improved detection accuracy and latency. We introduce a scheduler that considers different branches, their accuracy, latency, and input content to select the optimal one for a given situation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by constructing an MBODF using existing object detectors and object trackers. Our method achieves high accuracy with a wide range of latency requirements on a mobile GPU device. We also explore the importance of content-aware decision-making in branch selection and propose a content-aware scheduler that adapts to video content. Our method shows promising results and outperforms previous approaches. Overall, our contributions include highlighting the adaptiveness of modern detectors, designing an MBODF, and demonstrating the benefits of content-aware object detection.
