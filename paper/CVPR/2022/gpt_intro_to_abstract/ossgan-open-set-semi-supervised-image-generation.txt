This paper introduces a novel task called open-set semi-supervised image generation, which aims to reduce the reliance on labeled data in training conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). The traditional approach of semi-supervised image generation assumes that unlabeled data contains only closed-set samples, but in reality, the majority of unlabeled data consists of open-set samples, resulting in poor cGAN performance. To address this issue, the authors propose a new model, called Open-Set Semi-supervised GAN (OSSGAN), that incorporates entropy regularization into the training process to quantify the confidence of predictions and enable the use of unlabeled data, including open-set samples. Experimental results show that OSSGAN effectively utilizes unlabeled data, achieving better performance compared to supervised and semi-supervised baselines. The proposed method is also robust to miscellaneous data and demonstrates superior generation quality. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the open-set semi-supervised image generation task, the design of OSSGAN with entropy regularization, and the demonstration of superior performance in generating high-quality images with limited labeled data.
