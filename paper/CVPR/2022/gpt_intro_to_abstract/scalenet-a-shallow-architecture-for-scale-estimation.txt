Establishing correspondences is a crucial step in various 3D pipelines, with implications for tasks like camera pose estimation, autonomous driving, and 3D reconstructions. However, searching for correspondences between images remains a challenging task, and existing solutions are not yet fully effective. Recent advancements in the field have resulted in new approaches for handling correspondences, such as improved keypoint detectors, dense geometric matchers, and geometric verification techniques. These methods have demonstrated the ability to handle extreme cases where previous pipelines failed, enhancing the robustness of downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of handling scale changes between images, which has long been a challenge in computer vision. Scale robustness and estimation are crucial parameters to consider, and several strategies have been proposed, including multi-scale pyramids and methods that aim to be invariant to scales through the learning process. However, these approaches come with increased complexity and decreased discriminative power. We propose a novel approach called ScaleNet, which estimates and corrects the scale factor between a pair of images before the correspondence search. ScaleNet utilizes a scale predictor network inspired by dense geometric methods and conditioned local feature extractors. By formulating the scale regression problem as the estimation of a probability distribution in logarithmic space, we address the non-linear nature of scale changes. Our contributions include a scale-aware matching system based on ScaleNet, a strategy to measure and label the scale factor, and a learning scheme that handles the non-linear nature of scale changes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various tasks and datasets.
