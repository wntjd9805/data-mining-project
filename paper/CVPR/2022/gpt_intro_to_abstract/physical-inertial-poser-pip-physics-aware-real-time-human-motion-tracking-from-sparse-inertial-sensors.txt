Capturing human motion is a complex problem with numerous applications in computer vision, graphics, movie production, gaming, AR, and VR. The challenge lies in accurately capturing the articulated structure and fast movements of the human body. Previous works have proposed image-based approaches that analyze image data to recover actor motion. However, these methods are sensitive to occlusions, lighting conditions, and appearance variations, and are limited to a static camera setup.In recent years, researchers have explored alternative sensing devices such as inertial measurement units (IMUs). While production-ready solutions exist, they rely on dense sets of IMUs, which are difficult to wear and can restrict the actor's movement. Sparse IMU-based methods struggle with physical correctness, pose disambiguation, temporal delays, and limited accuracy.To address these limitations, we propose the Physical Inertial Poser (PIP) method for real-time motion capture, joint torque estimation, and ground reaction force estimation using only six IMUs. PIP consists of two stages: learning-based motion estimation and physics-based motion optimization. In the estimation stage, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used to regress human pose, joint velocities, and foot-ground contact probabilities from the IMU inputs. To overcome pose ambiguity, a learning-based RNN state initialization strategy is proposed. In the optimization stage, we recover physically correct motion, joint torques, and ground reaction forces using a torque-controlled floating-base simulated character model. Unlike previous methods, we introduce a dual PD controller that combines global holistic control of the character's pose by applying PD rules to joint positions and rotations. This improves translation accuracy and physical plausibility of the motion.Our contributions include the development of PIP as the first physics-aware real-time approach for motion capture with only six IMUs, a learning-based RNN state initialization scheme to improve disambiguation, and a dual PD controller for enhanced motion tracking accuracy and physical plausibility. Experimental results demonstrate that PIP outperforms previous sparse IMU-based methods in terms of tracking accuracy, physical plausibility, and pose disambiguation.
