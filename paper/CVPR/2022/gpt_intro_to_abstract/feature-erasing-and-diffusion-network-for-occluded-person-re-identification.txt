Person Re-Identification (ReID) aims at retrieving the same pedestrians captured by different cameras with different viewpoints, lighting conditions, and locations. Traditional ReID methods assume that a holistic body of each pedestrian is available for feature extraction, but in real-world scenarios, pedestrians are often disturbed by non-pedestrian occlusions (NPO) and non-target pedestrians (NTP). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Feature Erasing and Diffusion Network (FED) for occluded person ReID. FED consists of three components: NPO augmentation strategy, occlusion erasing module (OEM), and feature diffusion module (FDM). The NPO augmentation strategy generates object occluded data by pasting cropped patches, and the OEM uses occlusion masks to erase the occluded features and generate occlusion scores. The FDM simulates multi-pedestrian images and diffuses the characteristics of NTP to the original features, improving the model's perception ability towards target pedestrians (TP). Experimental results on occluded and holistic ReID datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FED method, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
