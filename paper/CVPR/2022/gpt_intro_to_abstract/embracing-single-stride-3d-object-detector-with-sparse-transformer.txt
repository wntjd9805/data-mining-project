LiDAR-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving has made significant progress by adopting techniques from image-based object detection. However, there are intrinsic differences between 2D and 3D spaces, particularly in terms of object scales. While 2D object detectors handle objects with varied scales using multi-scale features, 3D object detectors face the challenge of detecting tiny objects due to their small relative sizes. This paper explores the design of a single-stride architecture with no downsampling operators for 3D object detectors. The authors propose a Single-stride Sparse Transformer (SST) that overcomes the issues of computation cost and reduced receptive field. The SST utilizes a local attention mechanism to handle sparse data and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the single stride architecture in detecting tiny objects such as pedestrians. This work highlights the importance of considering network stride as a design factor for LiDAR-based 3D detectors.
