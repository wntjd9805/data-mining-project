Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have revolutionized image generation, with StyleGAN being a popular choice for creating near photorealistic images. However, generating high-quality and high-resolution images for classes with complex variations remains a challenge, especially in the case of full-body human generation. Existing methods that break the target image into tiles and sequentially train a GAN to produce them are limited when the coupling between object parts is nonlocal or difficult to statistically model. Alternatively, training a single GAN at full resolution requires expensive data collection and training tasks and is susceptible to variations in object configuration and poses.In this paper, we propose InsetGAN as a solution to the above challenges. Our approach combines a global context generator, which provides the overall structure, with specialized part generators that focus on different regions of interest. The specialized results are then pasted as insets onto the canvas to generate the final output. This approach has several advantages: the canvas GAN can be trained on medium-quality data, providing global coordination for the specialized parts; the specialized parts can be trained on part-specific data, achieving consistent alignment more easily; and different canvas/part GANs can be trained at different resolutions, lowering data requirements. We address the coordination challenges between the canvas and part GANs to prevent seam artifacts at the inset boundaries. This is particularly challenging when boundary conditions are complex and the inset boundaries are unknown. We propose a joint optimization framework that seeks latent codes in both the canvas and part GANs, ensuring a coherent result without any seams. We focus on human body generation, with the faces generated by a face-specific GAN.We evaluate InsetGAN on a custom dataset and compare it with alternative approaches. The quality of the results is assessed through quantitative metrics and user studies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating seamless compositions across face insets and providing diverse solutions across face insertion boundaries.Our contributions include proposing a multi-GAN optimization framework that collaboratively optimizes latent codes to create coherent and seam-free compositions. We showcase the framework in the challenging task of full-body human generation and present the first feasible pipeline to generate high-resolution human images unconditionally.
