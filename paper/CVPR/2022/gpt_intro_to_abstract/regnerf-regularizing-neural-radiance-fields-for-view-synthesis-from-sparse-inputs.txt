Coordinate-based neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), have gained popularity in 3D vision for tasks like novel view synthesis. While NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance with dense scene coverage, it degrades significantly with sparse inputs. Previous works have proposed conditional models that require expensive pre-training on large-scale datasets, limiting their scalability and generalization. Another approach is to optimize network weights from scratch for each scene and introduce regularization, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we propose RegNeRF, a novel method for regularizing NeRF models for sparse input scenarios. Our contributions include a patch-based regularizer for depth maps rendered from unobserved viewpoints, a normalizing flow model to regularize colors at unseen viewpoints, and an annealing strategy for sampling points along the ray. These contributions improve scene geometry, avoid color shifts, and prevent early training divergence. Overall, RegNeRF enables realistic novel view synthesis from sparse inputs, addressing important challenges in various real-world applications.
