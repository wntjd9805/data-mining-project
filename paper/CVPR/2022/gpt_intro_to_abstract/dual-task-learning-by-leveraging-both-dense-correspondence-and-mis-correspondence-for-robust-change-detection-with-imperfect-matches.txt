Robust scene change detection (SCD) is crucial in various domains like visual surveillance, mobile robotics, and autonomous vehicles. SCD aims to identify changes in the current scene compared to previous scenes. However, factors like view variation, illumination change, dynamic objects, weather, and camera jitter make the task challenging. Current approaches assume perfect matches between scenes, which is rare in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose Simultaneous Scene Flow Estimation and Change Detection (SimSaC), a neural network that performs both tasks concurrently. SimSaC leverages dense correspondence (scene flow) and mis-correspondence (change) through dual-task learning, achieving robust change detection even with imperfect matches. We also present a training scheme using random geometric transformations and cut-paste methods to generate pseudo labels without additional annotations. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation protocol that considers imperfect matches and provide a benchmark dataset. Our contributions include problem formulation, the SimSaC architecture, a robust training scheme, an evaluation dataset, and open sourcing the code, pretrained parameters, and benchmark dataset.
