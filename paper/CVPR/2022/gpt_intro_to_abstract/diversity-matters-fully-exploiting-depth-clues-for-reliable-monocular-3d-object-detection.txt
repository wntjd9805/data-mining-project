This paper introduces a depth solving system for improving monocular 3D object detection. Accurate detection of 3D objects is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Many existing algorithms rely on expensive LiDAR sensors or require precise calibration, limiting their economic feasibility. The proposed system generates diverse depth estimations by leveraging various attribute combinations, addressing the ill-posed nature of depth prediction from monocular images. The importance of diversity is demonstrated through comparisons, showing significant reduction in mean absolute error. To select reliable depth estimations and integrate them, a strategy based on uncertainty removal is devised. Additionally, a new scheme called 3D geometry confidence is proposed to model conditional 3D confidence. The resulting Monocular 3D Detector with Diverse Depth Estimations (MonoDDE) outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy, ranking first and second in two classes and surpassing the current best method by 20.96% relatively on the Moderate level of the Car class in KITTI dataset. The contributions of this work include the development of a depth solving system, a strategy for dealing with collapsed assumptions and outlier removal, and a new scheme for modeling 3D confidence.
