Shape modeling plays a crucial role in medical image analysis, and there have been various techniques used for surface representation. Deep implicit surfaces have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional methods in computer vision, but they have been less explored in biomedical imaging due to specific challenges. Biomedical datasets lack large annotated training data for shape models, resulting in lower quality models. Additionally, spatial resolution is often variable within a single dataset, and labeling errors and organ boundary limitations further complicate the analysis. To address these issues, the paper proposes ImplicitAtlas, a data-efficient implicit shape model for medical imaging. The model utilizes a continuous occupancy grid based on discrete grid exemplars, which is a common representation in biomedical imaging. ImplicitAtlas learns multiple templates that can undergo non-rigid deformations, making it robust to limited training data and labeling noise. The paper introduces a convolutional implicit function to extract multi-scale features, improving the data efficiency further. Extensive experiments on liver, hippocampus, and pancreas datasets demonstrate that ImplicitAtlas outperforms current implicit representation-based methods, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios. The paper also showcases potential applications such as shape completion and keypoint labeling. Despite the increasing popularity of implicit representations in deep learning-based 3D computer vision, they have not been widely adopted in medical image analysis. The scarcity of implicit methods in this domain can be attributed to the challenges posed by biomedical image processing. The paper highlights the use of probabilistic atlases and templates in shape modeling to address these challenges. While probabilistic atlases have been integrated into convolutional neural networks, they require pre-computed atlases that are manually annotated and registered. On the other hand, templates in conjunction with implicit surfaces have mainly been developed on large training datasets, lacking data efficiency. The paper argues for the benefit of learning multiple implicit templates and emphasizes the effectiveness of ImplicitAtlas in overcoming the difficulties presented by biomedical datasets.
