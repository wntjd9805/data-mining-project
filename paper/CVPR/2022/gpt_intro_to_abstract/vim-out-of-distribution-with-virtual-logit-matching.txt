Most deep image classification models are trained in a closed-world setting, which leads to the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue when deployed in production and facing inputs from the open world. OOD detection aims to determine whether an input belongs to the training distribution. It is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving, medical analysis, and industrial inspection. Existing OOD detection methods mainly derive scores from the probability, logit, or feature. However, their performances are limited by relying on a single source of information. In this paper, we propose a novel OOD detection method called Virtual-logit Matching (ViM), which utilizes information from both features and logits. ViM constructs a virtual OOD class based on the features and existing logits, and computes the softmax probability of this class as the OOD score. Experimental results show that ViM outperforms baseline methods on multiple OOD datasets, achieving an average AUROC of 90.91% on the BiT model. Additionally, we curate a new OOD dataset called OpenImage-O for ImageNet-1K, which is diverse and contains complex scenes. We believe that ViM and OpenImage-O will contribute to the advancement of large-scale OOD detection research.
