This paper focuses on the task of scene editing, specifically the editing of illumination for inserted objects in order to achieve scene illumination harmonization. The goal is to seamlessly integrate inserted objects into a scene by adjusting their illumination to match the overall lighting conditions. The research was supervised by Chengjiang Long and Chunxia Xiao, with the corresponding author being designated as â€ . Figure 1 illustrates the process of illumination editing for an inserted object in a single image, showing the foreground object image with its original illumination condition and the desired output after illumination editing. The paper will further explore the techniques and algorithms used to accomplish this task.
