Perception of 3D scenes is crucial for various applications in computer science such as autonomous navigation and robotics. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown exceptional performance in processing 3D point clouds, enabling tasks like shape classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, understanding the logic behind DNN decisions and their limitations remains challenging. Previous research has highlighted the vulnerability of point cloud DNNs to adversarial attacks, emphasizing the need for robustness in security-critical applications.In the domain of image processing, defenses against adversarial attacks have often been later broken by more sophisticated attacks, making evaluating robustness difficult. The concept of certified robustness has emerged as a solution, offering theoretical guarantees independently of the attack's sophistication. Methods for certifying DNNs on images have sparked interest in extending these approaches to point cloud DNNs, certifying against modifications, additions, deletions, and 3D transformations.In this research, we propose 3DeformRS, a certification approach for point cloud DNNs against spatial and deformable transformations. Our approach builds upon the theoretical background of Randomized Smoothing (RS) and extends it to point cloud data. Unlike previous approaches, 3DeformRS considers spatial deformations on any point cloud DNN, providing efficiency and practicality. Our comprehensive empirical study demonstrates that 3DeformRS produces comparable-to-better certificates while requiring significantly less computation time.Our contributions include: (i) the proposal of 3DeformRS, extending RS to certify point cloud transformations, (ii) a comprehensive empirical study assessing the certified robustness of four representative point cloud DNNs on two datasets and against seven spatial deformations, and (iii) a comparison of 3DeformRS with an earlier point cloud certification approach in terms of certification and runtime, showing consistent improvements and scalability.
