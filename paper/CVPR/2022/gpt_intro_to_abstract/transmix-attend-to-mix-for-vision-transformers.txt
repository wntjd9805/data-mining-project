In this paper, we address the optimization difficulties and potential overfitting issues faced by Vision Transformer (ViT) networks in computer vision tasks. We propose a new data augmentation and regularization technique called TransMix, which aims to improve the generalization of ViT-based networks. Unlike existing mixup-based methods like Mixup and CutMix, TransMix considers the varying importance of pixels in an image and selectively mixes only the most descriptive parts while retaining the background image. We argue that not all pixels contribute equally to the label space, and thus linear interpolations of feature vectors may not always lead to accurate target interpolations. By selectively mixing certain regions of the image, TransMix provides a more effective and efficient solution to address this issue. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TransMix through experiments and comparisons with other methods, showing improved performance in terms of accuracy and generalization. This work contributes to the field of computer vision by providing a novel approach to optimize ViT-based networks and enhance their performance in various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
