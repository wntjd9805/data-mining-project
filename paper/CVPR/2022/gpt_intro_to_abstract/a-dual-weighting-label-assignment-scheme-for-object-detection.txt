Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with various applications. In recent years, there has been a significant development in object detectors using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and visual transformers (ViTs). Current state-of-the-art detectors mainly rely on dense detection by predicting class labels and regression offsets using pre-defined anchors. The process of assigning classification and regression labels to anchors is essential in detector training, as it determines the loss weight for each anchor. Existing label assignment methods can be categorized into hard and soft label assignment, with static and dynamic rules for dividing anchors into positive and negative sets. However, current methods often overlook the varying importance of different samples and do not provide fine-grained supervision. To address these limitations, we propose a novel label assignment scheme called dual weighting (DW), which assigns distinct positive and negative weights to each anchor based on different perspectives. The positive weights are determined by the combination of confidence scores and regression scores, reflecting the consistency between the classification head and regression head. The negative weight for each anchor is decomposed into the probability of being a negative sample and its importance conditioned on being negative, allowing for a more nuanced distinction between different anchors. Additionally, we introduce a box refinement operation to improve the accuracy of regression scores. Experimental results on the MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our DW method significantly improves the performance of the FCOS detector, outperforming other label assignment methods.
