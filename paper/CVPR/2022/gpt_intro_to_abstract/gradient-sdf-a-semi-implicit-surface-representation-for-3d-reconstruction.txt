The representation of 3D geometry in computer vision has been extensively studied. When implementing 3D surfaces on a computer, the issue of discretization arises. Different approaches exist based on explicit and implicit representations. Explicit representations involve sampling points on the surface directly, while implicit representations assign scalar values to points in the ambient space to encode the surface. This paper proposes a hybrid representation called Gradient-SDF, which combines a voxel-based implicit signed distance field (SDF) representation with the SDF gradient. The authors introduce Gradient-SDF as an implicit representation with explicit features, demonstrating its accuracy and applicability in depth-based tracking and mapping systems. They also provide a formulation for photometric bundle adjustment using Gradient-SDF. The benefits and practicality of this hybrid representation are evaluated theoretically and experimentally throughout the paper.
