This paper introduces the task of One-Shot image Generation (OSG), which aims to synthesize images of a novel category with only one training example. The goal is to generate new images that are visually similar to the given example while varying attributes such as poses, viewpoints, and actions. Existing methods for one-shot image generation either lack visual quality or semantic information. This paper proposes a novel method called Memory-based Feature Hallucination (MFH) that learns to disentangle image features and utilize a memory structure to preserve key attributes. A pairwise supervision strategy is also introduced to help the model learn class-independent features that can be reused in one-shot generation tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contributions of this work include a novel method for OSG, the integration of disentangled image features and feature hallucination, a pairwise supervision strategy, and the ability to use synthesized images for one-shot classification improvement.
