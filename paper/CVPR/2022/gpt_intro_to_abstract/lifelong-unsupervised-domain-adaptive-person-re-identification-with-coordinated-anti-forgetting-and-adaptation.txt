This paper introduces the concept of Lifelong Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (LUDA) person re-identification (ReID) as a realistic task in the field of computer science. LUDA person ReID aims to enable deployed models to continuously adapt to new environments using unlabeled target data. Unlike existing methods that require annotations in the target domain, LUDA person ReID does not rely on costly labeling processes. The paper proposes an effective scheme called CLUDA-ReID, which coordinates anti-forgetting and adaptation through a coordinated data replay (CDR) method and relational consistency learning (RCL). CDR stores old data using a modified ID-wise reservoir sampling algorithm and uses a meta-based optimization strategy to align the objectives of anti-forgetting and adaptation. RCL promotes knowledge distillation from a historical model to the current model during adaptation. The proposed CLUDA-ReID scheme is evaluated in scenarios with stationary and dynamic target streams, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving LUDA and enhancing unseen-domain generalization. Additionally, a new dataset called MMP-Retrieval is introduced for evaluation purposes. Overall, this paper contributes to the development of practical person ReID models that adapt to changing environments using continuously collected unlabeled data.
