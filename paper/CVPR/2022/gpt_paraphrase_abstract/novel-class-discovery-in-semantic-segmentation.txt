We present a new approach called Novel Class Discovery in Semantic Segmentation (NCDSS) that focuses on segmenting unlabeled images containing new classes based on prior knowledge from a labeled set of disjoint classes. Unlike existing methods that address novel class discovery in image classification, our approach tackles the more challenging task of semantic segmentation. In NCDSS, we not only need to distinguish objects from the background but also handle multiple classes within an image, making use of unlabeled data more difficult. To address this, we utilize the labeled base data and a saliency model to coarsely cluster novel classes for model training in our basic framework. Additionally, we propose the Entropy-based Uncertainty Modeling and Self-training (EUMS) framework to overcome noisy pseudo-labels and further improve model performance on novel classes. Our EUMS framework leverages an entropy ranking technique and dynamic reassignment to distill clean labels, maximizing the use of noisy data through self-supervised learning. We evaluate our approach on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of the basic framework (achieving an average mIoU of 49.81% on PASCAL-5i) and the effectiveness of the EUMS framework (outperforming the basic framework by 9.28% mIoU on PASCAL-5i).
