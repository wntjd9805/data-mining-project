This paper addresses the issue of accurately measuring the quality of sketched images, specifically focusing on sketches of bunnies. The authors acknowledge that a simple sketch may not capture the true beauty of a bunny. They introduce a novel method called Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL) that quantitatively measures sketch quality without relying on human annotations. GACL considers the magnitude of a sketch feature as a quality metric and treats feature magnitude and recognizability learning as dual tasks. The method is lightweight, theoretically sound, and has a geometric interpretation. The authors validate the effectiveness of GACL by comparing its results with human perception through a well-designed human study. They also demonstrate the practical applications of their quantitative quality metric in three sketch-related tasks.
