Developing accurate object detectors that can detect objects outside of the known distribution is an important yet overlooked area of research. One of the main challenges is that models lack supervision signals from unknown data, resulting in overly confident predictions on out-of-distribution objects. To address this issue, we propose a novel object detection framework called Spatial-Temporal Unknown Distillation (STUD). This framework distills unknown objects from videos taken in natural environments and effectively regulates the model's decision boundary. STUD first identifies potential unknown objects in the spatial dimension and then combines these candidates from multiple video frames to create a diverse set of unknown objects near the decision boundary. Additionally, we incorporate an energy-based uncertainty regularization loss, which shapes the uncertainty space between in-distribution objects and the distilled unknown objects. Our proposed STUD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting out-of-distribution objects for object detection tasks. It reduces the false positive rate at 95% recall (FPR95) by more than 10% compared to the previous leading method. The code for implementing STUD is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/stud.
