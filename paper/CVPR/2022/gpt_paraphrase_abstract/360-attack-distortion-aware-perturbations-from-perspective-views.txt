Recent years have seen significant advancements in the application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to 360-degree images. However, it has been shown that DNNs are susceptible to carefully crafted adversarial examples, which can pose serious safety risks in real-world applications that rely on 360-degree images. This paper introduces a new adversarial attack called 360-attack, which specifically targets spherical images. The attack involves transferring adversarial perturbations from perspective-view (PV) images to a final adversarial spherical image. The process begins by representing the target spherical image as a set of planar PV images, on which 2D attacks are performed to generate adversarial PV images. To address the issue of projective distortion between spherical and PV images, a distortion-aware attack is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of distortion on the attack. Additionally, to reconstruct the final adversarial spherical image with high aggressiveness, a novel spherical spectrum method is employed to calculate the spherical saliency map. Furthermore, a saliency-aware fusion strategy is introduced to merge multiple inverse perspective projections for the same position on the spherical image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the 360-attack in disrupting spherical images in a black-box setting. The attack also reveals the presence of adversarial transferability from Z2 to SO(3) groups.
