Equivariance has been a longstanding issue in various fields, such as computer vision and physical modeling. Existing methods have struggled to achieve generality, simplicity, and expressiveness. Some methods are specifically designed for certain types of data, while others are too complex or lack flexible transformations. In this study, we introduce a new and straightforward framework for achieving equivariance in point cloud analysis using a message passing approach (graph neural network). We discover that equivariance can be attained by assigning an orientation to each point, which decouples the relative position of each point from the overall pose of the point cloud. To incorporate this idea, we enhance existing message passing networks with a module that learns orientations for each point. Before aggregating information from neighboring points, the network transforms their coordinates based on the learned orientations of the central point. We provide formal proofs to demonstrate the equivariance of our proposed framework. Through empirical evaluation, we show that our method performs competitively in both point cloud analysis and physical modeling tasks. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/luost26/Equivariant-OrientedMP.
