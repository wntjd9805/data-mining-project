Existing point cloud compression methods have overlooked the importance of local density in representing local details. In response, we propose a new deep point cloud compression method that preserves local density information. Our method follows an auto-encoder approach, with the encoder downsampling the points and learning point-wise features, while the decoder upsamples the points using these features. To encode local geometry and density, we introduce three embeddings: density embedding, local position embedding, and ancestor embedding. During the decoding process, we explicitly predict the upsampling factor, directions, and scales for each point. To address the issue of clustered points in existing methods, we introduce a sub-point convolution layer and an adaptive scale upsampling block. Additionally, our method can compress point-wise attributes, such as normals. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion trade-off, as demonstrated through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations on SemanticKITTI and ShapeNet datasets.
