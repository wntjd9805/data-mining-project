This paper introduces a novel approach called the Generative prior ReciprocAtedInvertible rescaling Network (GRAIN) for generating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) invertible images with a large upscaling factor of 64Ã—. Previous studies have utilized pretrained GAN models to generate high-quality upscaled images but struggled to achieve pixel-accurate results due to the ambiguity of the extreme mapping process. To address this issue, we propose a reciprocated invertible image rescaling process that embeds high-resolution information into the low-resolution image and generative prior, enabling faithful HR reconstruction. The invertible LR features not only contain important HR semantics but also predict scale-specific latent codes, optimizing the use of generative features. Additionally, the enhanced generative prior is reintegrated into the rescaling process to compensate for lost details. This reciprocal mechanism effectively combines the advantages of invertible encoding and generative prior, resulting in a feasible solution for extreme rescaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art upscaling methods. The code for GRAIN is available at https://github.com/cszzx/GRAIN.
