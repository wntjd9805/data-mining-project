Text segmentation is an important task for various text-related applications, but current research mainly focuses on English characters and digits. There is limited work on Chinese characters due to the lack of large-scale and high-quality datasets, which hinders the practical application of text segmentation. Chinese characters are more complex than English, making the problem more challenging. To address this, we introduce the Bi-lingual Text Segmentation (BTS) dataset, which includes diverse and annotated text images from various Chinese scenes. The dataset focuses on Chinese characters but also includes English words and digits. We also propose the Prior Guided Text Segmentation Network (PGTSNet), the first baseline model for bilingual and complex-structured text segmentation. PGTSNet incorporates a text region highlighting module and a text perceptual discriminator to improve segmentation accuracy. It also employs a variation loss to suppress background noise in complex scenes. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the necessity and superiority of the BTS dataset and the effectiveness of PGTSNet compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
