Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a task that involves both object detection and interaction classification. Previous methods for HOI detection have used different subsets of predictions, such as predicting the human-object (HO) relationship first and then the interaction (I), or predicting the human-object interaction (HOI) directly. Recently, transformer-based architectures have been developed for HOI detection, which can predict HOI triplets in an end-to-end manner.To further improve HOI detection using transformers, we propose a new learning strategy called cross-path consistency learning (CPC). CPC leverages augmented decoding paths to enforce consistency among all possible predictions from permuted inference sequences. This approach allows the model to learn consistent representations, leading to improved generalization without increasing the model capacity.Our experiments show that CPC significantly improves HOI detection performance compared to baseline models on the V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets. The code for our method is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/mlvlab/CPChoi.
