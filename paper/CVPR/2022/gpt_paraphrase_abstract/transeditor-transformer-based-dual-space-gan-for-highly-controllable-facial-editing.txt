StyleGAN has advanced the development of controllable facial editing, but the challenge of attribute decoupling remains. Previous attempts to use dual-space GANs for better disentanglement have not produced satisfactory editing results, especially for complex attributes. This study emphasizes the importance of interaction in a dual-space GAN for improved controllability and proposes TransEditor, a novel Transformer-based framework that enhances this interaction. Additionally, a new dual-space editing and inversion strategy is introduced to provide greater editing flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TransEditor outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality and editing capability, making it highly effective for controllable facial editing. The code and models for TransEditor are publicly available at https://github.com/BillyXYB/TransEditor.âˆ— Two authors contributed equally to this work and are listed alphabetically.
