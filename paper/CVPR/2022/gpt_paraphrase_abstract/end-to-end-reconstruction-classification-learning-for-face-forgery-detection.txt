Current face forgery detection methods focus on specific patterns like noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics to identify forgeries. However, this limits their ability to detect forgeries with unknown patterns. In this paper, we propose a new approach to forgery detection that emphasizes the common compact representations of genuine faces. We achieve this by combining reconstruction learning, which enhances the representations to be aware of even unknown forgery patterns, with classification learning, which helps to identify the essential differences between real and fake images. To improve the representations, we use bipartite graphs over the encoder and decoder features in a multi-scale manner, and utilize the reconstruction difference as a guide for identifying forgery traces. This final representation is then fed into the classifier for forgery detection. The reconstruction and classification learning are optimized together in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark datasets show that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.
