Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in data clustering tasks. Deep clustering methods, which combine clustering and feature learning, have shown promise in achieving more accurate results. However, deep subspace clustering methods often suffer from high time and space complexities, limiting their applicability to large-scale and real-time clustering scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deep clustering. Our method involves iteratively refining subspace bases using deep representations, which in turn help improve the representation learning of deep neural networks. Unlike traditional self-expressive models, our method scales linearly with the sample size and can be applied to large datasets and online clustering scenarios. Moreover, our method outperforms competitors in terms of clustering accuracy, as demonstrated through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art clustering approaches on benchmark datasets.
