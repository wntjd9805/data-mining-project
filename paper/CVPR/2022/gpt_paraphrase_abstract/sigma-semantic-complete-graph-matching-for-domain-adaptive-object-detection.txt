Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) aims to train an object detector using labeled data from one domain, and apply it to a new domain without annotations. While current approaches focus on aligning class-conditional distributions by narrowing down class centers, they neglect the within-class variance and domain-mismatched semantics in the training batch, resulting in sub-optimal adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called SemantIc-complete GraphMAtching (SIGMA) for DAOD. SIGMA completes mismatched semantics and reformulates the adaptation process using graph matching. We introduce a Graph-embedded Semantic Completion module (GSC) that generates hallucination graph nodes to complete mis-matched semantics in missing categories. We also construct cross-image graphs to model class-conditional distributions and learn a graph-guided memory bank for improved semantic completion. By representing the source and target data as graphs, we transform the adaptation into a graph matching problem, where we aim to find well-matched node pairs across graphs to reduce the domain gap. This is solved using a novel Bipartite Graph Matching adaptor (BGM). In summary, SIGMA leverages graph nodes to establish semantic-aware node affinity and uses graph edges as quadratic constraints in a structure-aware matching loss, achieving fine-grained adaptation through node-to-node graph matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIGMA outperforms existing approaches significantly. The code for SIGMA is available at https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SIGMA.
