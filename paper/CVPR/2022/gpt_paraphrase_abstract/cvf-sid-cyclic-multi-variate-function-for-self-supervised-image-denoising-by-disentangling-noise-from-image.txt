Progress has been made in image denoising with supervised learning from large datasets. However, obtaining aligned noisy-clean image pairs for each scenario is complex and costly. This makes it difficult to apply supervised denoising networks to real-world noisy inputs. Existing methods that address this issue rely on impractical assumptions and cannot be directly applied in practical situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel self-supervised denoising method called CVF-SID, which consists of a Cyclic multi-Variate Function module and a self-supervised image disentangling framework. The CVF module decomposes the input into multiple variables and cyclically combines the outputs. CVF-SID disentangles the clean image and noise maps from the input using various self-supervised loss terms. Unlike other methods that only consider signal-independent noise models, CVF-SID also handles signal-dependent noise components for real-world applications. It does not rely on any prior assumptions about the noise distribution, making it more generalizable. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CVF-SID achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised image denoising performance and is comparable to other approaches. The code is publicly available.
