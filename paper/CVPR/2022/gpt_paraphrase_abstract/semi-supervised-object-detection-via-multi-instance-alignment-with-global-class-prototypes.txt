Semi-Supervised object detection (SSOD) is a technique that aims to improve the performance of object detectors using large-scale unlabeled images. Current methods for SSOD, which utilize pseudo-labeling, treat labeled and unlabeled data separately without considering their relationship. In order to fully utilize the labeled data, we propose a Multi-instance Alignment model that enhances prediction consistency based on Global Class Prototypes (MA-GCP). The MA-GCP model achieves consistency between pseudo ground-truths and their high-IoU candidates by minimizing the cross-entropy loss of their class distributions, which are computed using global class prototypes. These prototypes are estimated using the entire labeled dataset through the exponential moving average algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of the MA-GCP model by integrating it into a state-of-the-art SSOD framework and conducting experiments on two benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our MA-GCP approach.
