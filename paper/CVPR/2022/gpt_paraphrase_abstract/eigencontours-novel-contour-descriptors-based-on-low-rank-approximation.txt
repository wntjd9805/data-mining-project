This paper introduces a new type of contour descriptors called eigencontours, which are based on low-rank approximation. The process involves creating a contour matrix that includes all object boundaries in a training set. This matrix is then decomposed into eigencontours using the best rank-M approximation. Each object boundary is represented as a linear combination of these eigencontours. The eigencontours are also integrated into an instance segmentation framework. Through experiments, it is shown that the proposed eigencontours are more effective and efficient in representing object boundaries compared to existing descriptors in a low-dimensional space. Additionally, the algorithm performs well on instance segmentation datasets.
