Instance segmentation algorithms have shown excellent performance, but they often struggle with accurately segmenting the boundary areas. This has led to an increased focus on boundary refinement techniques. However, existing approaches either require significant computational resources or are specifically designed for certain backbone models. Contour-based models, on the other hand, are efficient and can be incorporated with any segmentation method, but they tend to generate overly smooth contours and fail in corner areas. In this paper, we propose a new contour-based boundary refinement approach called SharpContour. Our method includes a novel contour evolution process and an Instance-aware Point Classifier. By updating offsets in a discrete manner, our method iteratively deforms the contour, resulting in sharper and more accurate contours compared to existing methods. Importantly, SharpContour is compatible with various existing models and has a low computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that SharpContour achieves competitive performance while maintaining high efficiency.
