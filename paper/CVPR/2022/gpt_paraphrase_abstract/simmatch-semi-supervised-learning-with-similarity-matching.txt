We addressed the challenge of learning with limited labeled data in the fields of computer vision and machine learning. Our paper presents a novel approach called SimMatch, which takes into account both semantic similarity and instance similarity. SimMatch applies consistency regularization to both semantic-level and instance-level data. It encourages different views of the same instance to have consistent class predictions and similar similarity relationships with other instances. Additionally, we introduced a labeled memory buffer to leverage ground truth labels at the instance-level and bridge the gap between semantic and instance similarities. Furthermore, we proposed an unfolding and aggregation operation that enables the transformation of these two similarities in an isomorphic manner. This allows for mutual propagation of semantic and instance pseudo-labels, resulting in the generation of more high-quality and reliable matching targets. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SimMatch significantly improves the performance of semi-supervised learning tasks on various benchmark datasets and settings. Notably, after 400 epochs of training, SimMatch achieves Top-1 Accuracy of 67.2% and 74.4% with 1% and 10% labeled examples on ImageNet, surpassing baseline methods and previous semi-supervised learning frameworks.
