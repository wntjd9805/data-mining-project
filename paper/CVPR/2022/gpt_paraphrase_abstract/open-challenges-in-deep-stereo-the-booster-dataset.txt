We introduce a new stereo dataset for indoor scenes that is characterized by high-resolution and difficult challenges. The dataset contains accurate ground-truth disparities and stands out due to the inclusion of specular and transparent surfaces, which are known to cause problems for current stereo networks. Our dataset is created using a unique deep space-time stereo framework that enables precise labeling with sub-pixel accuracy. It consists of 419 samples obtained from 64 different scenes, all annotated with dense ground-truth disparities. Each sample includes a high-resolution pair (12 Mpx) as well as an unbalanced pair (Left: 12 Mpx, Right: 1.1 Mpx). Additionally, we provide manually annotated material segmentation masks and 15K unlabeled samples. By evaluating state-of-the-art deep networks using our dataset, we demonstrate their limitations in addressing the challenges in stereo and provide insights for future research.
