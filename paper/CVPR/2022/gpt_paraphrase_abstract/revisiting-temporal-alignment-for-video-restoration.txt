Long-range temporal alignment is a crucial but challenging aspect of video restoration tasks. Recent studies have attempted to address this challenge by breaking down the alignment into smaller sub-alignments and handling them progressively. However, this approach can lead to error accumulation due to the propagation mechanism.   To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel iterative alignment module that employs a gradual refinement scheme for sub-alignments. This allows for more accurate motion compensation. Additionally, we introduce a non-parametric re-weighting method to enhance alignment accuracy and temporal consistency. This method evaluates the importance of neighboring frames in a spatial-wise manner for aggregation.   Through these strategies, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various video restoration tasks, including video super-resolution, denoising, and deblurring, as demonstrated by its performance on multiple benchmarks.
