Face identification (FI) is a widely used method in law enforcement for making important decisions. However, the current approach of comparing two images using cosine similarity of their embeddings is not effective in generalizing to new types of images that were not included in the training set or gallery, such as masked, cropped, or rotated faces. To address this issue, we propose a re-ranking approach that utilizes the Earth Mover's Distance to compare faces based on their deep, spatial features of image patches. Our additional comparison stage allows for a more detailed analysis of image similarity, specifically focusing on fine-grained features like eyes to eyes. This approach proves to be more robust against out-of-distribution perturbations and occlusions compared to traditional FI methods. Importantly, our method consistently improves accuracy for all tested out-of-distribution queries, including masked, cropped, rotated, and adversarial faces. Notably, our method achieves these improvements without the need for finetuning feature extractors.
