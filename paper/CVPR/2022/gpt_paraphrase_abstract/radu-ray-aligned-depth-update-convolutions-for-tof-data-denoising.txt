Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras often suffer from high levels of noise and distortions caused by Multi-Path-Interference (MPI). Recent research has shown that 2D neural networks can surpass traditional State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods in correcting ToF-Data. However, there has been limited exploration of learning-based approaches that directly utilize the 3D information available in depth images. This paper introduces an iterative correcting approach that operates in 3D space and learns from 2.5D data using 3D point convolutions to fix the positions of points along the view direction. Since labeled real world data is scarce for this task, the network is further trained using a self-training approach on unlabeled real world data to consider real world statistics. The proposed method outperforms SOTA methods on multiple datasets, including two real world datasets and a new large-scale synthetic dataset introduced in this paper.
