The abstract discusses the use of cross-modal retrieval techniques in visible-infrared (RGB-IR) person re-identification (Re-ID) to enable person identification in 24-hour surveillance systems. While existing methods focus on image-to-image matching, this paper explores video-to-video matching, which provides richer spatial and temporal information. A video-based RGB-IR dataset is created, consisting of 927 identities, 463,259 frames, and 21,863 tracklets from 12 cameras. The study demonstrates that increasing the number of frames in a tracklet improves performance, highlighting the importance of video-to-video matching in RGB-IR person Re-ID. A novel method is proposed that projects both modalities into a modal-invariant subspace and extracts temporal memory for motion-invariant representation. This approach achieves better results in video-based cross-modal person Re-ID. The code and dataset are available at the provided link.
