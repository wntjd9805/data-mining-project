Learning single image deraining (SID) networks without paired clean and rainy images is challenging. Existing unpaired learning methods are insufficient to learn the relationship between rainy inputs and clean outputs due to significant domain gap. In this paper, we propose a dual contrastive learning framework called DCD-GAN for unpaired SID. It consists of two cooperative branches: Bidirectional Translation Branch (BTB) and Contrastive Guidance Branch (CGB). BTB uses adversarial consistency to generate exemplar pairs and explores latent feature distributions between domains through bidirectional mapping. CGB constrains the embeddings of different exemplars in the deep feature space by encouraging similar feature distributions to be closer and dissimilar ones to be further away. This helps facilitate rain removal and image restoration. Our method outperforms existing unpaired deraining approaches on synthetic and real-world datasets, and achieves comparable results to fully-supervised or semi-supervised models.
