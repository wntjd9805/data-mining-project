Recent advancements in surface reconstruction techniques have shown success in utilizing deep neural networks to learn functions that represent surfaces as level sets, such as signed distance fields. However, many of these methods are limited to learning closed surfaces and cannot accurately reconstruct shapes with boundary curves. To address this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid shape representation that combines explicit boundary curves with implicit learned interiors. To achieve this, we leverage concepts from geometric measure theory to parameterize currents using deep networks. By employing stochastic gradient descent to solve a minimal surface problem, we can effectively represent surfaces with both explicitly defined boundary curves and implicitly defined shapes. Additionally, we can modify the metric based on target geometry derived from sources like meshes or point clouds, enabling us to represent a wide range of surfaces.Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to learn families of shapes that are jointly parameterized by boundary curves and latent codes. This allows for the efficient exploration and generation of diverse shapes within a learned shape space.In summary, our proposed hybrid shape representation combines explicit boundary curves with implicit learned interiors, enabling the reconstruction of surfaces with boundary curves. The approach utilizes deep networks to parameterize currents and employs stochastic gradient descent to solve a minimal surface problem. By adapting the metric based on target geometry, arbitrary surfaces can be represented. Additionally, our method supports the joint parameterization of families of shapes using both boundary curves and latent codes.
