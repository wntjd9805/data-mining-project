Current studies on few-shot semantic segmentation primarily focus on extracting information about the target object, but often struggle to identify ambiguous regions, particularly in non-target regions such as the background (BG) and distracting objects (DOs). To address this issue, we propose a new framework called the Non-Target Region Eliminating (NTRE) network, which aims to explicitly identify and eliminate BG and DO regions in the query. Our approach consists of three main modules. First, we introduce the BG Mining Module (BGMM) to extract the BG region by learning a general BG prototype. We supervise the learning process of BGMM using a BG loss, which only utilizes the known target object segmentation ground truth. Next, we propose a BG Eliminating Module and a DO Eliminating Module to successively filter out BG and DO information from the query feature. By doing so, we can obtain a target object segmentation result that is free from BG and DO interference. Additionally, we enhance the model's ability to distinguish the target object from DOs by introducing a prototypical contrastive learning algorithm. This algorithm improves the model's discriminative capabilities. We evaluate our approach on the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets through extensive experiments, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method despite its simplicity.
