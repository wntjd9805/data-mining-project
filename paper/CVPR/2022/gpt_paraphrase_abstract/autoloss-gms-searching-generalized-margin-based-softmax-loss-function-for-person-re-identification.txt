Person re-identification is a popular area of research in computer vision, and the choice of loss function greatly impacts the effectiveness of learned features. However, most existing models rely on hand-crafted loss functions, which are often sub-optimal and difficult to design. This paper introduces a new method called AutoLoss-GMS, which automatically searches for a better loss function within the space of generalized margin-based softmax loss functions for person re-identification. The proposed method decomposes the generalized margin-based softmax loss function into two computational graphs and a constant. A searching framework based on evolutionary algorithms is then used to efficiently search for the optimal loss function. The computational graph is constructed using a forward method, allowing for the creation of more diverse loss function forms compared to existing methods that use a backward method. Additionally, the method incorporates cross-graph mutation operations to enhance the diversity of offspring. Several strategies, including the loss-rejection protocol, equivalence-check strategy, and predictor-based promising-loss chooser, are developed to improve the efficiency of the search. Experimental results demonstrate that the searched loss functions achieve state-of-the-art performance and can be applied to different models and datasets in person re-identification.
