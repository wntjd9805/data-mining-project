This paper introduces a new approach called RU-Net for scene graph generation (SGG). SGG involves detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Existing SGG methods face challenges such as ambiguous object representations and low diversity in relationship predictions. To address these issues, the authors propose RU-Net. First, they analyze the relationship between graph neural network-based message passing (GMP) and graph Laplacian denoising (GLD) using the unrolling technique. They show that GMP can be seen as a solver for GLD. Building on this insight, they introduce an unrolled message passing module and a graph regularization technique to reduce spurious connections between nodes.Second, they propose a group diversity enhancement module that promotes the diversity of relationship predictions by employing rank maximization. They conduct systematic experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of RU-Net across various settings and metrics.Additionally, RU-Net achieves new state-of-the-art results on three popular databases: VG, VRD, and OI. The code for RU-Net is available at https://github.com/siml3/RU-Net.
