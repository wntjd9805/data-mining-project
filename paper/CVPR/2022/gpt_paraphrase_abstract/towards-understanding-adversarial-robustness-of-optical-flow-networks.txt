The lack of robustness of optical flow networks to physical patch-based attacks has raised serious concerns, particularly in the automotive industry. This paper aims to analyze the underlying cause of this problem and identifies the classical aperture problem of optical flow estimation, along with poor choices in network architecture, as the main culprits. The authors propose solutions to rectify these issues and make optical flow networks more resistant to physical patch-based attacks. Furthermore, the paper explores global white-box attacks in the context of optical flow. It is found that targeted white-box attacks can manipulate flow estimation models to produce desired outputs, but this requires access to input images and model weights. On the other hand, universal attacks are shown to be ineffective against optical flow networks. The code related to this research can be accessed at the provided link.
