We propose an online tracking algorithm called MeMOT that combines object detection and data association in a unified framework. MeMOT is capable of linking objects over long time spans by maintaining a large spatio-temporal memory to store the identity embeddings of tracked objects. It also adaptively references and aggregates useful information from the memory as needed. MeMOT consists of three main modules, all based on the Transformer architecture. The first module, Hypothesis Generation, generates object proposals in the current video frame. The second module, Memory Encoding, extracts core information from the memory for each tracked object. The third module, Memory Decoding, simultaneously solves the object detection and data association tasks for multi-object tracking. MeMOT achieves competitive performance when evaluated on popular MOT benchmark datasets.
