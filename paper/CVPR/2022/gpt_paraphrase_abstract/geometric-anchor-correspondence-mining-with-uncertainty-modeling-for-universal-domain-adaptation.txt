This paper introduces a new framework called GATE, which aims to address the challenges of universal domain adaptation (UniDA). UniDA involves transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain without constraints on the label space. The main challenges in UniDA are domain shift and category shift, which make it difficult to recognize both shared "known" samples and private "unknown" samples. Previous approaches have not explored the intrinsic geometrical relationship between the two domains and have relied on manually setting a threshold for rejecting "unknown" samples using an overconfident closed-world classifier.To overcome these issues, GATE proposes a Geometric anchor-guided Adversarial and conTrastive learning framework with uncErtainty modeling. The framework consists of several components. First, a random walk-based anchor mining strategy and a high-order attention mechanism are used to establish correspondence between the domains. Then, a global joint local domain alignment paradigm is designed, incorporating geometric adversarial learning for global distribution calibration and subgraph-level contrastive learning for local region aggregation. To improve the detection of target private samples, GATE introduces a universal incremental classifier that models energy uncertainty. It also generates novel categories through manifold mixup and minimizes the open-set entropy to adaptively learn the "unknown" threshold. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that GATE outperforms previous state-of-the-art UniDA methods significantly.
