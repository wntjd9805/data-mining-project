The Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) technique is used to generate high-quality synthetic views from a set of input images. However, traditional methods use processed images with limited dynamic range. In this study, we modify NeRF to train directly on raw images, preserving the full dynamic range of the scene. By rendering the raw output, we can perform high dynamic range (HDR) view synthesis and manipulate various parameters like focus, exposure, and tonemapping. Despite the increased noise in raw images, NeRF proves to be robust when optimized over multiple inputs. In fact, our method, RawNeRF, outperforms dedicated denoisers on wide baseline input images, allowing for scene reconstruction even in low-light conditions.
