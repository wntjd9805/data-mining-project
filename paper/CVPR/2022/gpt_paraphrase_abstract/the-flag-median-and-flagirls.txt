This study introduces a new subspace prototype, called the flag median, for Grassmann-valued datasets. Existing subspace prototypes have proven to be computationally expensive or affected by outliers. The flag median is robust to outliers and can improve clustering on Grassmannians. The FlagIRLS algorithm is proposed to calculate the flag median, which converges in 4 iterations on a synthetic dataset. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that using the flag median in algorithms like Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) leads to improved cluster purity compared to other leading algorithms such as the â„“2-median and flag mean.
