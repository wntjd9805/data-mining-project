We present a plug-and-play acceleration framework for semi-supervised video object segmentation that leverages the temporal redundancies in compressed video bitstreams. Our method involves a motion vector-based warping technique to propagate segmentation masks from keyframes to other frames in a bi-directional and multi-hop manner. Additionally, we introduce a residual-based correction module to rectify incorrectly propagated segmentation masks caused by noisy or erroneous motion vectors. Our approach is versatile and can be integrated with existing video object segmentation algorithms. We have obtained highly competitive results on DAVIS17 and YouTube-VOS datasets using various base models, achieving significant speed improvements of up to 3.5X with minimal loss in accuracy.
