Layout design is a common practice in various fields such as architecture and urban planning, involving a time-consuming iterative process. Recently, deep learning techniques have been used to automatically generate layouts through image generation, offering the potential to alleviate designers from repetitive tasks. However, while automation can enhance productivity, the input of designers remains crucial. An ideal AI-assisted design tool should automate repetitive tasks while also incorporating human guidance and providing intelligent suggestions. Unfortunately, existing methods mostly neglect the involvement of humans and rely on end-to-end approaches. In light of this, we propose a novel generative model called iPLAN, which operates with human interaction throughout the entire design process. iPLAN can automatically generate layouts while allowing designers to actively participate, enabling a gradual evolution of rough concepts into final designs. We evaluate iPLAN on diverse datasets and compare it with existing methods. The results demonstrate that iPLAN produces layouts similar to those created by human designers, offers flexibility in accepting designer inputs, provides tailored design suggestions, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities when faced with new design tasks and limited training data.
