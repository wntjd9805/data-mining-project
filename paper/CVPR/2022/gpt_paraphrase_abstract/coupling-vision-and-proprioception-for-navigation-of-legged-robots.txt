Our goal is to develop a navigation system called VP-Nav for legged robots that combines vision and pro-prioception to maximize their capabilities in traversing complex terrains. Unlike wheeled robots, legged systems have the advantage of being able to navigate challenging environments. However, to fully utilize this advantage, it is necessary for the navigation system to have a high-level path planner that takes into account the walking abilities of the low-level locomotion policy in different environments. To achieve this, we use proprioceptive feedback to ensure the safety of the planned path by detecting unexpected obstacles such as glass walls, terrain properties like slipperiness or softness of the ground, and robot properties like extra payload that may not be detectable by vision alone.Our navigation system utilizes onboard cameras to generate an occupancy map and a cost map to guide the robot towards its goal. A fast marching planner then generates a target path based on these maps. A velocity command generator takes this path as input and calculates the desired velocity for the walking policy. Additionally, a safety advisor module incorporates information about unexpected obstacles into the occupancy map and environment-determined speed limits into the velocity command generator.Through our experiments, we demonstrate that VP-Nav outperforms wheeled robot baselines and ablation studies that separate high-level planning and low-level control. Furthermore, we showcase the real-world deployment of VP-Nav on a quadruped robot equipped with onboard sensors and computation.
