This study introduces RigNeRF, a system that expands upon existing volumetric neural rendering methods like NeRFs to allow for the manipulation of objects within a scene, specifically focusing on head pose and facial expressions. By incorporating a 3D morphable face model (3DMM) as a prior, RigNeRF is able to accurately model changes in head pose and facial expressions using a deformation field. This enables the generation of novel poses and expressions that were not present in the original video input. The effectiveness of RigNeRF is demonstrated through experiments using a short video captured on a smartphone, showcasing its ability to synthesize portrait scenes with precise control over head pose and expressions.
