Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerging technology used in time-of-flight (ToF) 3D cameras. These cameras can capture the precise arrival time of individual photons, allowing for accurate depth estimation. Currently, SPAD-based 3D cameras determine depth by creating a histogram of photon timestamps, which measures the round-trip time of a laser pulse. However, as the resolution of SPAD-based cameras improves, the data rates they produce exceed the capabilities of existing data transfer technologies.The main reason for the high data rates is the strong connection between depth resolution and histogram resolution. To address this issue, we propose using compressive single-photon histograms (CSPHs). CSPHs are a compressed representation of the high-resolution histogram that is created on-the-fly as each photon is detected. We achieve this compression using linear coding schemes, which can be expressed as a simple matrix operation. We have designed various CSPH coding schemes for 3D imaging and evaluated their performance under different conditions, such as signal and background levels, laser waveforms, and illumination setups.Our findings demonstrate that a well-designed CSPH can significantly reduce data rates by 1-2 orders of magnitude without compromising the precision of depth measurements. By implementing CSPH in SPAD-based 3D cameras, we can overcome the limitations imposed by current data transfer technologies and enable the capture of high-resolution 3D images with reduced data transmission requirements.
