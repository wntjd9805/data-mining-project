Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has achieved significant success using supervised learning. However, current TAL methods are limited by the closed set assumption, making them incapable of handling unknown actions in open-world scenarios. This paper introduces the Open Set TAL (OSTAL) problem and proposes a novel framework called OpenTAL, based on Evidential Deep Learning (EDL). OpenTAL consists of three components: uncertainty-aware action classification, actionness prediction, and temporal location regression. The proposed EDL method utilizes importance-balanced learning to capture classification uncertainty by focusing on important samples. To distinguish unknown actions from background video frames, actionness is learned through positive-unlabeled learning. Additionally, classification uncertainty is calibrated using guidance from temporal localization quality. OpenTAL is a general framework that can be applied to existing TAL models in open set scenarios. Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
