This paper introduces a new approach called quantization-aware deep optics for diffractive snapshot hyperspectral imaging. Previous deep optics frameworks have struggled with limited performance due to a mismatch between the optical hardware and reconstruction algorithm caused by quantization operations in diffractive optical element (DOE) fabrication. The authors propose integrating the quantization operation into the DOE height map optimization and designing an adaptive mechanism to adjust the physical height of each quantization level. By fabricating the quantized DOE directly and building a diffractive hyperspectral snapshot imaging system, their method improves the practicality of the deep optics framework by systematically matching the fabricated DOE with the reconstruction algorithm. Synthetic simulations and hardware experiments confirm the superior performance of their approach.
