Learning from continuously changing data distributions with incorrect labels is a difficult but important problem in real-world scenarios. Most existing methods for continual learning assume clean labels in data streams, leaving online learning scenarios with noisy data streams largely unexplored. This study focuses on a more practical task setup: online learning from blurry data streams with corrupted labels, where current continual learning methods struggle.   To address this task, the study emphasizes the significance of both diversity and purity of examples in the episodic memory of continual learning models. It proposes a novel strategy to manage and utilize the memory by employing label noise aware diverse sampling and robust learning through semi-supervised learning.   The proposed method is evaluated on four real-world and synthetic noise datasets (CI-FAR10 and 100, mini-WebVision, and Food-101N). The results demonstrate that the method outperforms previous approaches in this challenging continual learning scenario.
