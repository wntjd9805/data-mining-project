We present CAPRI-Net, a self-supervised neural network that learns concise and understandable representations of 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models. These representations are in the form of adaptive assemblies of primitive shapes. By using constructive solid geometry (CSG) operations, our network reconstructs input 3D shapes by assembling quadric surface primitives. Without relying on ground-truth shape assemblies, our network is trained using a reconstruction loss, resulting in accurate 3D reconstructions with sharp edges and plausible CSG trees. While CAD models have predictable local properties due to their parametric nature, they exhibit significant structural and topological variations at the overall shape level. This poses a challenge for state-of-the-art neural models for 3D shapes. To address this challenge, our network employs adaptive training for each test shape, fine-tuning the pre-trained network using the specific shape. We evaluate our learning framework on ShapeNet and ABC, the largest and most diverse CAD dataset available, focusing on criteria such as reconstruction quality, sharp edges, compactness, and interpretability. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing alternatives for neural CAD reconstruction.
