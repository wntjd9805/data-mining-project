Accurate and diverse human motion prediction is crucial for various industrial applications like robotics and autonomous driving. Previous studies have explored methods to improve diversity while maintaining accuracy in human motion prediction. However, most of these methods require defining a combined loss and determining the weights as hyperparameters before training. In this research, we aim to develop a prediction framework that can balance accuracy and diversity sampling during testing. To achieve this, we propose a multi-objective conditional variational inference prediction model. We also introduce a short-term oracle to encourage the framework to explore more diverse future motions. We assess the performance of our approach using two standard human motion datasets and find that it is effective and comparable to state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and diversity.
