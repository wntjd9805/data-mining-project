This paper introduces a novel method called SC2-PCR 1 for efficient and robust point cloud registration (PCR). The method utilizes a second order spatial compatibility (SC2) measure to evaluate the similarity between correspondences. Unlike previous methods that focus on local consistency, SC2 considers global compatibility, which enables better differentiation between inliers and outliers at an early stage. The registration pipeline employs a global spectral technique to identify reliable seeds from the initial correspondences. A two-stage strategy is then implemented to expand each seed into a consensus set using the SC2 measure matrix. Finally, a weighted SVD algorithm is applied to each consensus set to generate a candidate rigid transformation, and the best model is selected as the final result. This approach ensures the discovery of outlier-free consensus sets with fewer samplings, leading to improved efficiency and robustness in model estimation. Furthermore, the SC2 measure is versatile and can be easily integrated into deep learning frameworks. The performance of the proposed method is extensively evaluated through experiments.
