Contemporary change detection methods in visual surveillance, anomaly detection, and mobile robotics assume perfect matching between current and stored scenes, limiting their performance in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SimSaC, a method that combines scene flow estimation and change detection to detect changes even with imperfect matches. We introduce a training scheme using random geometric transformations and the cut-paste method to train SimSaC without manual labeling. Additionally, we design an evaluation protocol that reflects real-world performance and provide a test benchmark dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that SimSaC achieves robust performance with imperfect matches, significantly outperforming contemporary approaches.
