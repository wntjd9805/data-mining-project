The importance of data in machine learning cannot be overstated, as the quantity and quality of training data often have a greater impact on system performance than the architecture and training details. However, collecting and processing real data on a large scale is challenging, expensive, and raises concerns related to privacy, fairness, and legality. Synthetic data offers a solution to these issues by being cost-effective, allowing for rich annotations, providing full control over the data, and addressing problems related to bias, privacy, and licensing. Unfortunately, the tools for generating synthetic data are not as advanced as those for architecture design and training, leading to fragmented efforts in data generation. In response to these challenges, we introduce Kubric, an open-source Python framework that collaborates with PyBullet and Blender to generate realistic scenes with detailed annotations. Kubric is capable of seamlessly scaling to large-scale jobs distributed over multiple machines, generating terabytes of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Kubric by presenting 13 different datasets generated for various tasks, such as studying 3D NeRF models and estimating optical flow. We make Kubric, the used assets, generation code, and rendered datasets available for reuse and modification. Figure 1 showcases an example scene created and rendered using Kubric, along with some automatically generated annotations.
