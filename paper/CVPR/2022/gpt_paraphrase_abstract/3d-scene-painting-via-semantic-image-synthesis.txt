We present a new method for creating 3D scene paintings using a customizable layout. Our method takes a 3D scene with semantic labels as input and trains a network to generate color values for the scene. We utilize a pre-existing 2D image synthesis method to train the painting network without explicit color guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces images with accurate geometric structures and enables scene manipulation, including changes in viewpoint, object poses, and painting style. Our method offers extensive control over the synthesized images' 3D geometry.
