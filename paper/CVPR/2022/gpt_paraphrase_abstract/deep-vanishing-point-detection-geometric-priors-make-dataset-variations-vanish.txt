Deep learning has made significant advancements in detecting vanishing points in images. However, these deep networks have limitations such as the need for expensive annotated datasets and specialized hardware, as well as their inability to generalize to slightly different domains and minor variations of the problem. In this study, we propose a solution to these issues by incorporating prior knowledge into deep vanishing point detection networks. This prior knowledge eliminates the need to learn from data, saving time and resources required for annotation and computation. It also allows for realistic scenarios with limited samples and reduces the impact of domain changes. Additionally, the interpretability of the priors enables the adaptation of deep networks to minor problem variations, such as the transition between Manhattan and non-Manhattan worlds. We integrate two geometric priors, namely the Hough Transform and Gaussian sphere, which respectively map image pixels to straight lines and lines to great circles whose intersections represent vanishing points. Through experiments, we evaluate our choices and demonstrate comparable accuracy to existing models in the context of large datasets. We validate the improved data efficiency, robustness to domain changes, and adaptability to non-Manhattan settings of our proposed model.
