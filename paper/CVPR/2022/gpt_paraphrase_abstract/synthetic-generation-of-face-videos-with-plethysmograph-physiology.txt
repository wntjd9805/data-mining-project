The availability of datasets for Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) is limited, hindering progress in non-contact physiological measurement. Existing datasets lack diversity and do not include diverse populations, resulting in accuracy disparities across different demographic groups. This paper proposes a biophysical learning-based method to generate realistic synthetic rPPG videos, which can enhance physiological measurement and reduce bias. Additionally, the authors introduce the UCLA-rPPG dataset, the largest of its kind, which includes diverse subject skin tones. This dataset aims to serve as a benchmark for different skin tones in rPPG research and promote healthcare equity. The dataset can be accessed at https://visual.ee.ucla.edu/rppg_avatars.htm/.
