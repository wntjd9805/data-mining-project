Developing appropriate and reliable evaluation measures for new applications is crucial for guiding research. Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) is one such application that requires evaluation measures. The current practice for evaluating VMR systems is to use R@K, θ. However, this measure has two disadvantages. Firstly, it does not consider the rank positions of successfully localized moments in the top-K list, treating the list as a set. Secondly, it binarizes the Intersection over Union (IoU) of each retrieved video moment using a threshold, disregarding the fine-grained localization quality.  To address these issues, we propose an alternative measure called Average Max IoU (AxIoU) for evaluating VMR. This measure overcomes the rank insensitivity and the binarization of IoU. We demonstrate that AxIoU satisfies two important axioms for VMR evaluation: Invariance against Redundant Moments and Monotonicity with respect to the Best Moment. On the other hand, R@K, θ only satisfies the first axiom.   We also conduct empirical examinations to compare AxIoU with R@K, θ and determine its stability with changes in test data and human-annotated temporal boundaries.
