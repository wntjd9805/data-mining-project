Despite the success of deep learning in general object detection, the detection of small objects remains unsatisfactory in terms of performance and efficiency. Current methods rely on high-resolution images or feature maps, which significantly increase computational costs. To address this issue, we propose QueryDet, a novel approach that utilizes a query mechanism to enhance the inference speed of feature-pyramid based object detectors. Our approach involves two steps: firstly, it predicts the coarse locations of small objects using low-resolution features, and then it computes accurate detection results using high-resolution features guided by the coarse positions. This allows us to benefit from high-resolution feature maps while avoiding unnecessary computation for the background area. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our method improves the detection mean average precision (mAP) by 1.0 and mAP-small by 2.0, while achieving a 3.0× improvement in high-resolution inference speed on average. Furthermore, on the VisDrone dataset, which contains a higher number of small objects, our method sets a new state-of-the-art while achieving an average 2.3× acceleration in high-resolution inference speed. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/ChenhongyiYang/QueryDet-PyTorch.
