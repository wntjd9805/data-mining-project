This paper introduces a novel approach called Infrared Shape Network (ISNet) for detecting small and dim infrared targets in noisy and cluttered backgrounds. The proposed method addresses the challenge of extracting precise shape information from infrared targets. It consists of two key components: the Taylor finite difference (TFD)-inspired edge block and the two-orientation attention aggregation (TOAA) block. The TFD-inspired edge block enhances edge information at different levels to improve contrast between targets and background, enabling the extraction of shape information. The TOAA block utilizes attention mechanisms to capture low-level information in both row and column directions and combines it with high-level information to accurately represent target shapes and suppress noise. The authors have also created a benchmark dataset called IRSTD-1k, which includes 1,000 realistic images with various target shapes, sizes, and clutter backgrounds, along with pixel-level annotations. Experimental results on public datasets and IRSTD-1k demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art methods for infrared small target detection. The dataset and code for the proposed method are available on GitHub at github.com/RuiZhang97/ISNet.
