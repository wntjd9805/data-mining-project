We investigate the problem of accurately finding correspondences for point cloud registration. Traditional methods rely on detecting repeatable keypoints, which is challenging in scenarios with low overlap. However, recent keypoint-free approaches have shown promise by using down-sampled superpoints and propagating them to dense points. These methods match superpoints based on overlapping neighboring patches. However, this sparse and loose matching requires contextual features that capture the geometric structure of the point clouds. To address this, we propose the Geometric Transformer, which learns geometric features for robust superpoint matching. It encodes pair-wise distances and triplet-wise angles, making it resilient in low-overlap cases and invariant to rigid transformations. Surprisingly, our simple design achieves high matching accuracy, eliminating the need for RANSAC in aligning transformations and resulting in a 100 times speedup. Our method improves the inlier ratio by 17-30 percentage points and the registration recall by over 7 points on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark.
