Recognition in low quality face datasets is difficult due to obscured and degraded facial attributes. Recent advancements in margin-based loss functions have improved the discriminability of faces in the embedding space. Previous studies have explored the use of adaptive losses to assign greater importance to misclassified examples. In this study, we introduce a new aspect of adaptiveness in the loss function, specifically considering the image quality. We argue that the emphasis on misclassified samples should be adjusted based on their image quality. To address this, we propose a new loss function that highlights samples of different difficulties according to their image quality. Our approach achieves this by using an adaptive margin function that approximates the image quality using feature norms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, named AdaFace, outperforms the state-of-the-art on four datasets (IJB-B, IJB-C, IJB-S, and TinyFace). The code and models are publicly available.
