Recent advancements in Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection techniques have been heavily influenced by the Transformer-based object detector (DETR). However, most of these techniques simply map parametric interaction queries to HOI predictions using a vanilla Transformer in a single-stage approach, thereby neglecting the rich inter- and intra-interaction structure. In this study, we propose a new Transformer-style HOI detector called Structure-aware Transformer over Interaction Proposals (STIP). This design breaks down the process of HOI set prediction into two phases: first, an interaction proposal generation is performed, and then the non-parametric interaction proposals are transformed into HOI predictions using a structure-aware Transformer. The structure-aware Transformer improves upon the vanilla Transformer by encoding both the holistic semantic structure among interaction proposals and the local spatial structure of humans/objects within each interaction proposal, thereby enhancing the accuracy of HOI predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of STIP, outperforming state-of-the-art HOI detectors.
