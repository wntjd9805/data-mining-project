Recurrent models are commonly used in deep learning-based video super-resolution due to their computational efficiency and ability to capture temporal information. However, these models can generate high-frequency artifacts when applied to long video sequences with low motion. This instability issue has not been addressed in previous studies on video super-resolution. To address this problem, we introduce a new dataset called Quasi-Static Video Set, which highlights the instabilities of existing recurrent VSR networks on long sequences with low motion. We propose a new framework called Middle Recurrent Video Super-Resolution (MRVSR) based on Lipschitz stability theory to create a stable and competitive recurrent VSR network. We empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of MRVSR on long sequences with low motion.
