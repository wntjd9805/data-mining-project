Accurately predicting the future movements of surrounding traffic participants is crucial for autonomous driving. However, predicting multiple plausible trajectories remains a challenging task due to the numerous possibilities. Existing proposal-based prediction methods typically employ a two-stage approach involving intention classification and motion regression to address the issue of multiple potential trajectories. This study introduces a novel two-stage proposal-based motion forecasting technique that utilizes sliced lane segments as detailed, shareable, and interpretable proposals. To encode the shape and interaction information between map sub-graphs and agent sub-graphs, we employ Graph neural network and Transformer models. Additionally, we propose a variance-based non-maximum suppression strategy to select representative trajectories that ensure diversity in the final output. Experimental results on the Argoverse dataset demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Both the use of lane segments-based proposals and the variance-based non-maximum suppression strategy contribute to the improved performance. Furthermore, we show that our method achieves reliable performance with lower collision rates and fewer off-road scenarios in closed-loop simulations.
