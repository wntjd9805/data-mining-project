This paper introduces a novel approach called RIIS for robust invertible image steganography. Existing methods in image steganography have limitations in terms of hiding capacity and robustness, often being susceptible to distortions in container images. RIIS addresses these issues by implementing a conditional normalizing flow to model the distribution of high-frequency components, along with a container enhancement module (CEM) for improved reconstruction. A distortion-guided modulation (DGM) is also employed to regulate network parameters for different distortion levels, making the model adaptable to various scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RIIS effectively enhances robustness while maintaining imperceptibility and capacity in both clean and distorted image steganography. This work is the first to propose a learning-based scheme for improving the robustness of image steganography, which expands its potential applications in real-world scenarios.
