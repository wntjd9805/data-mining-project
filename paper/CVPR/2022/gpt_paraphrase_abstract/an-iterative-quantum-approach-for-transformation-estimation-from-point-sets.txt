We suggest a new approach to estimate rigid transformations from point sets using adiabatic quantum computation. In contrast to current quantum methods, our approach utilizes an adaptive scheme to achieve high precision and avoids inconsistent rotation matrices. In experimental tests, our method demonstrates strong performance on various 2D and 3D datasets, even when faced with a high ratio of outliers.
