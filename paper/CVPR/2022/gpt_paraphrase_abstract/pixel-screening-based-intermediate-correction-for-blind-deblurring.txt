Blind deblurring has garnered significant attention due to its practical applications. Typically, the blind deblurring problem is solved by iteratively estimating the intermediate kernel and image, ultimately converging to the blurring kernel of the observed image. Previous methods have incorporated regularization techniques to minimize undesirable artifacts in the intermediate images. However, these approaches struggle when handling images with saturations and large blurs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a method that employs Bayes posterior estimation to analyze the intermediate image and exclude unfavorable pixels, reducing their impact on kernel estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the accuracy of the derived kernel compared to state-of-the-art methods, as validated through quantitative and qualitative comparisons on benchmark datasets.
