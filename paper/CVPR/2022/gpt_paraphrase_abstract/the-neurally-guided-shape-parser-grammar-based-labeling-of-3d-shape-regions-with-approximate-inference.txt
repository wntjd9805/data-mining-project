We present the Neurally-Guided Shape Parser (NGSP), a technique for accurately assigning detailed semantic labels to different regions of a 3D shape. NGSP tackles this problem by using Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference, which models the probability of a label assignment based on a given shape using a learned likelihood function. To make the search process manageable, NGSP incorporates a neural guide network that approximates the posterior probability. NGSP identifies high-probability label assignments by first generating proposals using the guide network and then assessing each proposal using the full likelihood. We evaluate NGSP on the fine-grained semantic segmentation task of 3D shapes from Part-Net, where shapes are divided into regions corresponding to part instance over-segmentations. Our results demonstrate that NGSP outperforms alternative methods that utilize regions for per-point predictions, use regions as self-supervision, or assign labels to regions under different formulations. Additionally, NGSP exhibits robust performance even when provided with limited labeled data or noisy input shape regions. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of NGSP to CAD shapes from online repositories and validate its effectiveness through a perceptual study.
