The objective of shape space learning is to map a set of shapes to a latent representation space in a way that allows for good generalization. Real-world collections of shapes often exhibit symmetries, which are transformations that preserve the essence of the shape. To incorporate these symmetries in shape space learning, it is desirable for the mapping to the shape space and from the shape space to be equivariant to the relevant symmetries. This paper introduces a framework that achieves equivariance in encoders and decoders by making two key contributions: (i) adapting the Frame Averaging (FA) framework to build generic, efficient, and maximally expressive equivariant autoencoders, and (ii) constructing autoencoders that are equivariant to piecewise Euclidean motions applied to different parts of the shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction of a fully piecewise Euclidean equivariant autoencoder. Training our framework is straightforward as it utilizes standard reconstruction losses without the need for additional losses. Our architectures are built using standard backbone architectures with the appropriate frame averaging to ensure equivariance. Experimental results on both rigid shapes dataset using implicit neural representations and articulated shape datasets using mesh-based neural networks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen test shapes, surpassing relevant baselines by a large margin. Notably, our method significantly improves generalization to unseen articulated poses.
