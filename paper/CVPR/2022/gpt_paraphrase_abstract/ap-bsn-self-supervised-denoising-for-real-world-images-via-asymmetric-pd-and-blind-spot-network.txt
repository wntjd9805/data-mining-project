The Blind-spot network (BSN) and its variations have made significant progress in self-supervised denoising. However, they are limited to synthetic noisy inputs due to impractical assumptions such as pixel-wise independent noise. This poses a challenge when dealing with spatially correlated real-world noise using self-supervised BSN. A recent technique called pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) has been introduced to address the spatial correlation of real-world noise. However, integrating PD and BSN directly is not straightforward, which hinders the development of a fully self-supervised denoising model for real-world images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an Asymmetric PD (AP) method that uses different PD stride factors for training and inference. Our systematic demonstrations show that AP resolves the inherent trade-offs caused by specific PD stride factors, making BSN applicable to practical scenarios. As a result, we present AP-BSN, a state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising approach for real-world sRGB images. Additionally, we propose random-replacing refinement, which significantly enhances the performance of AP-BSN without introducing any additional parameters. Extensive studies confirm that our method outperforms other self-supervised and unpaired denoising methods by a large margin, without requiring any additional knowledge, such as noise level, about the underlying unknown noise.
