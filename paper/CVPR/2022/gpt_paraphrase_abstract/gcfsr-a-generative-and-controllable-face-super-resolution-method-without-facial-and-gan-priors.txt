We present a new approach called GCFSR for face image super resolution, which aims to restore realistic details and preserve identity information without relying on additional priors. GCFSR utilizes an encoder-generator architecture with two modules, style modulation and feature modulation, for multi-factor super resolution. The style modulation generates realistic face details, while the feature modulation dynamically combines encoded features and generated ones based on the upscaling factor. The architecture can be trained from scratch in an end-to-end manner. For small upscaling factors, GCFSR achieves impressive results using only adversarial loss. By adding L1 and perceptual losses, GCFSR outperforms existing methods for larger upscaling factors. During testing, the generative strength can be adjusted through feature modulation by changing the conditional upscaling factor. The code for GCFSR is available at https://github.com/hejingwenhejingwen/GCFSR.
