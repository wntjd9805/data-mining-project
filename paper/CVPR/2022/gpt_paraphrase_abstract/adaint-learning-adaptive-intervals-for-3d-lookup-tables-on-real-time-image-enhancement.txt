The 3D Lookup Table (3D LUT) is a useful tool for enhancing images in real-time. It represents a non-linear color transformation by discretizing it into a 3D lattice. Previous studies have focused on learning the output color values of LUTs for flexible enhancement but have overlooked the importance of the sampling strategy. They use a sub-optimal uniform sampling approach, which limits the expressiveness of the learned LUTs because linear interpolation between uniform sampling points may not accurately capture local non-linearities. To address this issue, we propose AdaInt (Adaptive Intervals Learning), a mechanism that adaptively learns non-uniform sampling intervals in the 3D color space. This allows a 3D LUT to increase its capabilities by densely sampling color ranges that require highly non-linear transforms and sparsely sampling near-linear transforms. AdaInt can be implemented as a compact and efficient plug-and-play module for a 3D LUT-based method. To enable end-to-end learning of AdaInt, we introduce a differentiable operator called AiLUT-Transform (Adaptive Interval LUT Transform) that locates input colors in the non-uniform 3D LUT and provides gradients to the sampling intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that methods equipped with AdaInt achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with minimal overhead increase.
