This paper introduces a novel approach for semantic segmentation using Class Activation Map (CAM) to model pixel relations. Unlike previous methods that use pairwise affinity and coarse segmentation, our approach utilizes Partial CAM to achieve better localization performance. We also propose Partial Class Activation Attention (PCAA) to address intra-class inconsistency by incorporating local and global class-level representations for attention calculation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous strategies in terms of pixel relation. Additionally, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks such as Cityscapes, Pascal Context, and ADE20K. The code for our method is available at the provided GitHub link.
