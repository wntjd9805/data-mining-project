We present a novel lossless image compression method that addresses the issue of performance drop in the high-frequency region. Unlike existing methods, which treat low and high-frequency areas equally, our approach separates and processes them differently. We first compress the low-frequency components and then use them as additional input for encoding the high-frequency region. This utilization of low-frequency information as a strong prior improves estimation in the high-frequency area. Moreover, our method incorporates adaptability to factors such as color channel, spatial location, and image characteristics during the frequency decomposition process. Consequently, our method determines an image-specific optimal ratio of low and high-frequency components. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to benchmark high-resolution datasets.
