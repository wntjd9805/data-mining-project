Rich semantics within an image create a complex and ambiguous relationship with other images. Two images may be similar in one aspect but different in another. Weakly Supervised Conditional Similarity Learning (WS-CSL) addresses this issue by learning multiple embeddings that match semantic conditions without explicit labels. However, the uncertainty of similarity relationships in a triplet arises when only a condition is provided. We propose a novel evaluation criterion that predicts the correctness of comparisons by assigning learned embeddings to their optimal conditions. This criterion measures the coverage of latent semantics by WS-CSL as a supervised model.   To address this challenge, we introduce the Distance Induced Semantic Condition Verification Network (DISCOVERNET). DISCOVERNET characterizes the relations between instances and conditions in a "decompose-and-fuse" manner. To ensure that the learned embeddings cover all semantics, DISCOVERNET utilizes a set module or an additional regularizer to establish correspondence between triplets and conditions.   DISCOVERNET achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as UT-Zappos-50k and Celeb-A, based on different evaluation criteria.
