Deep learning methods in medical imaging rely on well-labeled large-scale datasets, but annotating these datasets requires experienced radiologists and is time-consuming. Few-shot learning has been developed to address this issue by achieving competitive performance with only a few labeled data. However, the selection of template images for annotation before learning, which greatly impacts the final performance, has been overlooked. In this study, we propose a novel Sample Choosing Policy (SCP) for few-shot medical landmark detection. SCP consists of three parts: self-supervised training to build a pre-trained deep model for feature extraction, KeyPoint Proposal for localizing informative patches, and Representative Score Estimation for finding the most representative samples or templates. We demonstrate the advantage of SCP through experiments on three widely-used public datasets. For one-shot medical landmark detection, SCP reduces the mean radial errors on the Cephalometric and HandXray datasets by 14.2% (from 3.595mm to 3.083mm) and 35.5% (from 4.114mm to 2.653mm), respectively.
