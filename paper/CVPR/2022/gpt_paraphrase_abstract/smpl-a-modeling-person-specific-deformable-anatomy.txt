This study introduces a novel approach to estimate the deformation of internal organs in response to changes in human body pose. Current methods for locating target anatomical structures in medical scans either require frequent intraoperative scans, which expose patients to higher radiation levels, or rely on sub-optimal proxy procedures that constrain clinicians and impose additional costs and time on patients. In this work, a learning-based method is proposed that utilizes medical scans to learn a patient-specific representation of the organ's shape and elastic properties. This representation is then used to estimate the organ's deformation in real-time based on the patient's current body pose information. The proposed method is evaluated on a well-sized dataset augmented with real clinical data using finite element modeling. The results demonstrate that the pose-dependent organ deformation can be learned using a point cloud autoencoder conditioned on the parametric pose input. This research contributes to the advancement of human mesh recovery and anatomical reconstruction, with potential applications beyond the medical field.
