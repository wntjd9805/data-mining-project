Few-shot learning is a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled data and the problem of model overfitting. To address these challenges, researchers have recently developed semi-supervised few-shot learning approaches that use pseudo-labels of unlabeled samples to expand the support set. However, the relationship between unlabeled and labeled data is not effectively leveraged in generating these pseudo-labels, leading to noisy labels that can harm the model learning process. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a method called Clustering-based semi-supervised Few-Shot Learning (cluster-FSL) for image classification. The method utilizes a novel Multi-Factor Clustering (MFC) approach that combines multiple factors to represent the few-shot data distribution. This allows for the generation of soft and hard pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples based on the information from labeled data. The pseudo labels obtained through MFC are then used to expand the support set, providing more distribution information. In addition, robust data augmentation techniques are employed during the fine-tuning phase to increase the diversity of labeled samples in the support set. The effectiveness of the cluster-FSL method is demonstrated through experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and CUB-200-2011. The results show that our MFC approach effectively fuses distribution information from labeled samples and produces high-quality pseudo-labels.
