This paper introduces a new crowd detection framework that is based on query-based detection. Existing query-based detectors have two limitations: they often generate multiple predictions for a single object, particularly in crowded scenes, and their performance decreases as the depth of the decoding stage increases. To overcome these limitations, we propose a progressive predicting method that addresses these issues. Our method first selects accepted queries that are likely to generate accurate predictions and then refines the remaining noisy queries based on the accepted predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of query-based detectors in crowded scenes. When applied to the CrowdHuman dataset, our approach, called SparseRCNN, achieves an average precision (AP) of 92.0%, a miss rate at a signal-to-noise ratio of -2 (MR-2) of 41.4%, and a Jaccard index (JI) of 83.2%. These results surpass the performance of the box-based method MIP, which is specifically designed for crowded scenarios. Furthermore, our proposed method remains effective even on moderately and slightly crowded datasets like CityPersons and COCO. The code for our method will be publicly available at https://github.com/megvii-model/Iter-E2EDET.
