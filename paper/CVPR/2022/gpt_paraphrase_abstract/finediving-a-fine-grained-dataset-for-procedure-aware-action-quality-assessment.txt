Many current methods for assessing the quality of actions in videos rely on deep features of the entire video, leading to less reliable predictions and poor interpretability. This study argues that understanding the high-level meaning and internal temporal structures of actions in competitive sports videos is crucial for accurate and interpretable predictions. To address this, the researchers have created a new dataset called FineDiving, which focuses on diving events and includes detailed annotations on action procedures. They also propose a procedure-aware approach for action quality assessment, utilizing a Temporal Segmentation Attention module. This approach involves parsing action instances into consecutive steps with diverse semantic and temporal correspondences. A procedure-aware cross-attention is used to learn embeddings between query and exemplar steps, allowing for the discovery of semantic, spatial, and temporal correspondences. This information is then used for fine-grained contrastive regression to derive a reliable scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing methods and offers better interpretability. The dataset and code for this study are available at the provided GitHub link.
