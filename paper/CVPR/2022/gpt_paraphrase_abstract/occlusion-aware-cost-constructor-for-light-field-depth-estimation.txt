Matching cost construction is an important step in depth estimation using light field (LF), but it has been largely neglected in the deep learning era. Current deep learning-based methods for LF depth estimation use a complex and time-consuming approach of sequentially shifting sub-aperture images (SAI) with predefined offsets to construct the matching cost. In this study, we propose a simple and efficient cost constructor for LF depth estimation. Our cost constructor consists of a series of convolutions with specifically designed dilation rates. By applying this cost constructor to SAI arrays, we can integrate pixels with predefined disparities and construct the matching cost without the need for shifting operations. Importantly, our proposed cost constructor is capable of handling occlusions by dynamically adjusting pixels from different views. Using this cost constructor, we develop a deep network for LF depth estimation. Our network achieves the best performance in terms of mean square error (MSE) on the widely used 4D LF benchmark and also has a faster running time compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
