Many existing face relighting methods can handle diffuse shadows but struggle with hard shadows, particularly those caused by the nose. Techniques proposed to address hard shadows often fail to produce shadows that are geometrically consistent because they do not directly utilize the estimated face geometry during synthesis. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new differentiable algorithm that utilizes ray tracing to synthesize hard shadows. This algorithm is integrated into our face relighting model during training. By directly leveraging the estimated face geometry, our proposed algorithm generates geometrically consistent hard shadows. Our experimental results on Multi-PIE and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous face relighting methods in terms of both shadow consistency and overall face relighting performance under directional lighting. Furthermore, we show that our differentiable hard shadow modeling enhances the quality of the estimated face geometry compared to diffuse shading models.
