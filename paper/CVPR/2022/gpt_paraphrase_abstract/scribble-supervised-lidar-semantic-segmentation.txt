The high cost and time required to densely annotate LiDAR point clouds hinders keeping up with the increasing data volume. Current research focuses on fully-supervised methods, overlooking the potential of efficient techniques that utilize weak supervision. This study introduces the use of scribbles for annotating LiDAR point clouds and introduces the ScribbleKITTI dataset, the first dataset with scribble annotations for LiDAR semantic segmentation. Additionally, a pipeline is presented to address the performance gap that arises from using weak annotations. The pipeline consists of three independent contributions that can be combined with any LiDAR semantic segmentation model, achieving up to 95.7% of the fully-supervised performance with only 8% labeled points. The scribble annotations and code are accessible at github.com/ouenal/scribblekitti.
