We introduce Task Discrepancy Maximization (TDM), a module for fine-grained few-shot classification that aims to identify discriminative details like eyes and beaks to distinguish similar classes. TDM localizes class-specific regions by highlighting channels that encode distinct class information. It learns task-specific channel weights using two components: Support Attention Module (SAM) and Query Attention Module (QAM). SAM calculates support weights based on labeled support sets, but it may be biased towards these sets. To address this, QAM generates query weights that prioritize object-relevant channels for a given query image. The combination of these weights defines class-specific channel weights, which are applied to produce feature maps that focus on discriminative details. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of TDM and its advantages over previous methods in fine-grained few-shot classification.
