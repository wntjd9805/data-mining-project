Recently, there has been significant progress in open-vocabulary object detection using vision-language pre-training. This involves training detectors on a set of base classes and then using a text encoder to generate class text embeddings, which are used as region classifiers to train the detector. The success of this approach relies on carefully designed prompts, which can be time-consuming to engineer.To address this issue, some methods have been proposed for learning prompt representations for image classification tasks. However, these methods are not optimal when applied to the detection task. In this paper, we present a new method called detection prompt (DetPro) for learning continuous prompt representations specifically for open-vocabulary object detection. DetPro differs from previous classification-oriented methods in two main ways. Firstly, it includes proposals in the image background in the prompt training using a background interpretation scheme. Secondly, it separates proposals in the image foreground using a context grading scheme for tailored prompt training.We combine DetPro with ViLD, a state-of-the-art open-world object detector, and conduct experiments on various datasets including LVIS, Pascal VOC, COCO, and Objects365. The experimental results demonstrate that our DetPro outperforms the baseline ViLD in all settings, with improvements of 3.4 APbox and 3.0 APmask on the novel classes of LVIS. The code and models for DetPro are available at https://github.com/dyabel/detpro.
