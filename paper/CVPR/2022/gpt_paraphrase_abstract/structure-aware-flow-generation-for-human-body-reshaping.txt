This study focuses on body reshaping in portrait photo retouching and addresses the limitations of existing methods. Previous approaches either utilize 3D models or rely on keypoint-based image deformation, resulting in inefficiency and unsatisfactory visual quality. To overcome these shortcomings, the researchers propose an end-to-end flow generation architecture guided by body structural priors such as skeletons and Part Affinity Fields. This approach allows for unprecedented control over body reshaping performance, regardless of poses and garments. Additionally, a compositional attention mechanism is introduced to capture both visual perceptual correlations and structural associations of the human body, ensuring consistency in manipulation across related body parts. To evaluate the effectiveness of their approach, the researchers construct a large-scale body reshaping dataset called BR-5K, which includes 5,000 portrait photos and professionally retouched targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that their method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of visual performance, controllability, and efficiency. The dataset is available for access on their website: https://github.com/JianqiangRen/FlowBasedBodyReshaping.
