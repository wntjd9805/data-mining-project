This paper addresses the issue of the fear of sketching and proposes a solution to enable users to sketch without worry. The authors conducted a pilot study and found that the presence of noisy strokes is more relevant than the fear of sketching itself. They developed a stroke subset selector using Reinforcement Learning that identifies and retains only the strokes that contribute positively to successful retrieval. When combined with pre-trained retrieval models, this approach achieved a significant improvement of 8%-10% compared to standard baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that the trained selector can be used in various sketch applications to enhance functionality.
