We introduce a unique hierarchical method called HARA for handling multiple rotation averaging. Our approach involves incrementally initializing a rotation graph using a hierarchy of triplet support. The main concept is to construct a spanning tree by prioritizing edges with strong triplet supports and gradually adding weaker and less supported edges. This strategy minimizes the inclusion of outliers in the spanning tree. Consequently, we achieve a robust initial solution that allows us to identify and remove outliers before performing nonlinear optimization. Additionally, our method can easily incorporate knowledge about the number of valid 2D-2D correspondences. We extensively evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real datasets, and our results showcase its superiority compared to existing methods.
