Deep face recognition (FR) systems have achieved impressive results in identification and verification tasks. However, they raise concerns about privacy due to the extensive surveillance they enable, particularly with regards to public face images shared on social networks. Some studies have used adversarial examples to protect photos from unauthorized face recognition systems. However, existing methods for generating adversarial face images have limitations, such as poor visual quality, reliance on a white-box setting, and weak transferability. These limitations make it challenging to apply these methods in real-world scenarios to protect face privacy.  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel face protection method called adversarial makeup transferGAN (AMT-GAN). The aim of AMT-GAN is to construct adversarial face images that maintain strong black-box transferability and high visual quality. AMT-GAN utilizes generative adversarial networks (GAN) to synthesize adversarial face images by transferring makeup from reference images. A new regularization module and joint training strategy are introduced to reconcile conflicts between the adversarial noises and the cycle consistence loss in makeup transfer. This achieves a desirable balance between the strength of the attack and the visual changes.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, AMT-GAN not only preserves a visually pleasing quality but also achieves a higher success rate in attacking commercial FR APIs, including Face++, Aliyun, and Microsoft Azure. These results indicate that AMT-GAN is effective in protecting face privacy while maintaining a high level of attack success.
