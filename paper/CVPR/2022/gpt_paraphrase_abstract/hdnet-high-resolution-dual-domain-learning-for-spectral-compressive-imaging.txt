The rapid advancement of deep learning has improved the reconstruction of hyperspectral images (HSI). However, current learning-based methods have two main drawbacks. Firstly, networks with self-attention sacrifice internal resolution in order to balance model performance and complexity, resulting in the loss of fine-grained high-resolution features. Secondly, even if the optimization focusing on spatial-spectral domain learning (SDL) converges to the ideal solution, there is still a noticeable visual difference between the reconstructed HSI and the actual truth. To address these issues, we propose a high-resolution dual-domain learning network (HDNet) for HSI reconstruction. Our approach incorporates an HR spatial-spectral attention module, which efficiently fuses features to provide continuous and fine pixel-level features. Additionally, we introduce frequency domain learning (FDL) to narrow the discrepancy in the frequency domain during HSI reconstruction. The use of dynamic FDL supervision ensures that the model reconstructs fine-grained frequencies and compensates for excessive smoothing and distortion caused by pixel-level losses. The combination of HR pixel-level attention and frequency-level refinement in HDNet enhances the perceptual quality of the reconstructed HSI. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both simulated and real HSI datasets.
