The task of estimating the 6DoF object pose by establishing correspondences from an image to 3D has been a focus for a long time. Sparse templates have been replaced by deeply learned dense maps to improve the accuracy of pose prediction. Dense methods have also shown advancements in handling occlusion. Recently, researchers have achieved improvements by learning object fragments as segmentation. In this study, we introduce a discrete descriptor that efficiently represents the object surface. By incorporating hierarchical binary grouping, the object surface can be encoded effectively. Additionally, we propose a training strategy that starts with coarse predictions and gradually refines them, enabling fine-grained correspondence prediction. Finally, we estimate the 6DoF pose by matching predicted codes with the object surface and utilizing a PnP solver. Our results on the public LM-O and YCB-V datasets demonstrate significant advancements compared to the state of the art, particularly in the ADD(-S) metric. In some cases, our approach even surpasses RGB-D based methods. Figure 1 illustrates how our method assigns a discrete code to each surface vertex hierarchically, using binary black and white values that are learned through deep neural networks. Our binary descriptor efficiently enables one-to-one correspondence for the problem of 6DoF object pose.
