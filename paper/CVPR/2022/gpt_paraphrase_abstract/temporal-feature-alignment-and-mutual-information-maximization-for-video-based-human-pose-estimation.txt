Multi-frame human pose estimation is a challenging task in computer vision, especially in videos where fast motion and pose occlusion occur frequently. Current methods attempt to improve pose estimation by incorporating visual information from neighboring frames. However, these methods overlook the fact that the alignment between pose features of the current frame and neighboring frames is often poor, leading to unsatisfactory results. Additionally, existing approaches rely on a simple pose estimation loss that does not effectively utilize information from neighboring frames.To address these issues, we propose a novel hierarchical alignment framework that progressively updates neighboring frames to align with the current frame at the feature level. This is achieved through coarse-to-fine deformations. We also introduce explicit supervision for knowledge extraction from neighboring frames to ensure the extraction of useful complementary cues. To accomplish this, we analyze the mutual information between frames and design a loss function that maximizes task-relevant mutual information.Our approach achieves impressive results, ranking first in the Multi-frame Person Pose Estimation Challenge on the PoseTrack2017 dataset. It also outperforms existing methods on benchmarks such as Sub-JHMDB and Pose-Track2018. We have made our code publicly available on GitHub in the hopes that it will benefit the research community.
