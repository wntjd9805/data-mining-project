Creating a comprehensive understanding of animal behaviors is crucial for various applications. However, current animal behavior datasets have limitations, including a small number of animal classes, limited data samples, provided tasks, and limited variations in environmental conditions and viewpoints. To overcome these limitations, we have developed AnimalKingdom, a diverse and extensive dataset. AnimalKingdom includes wild animal footage captured at different times of the day in various environments, featuring diverse backgrounds, viewpoints, illumination, and weather conditions. The dataset consists of 50 hours of annotated videos for the video grounding task, 30K video sequences for fine-grained multi-label action recognition, and 33K frames for pose estimation. It encompasses 850 species across six major animal classes. This comprehensive and challenging dataset aims to facilitate the development, adaptation, and evaluation of advanced methods for animal behavior analysis. Additionally, we introduce the Collaborative Action Recognition (CARe) model, which learns general and specific features for action recognition, even with unseen animals. Our experiments demonstrate promising performance for this method. The AnimalKingdom dataset can be accessed at https://sutdcv.github.io/Animal-Kingdom.
