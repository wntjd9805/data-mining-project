Video deblurring has made significant advancements with the help of deep neural networks. However, most existing methods lack effective information propagation from the video sequence, resulting in limited deblurring capabilities. This is because different regions within each frame exhibit distinct characteristics and require specific relevant information. To address this issue and achieve high-quality deblurring, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a memory branch. This memory branch stores pairs of blurry and sharp features in a memory bank, allowing us to provide valuable information for the deblurring process. Additionally, we enhance the memory bank by introducing bidirectional recurrency and a multi-scale strategy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance, while still maintaining low complexity and inference time.
