Multi-view clustering has become increasingly popular as it allows for the exploration of common semantics from multiple perspectives. However, existing approaches fail to consider the conflict between learning consistent common semantics and reconstructing inconsistent view-private information. To address this issue, we propose a new framework for contrastive multi-view clustering called multi-level feature learning. Our method learns different levels of features, such as low-level features, high-level features, and semantic labels/features, in a fusion-free manner. This enables us to effectively achieve the reconstruction objective and consistency objectives in different feature spaces. We conduct the reconstruction objective on the low-level features and two consistency objectives based on contrastive learning on the high-level features and semantic labels respectively. These objectives allow the high-level features to effectively explore common semantics and the semantic labels to achieve multi-view clustering. Consequently, our framework reduces the negative impact of view-private information. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art clustering effectiveness.
