Deep networks have achieved impressive results in various imaging inverse problems. However, these networks are typically trained using clean signals, which are difficult to obtain. Equivariant imaging (EI) is a self-supervised learning framework that utilizes the inherent invariance of signal distributions to learn reconstruction functions solely from partial measurement data. Although EI has shown promising results, its performance deteriorates in the presence of noise. To address this limitation, we propose a Robust Equivariant Imaging (REI) framework that can learn to reconstruct images from noisy partial measurements alone. Our method incorporates Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) to obtain a fully unsupervised training loss that is robust against noise. Experimental results demonstrate that REI significantly improves performance in both linear and nonlinear inverse problems, thereby enabling robust unsupervised imaging with deep networks. The code for implementing the proposed framework is publicly available at https://github.com/edongdongchen/REI.
