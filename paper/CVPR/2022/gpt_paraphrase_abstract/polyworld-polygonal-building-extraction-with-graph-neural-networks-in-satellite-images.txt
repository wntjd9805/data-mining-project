This study presents PolyWorld, a novel neural network that addresses the need for precise vector polygons in geographic and cartographic applications. Unlike existing methods that produce binary segmentation masks, PolyWorld directly extracts building vertices from images and correctly connects them to create accurate polygons. The model employs a graph neural network to predict the connection strength between each pair of vertices and solves a differentiable optimal transport problem to estimate the assignments. Additionally, the vertex positions are optimized by minimizing a combined loss that considers both segmentation and polygonal angle differences. PolyWorld surpasses the current state-of-the-art in building polygonization, delivering notable quantitative results and visually pleasing building polygons. The code and trained weights for PolyWorld are publicly available at https://github.com/zorzi-s/PolyWorldPretrainedNetwork.
