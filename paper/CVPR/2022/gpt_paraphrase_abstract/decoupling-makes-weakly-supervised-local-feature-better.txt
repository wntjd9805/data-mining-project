Weakly supervised learning is a technique used to address the challenge of acquiring a large dataset with labeled correspondences for local feature methods. However, current approaches that directly conduct weakly supervised learning within a joint training pipeline face limitations due to the inability to distinguish losses caused by detection and description steps. In this study, we propose a decoupled training pipeline, specifically designed for weakly supervised local feature learning. Our pipeline separates the detection step from the description step and delays it until discriminative and robust descriptors are learned. Additionally, we introduce a line-to-window search strategy that utilizes camera pose information to improve descriptor learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, named PoSFeat (Camera Pose Supervised Feature), which outperforms both fully and weakly supervised methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks.
