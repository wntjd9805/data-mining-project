Omnidirectional cameras are commonly used to gain a better understanding of the surrounding environment. These cameras are often set up as stereo systems to estimate depth. However, the fisheye lens used in these cameras makes it difficult to apply conventional epipolar geometry to the images. As a result, intermediate formats like equirectangular images have been used, but they have lower stereo matching performance due to image distortion near the poles. In this study, we propose a new subdivision scheme for a spherical geodesic grid to address this distortion problem. This subdivision scheme allows for more isotropic sampling of spherical image information in the omnidirectional camera space. By extending the existing equal-arc scheme, our spherical geodesic grid is tessellated with an equal-epiline subdivision scheme to ensure uniform cell sizes and distances. This allows for accurate stereo matching and reduces the memory required by 20% compared to traditional cylindrical and cubemap-based approaches.
