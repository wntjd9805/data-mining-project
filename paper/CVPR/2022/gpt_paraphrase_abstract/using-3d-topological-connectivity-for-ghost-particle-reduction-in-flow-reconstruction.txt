Volumetric flow velocimetry in experimental fluid dynamics relies on reconstructing the 3D positions of tracer particles detected in images captured by multiple cameras. This reconstruction is based on the assumption that the particles accurately follow the observed flow, allowing their displacement over a known time interval to be used as a measure of local flow velocity. However, due to the large number of particles typically imaged in a 1 Megapixel image (around 103-104), there are often many consistent but incorrect reconstructions that need to be eliminated using tracking or intensity constraints. In an alternative method called 3D Particle Streak Velocimetry (3D-PSV), the exposure time is increased and the particles' pathlines are captured as "streaks" in the images. We treat these streaks as connected endpoints or conic section segments and develop a theoretical model to explain how 3D ambiguities are generated. Our model demonstrates that streaks can significantly reduce reconstruction ambiguities. Furthermore, we propose a method to simultaneously estimate the short, low-curvature conic section segments and their 3D positions from multiple camera views. Our experimental results validate the theory, showing that the streak and conic section reconstruction method produces fewer ambiguities compared to simple particle reconstruction. In fact, it outperforms the current state-of-the-art particle tracking software in the evaluated cases.
