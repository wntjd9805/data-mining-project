Supervised denoising methods face limitations in practical applications due to the scarcity of large-scale noisy-clean image pairs. Although existing unsupervised methods can learn image denoising without ground-truth clean images, they either exhibit poor performance or operate under impractical conditions, such as requiring paired noisy images. This paper introduces a practical unsupervised image denoising approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our method only needs a single noisy image and a noise model, which are readily available for raw image denoising in practical scenarios. It involves two iterative steps: (1) Creating a dataset with noisier versions of the noisy image using random noise from the noise model. (2) Training a model on this dataset and using the trained model to refine the noisy images, obtaining the targets for the next iteration. Additionally, we approximate our full iterative method with a fast algorithm to enhance training efficiency while maintaining its original high performance. Experimental results on real-world, synthetic, and correlated noise demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised denoising approach outperforms existing unsupervised methods and performs competitively with supervised methods. Furthermore, we argue that current denoising datasets are of low quality and consist of only a limited number of scenes. To evaluate the performance of raw image denoising in real-world applications, we construct a high-quality raw image dataset called SenseNoise-500, comprising 500 real-life scenes. This dataset serves as a robust benchmark for better assessing raw image denoising performance. We will release the code and dataset.
