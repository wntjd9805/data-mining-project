Multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for decision-making in autonomous systems like self-driving cars. However, existing prediction models are developed independently from perception modules and assume accurate past trajectories as inputs. This leads to a significant decrease in performance when real-world noisy tracking results are used. The degradation is caused by error propagation from tracking to prediction, including noisy tracks, fragments, and identity switches. To address this issue, we propose a novel prediction approach that utilizes detections and their affinity matrices across frames as inputs, eliminating the need for error-prone data association during tracking. By making predictions directly from affinity matrices, which contain soft information about detection similarity and identity, our method retains more information than traditional approaches that rely on tracklets generated through data association. Experimental results on large-scale autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our affinity-based prediction scheme reduces overall prediction errors by up to 57.9% compared to standard pipelines using tracklets as inputs. Moreover, in challenging scenarios with tracking errors, the error reduction is even more significant, reaching up to 88.6%.
