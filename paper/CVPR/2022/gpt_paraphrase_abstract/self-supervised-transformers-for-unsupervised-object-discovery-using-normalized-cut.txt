This paper introduces a graph-based method that utilizes self-supervised transformer features to identify objects in images. The visual tokens in the image are treated as nodes in a weighted graph, with edges representing connectivity scores based on token similarity. By applying a normalized graph-cut, foreground objects can be segmented by grouping self-similar regions. To solve the graph-cut problem, spectral clustering with generalized eigen-decomposition is employed, and the second smallest eigenvector is found to provide a cutting solution based on the absolute value indicating token likelihood for belonging to a foreground object. This approach significantly enhances unsupervised object discovery, outperforming the recent state-of-the-art method LOST by 6.9%, 8.1%, and 8.1% on VOC07, VOC12, and COCO20K respectively. The performance can be further improved by incorporating a second stage class-agnostic detector (CAD). The proposed method can also be extended to unsupervised saliency detection and weakly supervised object detection. For unsupervised saliency detection, the proposed method achieves improved Intersection over Union (IoU) scores on ECSSD, DUTS, and DUT-OMRON compared to the state-of-the-art. For weakly supervised object detection, competitive performance is achieved on CUB and ImageNet datasets. The code for the proposed method is available at the provided URL.
