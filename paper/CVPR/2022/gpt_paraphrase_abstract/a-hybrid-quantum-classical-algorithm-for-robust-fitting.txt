Fitting geometric models to data that contains outliers is extremely difficult. Current computer vision systems use random sampling methods to handle this problem, but these methods do not guarantee optimal results or provide error bounds. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new approaches that bridge the gap between expensive exact solutions and fast heuristics with no quality assurances. In this paper, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for robust fitting. Our main contribution is a new formulation for robust fitting that solves a series of integer programs and produces either a global solution or an error bound. The combinatorial subproblems can be efficiently solved using a quantum annealer, which helps to tighten the error bound. While our use of quantum computing does not overcome the inherent difficulty of robust fitting, our algorithm improves upon random sampling heuristics by providing error bounds. Additionally, our work demonstrates a practical application of quantum computing in computer vision. We present results obtained from both an actual quantum computer (D-Wave Advantage) and simulations.
