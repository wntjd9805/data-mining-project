This paper introduces Sparse-IBRNet (SIBRNet), a method for robust image-based rendering (IBR) on sparse scene geometry through depth completion. Traditional IBR methods rely on a large number of views to reconstruct dense scene geometry, but in practice, the availability of views is limited. When only a few views are provided, these methods suffer from a significant drop in performance due to the sparsity of the scene geometry. The proposed SIBRNet consists of two stages: the geometry recovery (GR) stage and the light blending (LB) stage. In the GR stage, a sparse depth map and RGB image are used as input to predict a dense depth map by exploiting the correlation between the two modalities. To address the inaccuracies in the complete depth map and prevent projection biases during the warping process, the LB stage incorporates a bias-corrected module (BCM) to rectify deviations. It then aggregates modified features from different views to render a novel view.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SIBRNet outperforms recent IBR methods when dealing with sparse scene geometry. Moreover, even when the geometric information is dense, our method generates results that are either comparable or better.
