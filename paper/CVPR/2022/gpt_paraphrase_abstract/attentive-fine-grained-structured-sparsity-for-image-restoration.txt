In recent years, there have been significant advancements in image restoration through the use of large deep models. However, the heavy computational requirements of these models have limited their practical application. To address this issue, it is necessary to reduce the size of the networks while maintaining accuracy. One approach that has shown promise is N:M structured pruning, which makes the model more efficient while still meeting accuracy constraints. However, this approach does not consider the varying computational complexities and performance requirements of different layers within an image restoration network. To optimize the trade-off between efficiency and restoration accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method that determines the pruning ratio for N:M structured sparsity at each layer. Our extensive experimental results on super-resolution and deblurring tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms previous pruning methods significantly. We will provide a publicly available PyTorch implementation of our proposed methods at https://github.com/JungHunOh/SLS_CVPR2022.
