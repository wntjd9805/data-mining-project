We present the Dual-Generator (DG) network for reenacting large-pose faces. By utilizing a 3D landmark detector and a loss function that captures shape variation in large poses, our approach tackles the challenge of reenacting faces with extreme poses. The DG network consists of two modules: the ID-preserving Shape Generator (IDSG) and the Reenacted Face Generator (RFG). The IDSG encodes the reference face's 3D landmarks into a reference landmark code and encodes the source face into a source face code. These codes are combined and decoded to generate target landmarks that replicate the pose and expression of the reference face while preserving the identity of the source face. The RFG, based on the StarGAN2 generator with modifications, takes the target landmarks and source face as inputs to generate the reenacted face with the desired identity, pose, and expression. We evaluate our approach on multiple benchmarks and compare it to state-of-the-art methods.
