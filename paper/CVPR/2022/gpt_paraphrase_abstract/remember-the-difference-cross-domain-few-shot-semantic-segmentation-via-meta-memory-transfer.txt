Current few-shot semantic segmentation methods focus on categories sampled from the same distribution, but this assumption is not always valid. The problem of domain shift reduces the performance of few-shot learning. To address this issue, we propose a challenging cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation task where training and testing are performed on different domains. We introduce a meta-memory bank to improve the generalization of the segmentation network by bridging the domain gap between the source and target domains. The meta-memory stores intra-domain style information from the source domain and transfers it to target samples. Additionally, we utilize a new contrastive learning strategy to leverage knowledge of different categories during training. Negative and positive pairs are generated through memory-based style augmentation. Our proposed method achieves promising results on cross-domain few-shot semantic segmentation tasks on COCO-20i, PASCAL-5i, FSS-1000, and SUIM datasets.
