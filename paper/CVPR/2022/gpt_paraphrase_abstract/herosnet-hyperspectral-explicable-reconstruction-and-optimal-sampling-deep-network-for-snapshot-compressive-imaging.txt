Hyperspectral imaging plays a crucial role in various fields such as remote sensing, agriculture, and medicine. However, existing hyperspectral cameras have limitations in terms of speed, cost, and size. Therefore, there has been significant interest in reconstructing hyperspectral images from low-budget snapshot measurements. Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have shown promise in this area by using a numerical optimization algorithm embedded in a fixed number of phases. However, DUNs currently lack cross-phase feature interaction and adaptive parameter adjustment, which limits their industrial applications. To address this, we propose a new deep network called HerosNet for spectral snapshot compressive sensing (SCI). HerosNet incorporates multiple phases within the ISTA-unfolding framework, allowing for flexible simulation of the sensing matrix and contextual adjustment of the gradient descent step size. It also hierarchically fuses and interacts hidden states from previous phases to effectively recover current hyperspectral image frames. Additionally, HerosNet learns an optimal binary mask to enhance reconstruction performance in a hardware-friendly manner. Through extensive validation on simulated and real datasets, HerosNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin. The source code for HerosNet is publicly available at https://github.com/jianzhangcs/HerosNet.
