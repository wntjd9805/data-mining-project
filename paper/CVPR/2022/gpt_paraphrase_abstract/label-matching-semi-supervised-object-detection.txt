Semi-supervised object detection has seen progress through mean teacher driven self-training. However, previous works fail to fully address the label mismatch problem, resulting in confirmation bias during self-training. This paper introduces the LabelMatch framework, which tackles the label mismatch issue from distribution-level and instance-level perspectives. At the distribution-level, the class distribution of unlabeled data is approximated based on labeled data through Monte Carlo Sampling. This weakly supervised cue is used to guide a re-distribution mean teacher, which utilizes adaptive label-distribution-aware confidence thresholds to provide unbiased pseudo labels for student learning. At the instance-level, a label assignment ambiguity problem between teacher and student models is identified. To solve this, a new label assignment mechanism called proposal self-assignment is proposed. This mechanism incorporates student proposals into the teacher model to generate accurate pseudo labels that match each proposal in the student model. Experiments conducted on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed LabelMatch framework compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
