Tweedie distributions, commonly used in classical statistics for generalized linear models, have now found significance in the field of deep learning. In this study, we introduce a distribution adaptive self-supervised image denoising formula that does not require clean reference images, by combining the recent Noise2Score approach with the saddle point approximation of Tweedie distribution. Our formula is applicable to various noise distributions, without any prior knowledge of the underlying noise distribution. Similar to Noise2Score, our method consists of two steps: score matching using perturbed noisy images, followed by a closed-form denoising formula based on Tweedie's formula independent of the distribution. Additionally, we propose a systematic algorithm to estimate the noise model and parameters for a given set of noisy image data. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy of our method in estimating noise models and parameters, and achieving state-of-the-art self-supervised image denoising performance in both benchmark and real-world datasets.
