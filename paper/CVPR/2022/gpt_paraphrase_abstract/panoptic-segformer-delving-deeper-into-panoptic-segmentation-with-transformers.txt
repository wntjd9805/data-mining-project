Panoptic SegFormer is a novel framework for panoptic segmentation, which combines semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. It introduces three key components to improve the performance and efficiency of the segmentation process. Firstly, it utilizes an efficient deeply-supervised mask decoder that allows attention modules to focus on meaningful semantic regions, leading to improved performance and reduced training time compared to previous methods. Secondly, a query decoupling strategy is employed to separate the responsibilities of the query set, preventing interference between different types of image contents. Lastly, a post-processing method is implemented that considers both classification and segmentation qualities to resolve conflicting mask overlaps, resulting in enhanced accuracy.  To handle multi-scale features, Panoptic SegFormer incorporates DeformableDETR, a faster and more efficient version of DETR. By supervising the attention modules in the mask decoder at different layers, the framework ensures effective attention and improves performance further. Furthermore, Panoptic SegFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on the COCO test-dev dataset, with a 6.2% increase in PQ (Panoptic Quality) over the baseline DETR model. It also demonstrates superior zero-shot robustness compared to existing methods.  Overall, Panoptic SegFormer presents a comprehensive approach to panoptic segmentation, leveraging transformers and innovative components to achieve highly accurate and efficient segmentation results.
