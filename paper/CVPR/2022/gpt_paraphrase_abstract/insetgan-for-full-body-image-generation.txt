We propose a new method for generating full-body human images using multiple pretrained GANs. While GANs have shown the ability to create realistic images in certain domains, generating full-body human images is challenging due to the diversity of identities, hairstyles, clothing, and poses. Instead of using a single GAN to model this complex domain, our method combines multiple GANs. One GAN generates a global canvas representing the human body, while specialized GANs focus on different parts such as faces and shoes. These specialized GANs seamlessly insert their generated parts onto the global canvas. We achieve this by jointly exploring the latent spaces of the respective GANs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we combine a full body GAN with a high-quality face GAN to create realistic human images. We evaluate our results using quantitative metrics and user studies.
