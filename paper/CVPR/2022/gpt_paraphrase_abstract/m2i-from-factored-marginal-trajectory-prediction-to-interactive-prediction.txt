Predicting future movements of vehicles in urban environments is crucial for autonomous driving. While existing models can accurately predict individual vehicle trajectories, it remains a challenge to predict trajectories that are compliant with the overall traffic scene involving multiple vehicles. This is because the prediction space exponentially increases with the number of vehicles. In this study, we address this challenge by considering the relationships between interacting vehicles and breaking down the joint prediction problem into individual prediction problems. Our proposed approach, called M2I, identifies pairs of interacting vehicles as influencers and reactors. We then use a marginal prediction model to predict trajectories for the influencers and a conditional prediction model for the reactors. The predictions from the interacting vehicles are combined and selected based on their joint likelihoods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark.
