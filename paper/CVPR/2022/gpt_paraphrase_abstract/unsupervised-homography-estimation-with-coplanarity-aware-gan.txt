Unsupervised homography estimation from image pairs is an important task in image alignment. While unsupervised learning methods have shown promise in this field, they often overlook the problem of plane-induced parallax, leading to compromised homography predictions on multiple planes. To address this issue, we propose a new method called HomoGAN. Our approach focuses on the dominant plane by utilizing a multi-scale transformer network to predict homography in a coarse-to-fine manner. Additionally, we introduce an unsupervised GAN that imposes a coplanarity constraint on the predicted homography. This is achieved by using a generator to predict a mask of aligned regions and a discriminator to verify if these masked feature maps are induced by a single homography. Through extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of HomoGAN and its components. Our results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by reducing the matching error by 22%. The code for HomoGAN is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/HomoGAN.
