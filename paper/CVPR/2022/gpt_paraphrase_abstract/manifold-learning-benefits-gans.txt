This paper aims to enhance Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by integrating manifold learning into the discriminator. The study explores the use of locality-constrained linear and subspace-based manifolds, as well as locality-constrained non-linear manifolds. The proposed approach involves intertwining manifold learning and coding steps within the discriminator's layers to attract intermediate feature representations towards the manifolds. The discrepancy between feature representations and their manifold view is adaptively balanced to achieve a trade-off between denoising on the manifold and refining it. The research demonstrates that the use of locality-constrained non-linear manifolds yields superior performance compared to linear manifolds, thanks to their non-uniform density and smoothness. The proposed method also surpasses state-of-the-art baseline models by a significant margin.
