We present a new task called dynamic grasp synthesis, which involves generating motions to move an object to a target pose using a known grasp reference. This task is challenging due to the complex hand articulation and physical interaction with the object. To address this, we propose a novel method that combines reinforcement learning and physics simulation to learn and evaluate dynamic interactions. Our hierarchical approach decomposes the task into low-level grasping and high-level motion synthesis, allowing the generation of human-like hand sequences that approach, grasp, and move the object to a desired location. Our method produces stable grasps and a wide range of motions, and can even correct imperfect labels to generate dynamic interaction sequences.
