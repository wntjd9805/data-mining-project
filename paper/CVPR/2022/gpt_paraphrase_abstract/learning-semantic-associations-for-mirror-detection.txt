Detecting mirrors can be difficult due to their inconsistent visual appearance. Previous methods that rely on contextual contrasts and corresponding relations struggle to identify mirrors in complex real-world scenes where other objects may have similar features. To address this, we propose a model that leverages the semantic associations between mirrors and their surrounding objects for accurate mirror localization. Our model utilizes a semantic side-path to acquire class-specific knowledge of the surrounding objects. It also incorporates two novel modules: an Associations Exploration (AE) Module that extracts associations based on fully connected graph models, and a Quadruple-Graph (QG) Module that facilitates the diffusion and aggregation of semantic association knowledge using graph convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the PMD dataset (f-measure: 0.844) and the MSD dataset (f-measure: 0.889). The code for our method is available at https://github.com/guanhuankang/Learning-Semantic-Associations-for-Mirror-Detection.
