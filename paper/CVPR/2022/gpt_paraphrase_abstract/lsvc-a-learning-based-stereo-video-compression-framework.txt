This study presents a novel framework for compressing stereo videos used in autonomous driving applications. The framework reduces temporal redundancy by utilizing motion compensation with adjacent frames and exploits binocular redundancy by employing disparity compensation with cross-view frames. To enhance compression, two innovative schemes are proposed: motion residual compression and disparity residual compression, which generate predicted offsets based on previously compressed information. The entire framework is fully differentiable and can be optimized end-to-end. Experimental results on three automotive stereo video benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms both learning-based single-view video codecs and traditional hand-crafted multi-view video codecs.
