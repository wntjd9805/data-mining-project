This paper introduces FDRNet, a Fourier Document Restoration Network that can effectively restore documents with various distortions and enhance document recognition. FDRNet focuses on high-frequency components in the Fourier space, which contain crucial structural information and are less affected by degradation. It employs a flexible Thin-Plate Spline transformation to dewarp documents, enabling it to handle diverse deformations without the need for deformation annotations during training. This feature allows FDRNet to learn from a small set of simply labeled training images, enabling accurate restoration of documents with complex geometric distortions and precise text recognition. To facilitate further research in document restoration, the authors have created a benchmark dataset comprising over one thousand camera documents with different types of geometric and photometric distortion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDRNet significantly outperforms existing techniques in both dewarping and text recognition tasks. Moreover, FDRNet requires only a minimal amount of labeled training data and is easily deployable. The benchmark dataset can be accessed at https://sg-vilab.github.io/event/warpdoc/.
