Scene text recognition (STR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications. Most existing methods for training STR models rely on fully supervised learning, which requires large amounts of labeled data. While synthetic data has been beneficial for STR, it suffers from a domain gap between real and synthetic images, limiting model performance. This study aims to enhance STR models by utilizing both synthetic data and a large number of real unlabeled images, eliminating the need for human annotation. To address the issue of domain inconsistency between synthetic and real images, a robust consistency regularization based semi-supervised framework is proposed for STR. This framework effectively resolves the problem of instability. Furthermore, a character-level consistency regularization is designed to alleviate misalignment between characters in sequence recognition. Through extensive experiments on standard text recognition benchmarks, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness. It consistently improves existing STR models and achieves state-of-the-art results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of a consistency regularization based framework to STR.
