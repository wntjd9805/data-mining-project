This study focuses on improving the ability of 3D object detectors to detect non-standard object shapes and generalize to out-of-domain data. The researchers propose a novel data augmentation method called 3D-VField, which deforms point clouds using learned vector fields. The approach ensures that points slide along their sensor view rays without adding or removing any points, preserving shape and occlusions. By augmenting the training data with these vector fields, the generalization of the object detectors is significantly enhanced for differently shaped objects and scenes. The researchers also introduce a synthetic dataset called CrashD, which includes realistic damaged and rare cars in various crash scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques on different datasets and sensors, including LiDAR and ToF cameras, for both indoor and outdoor scenes. The CrashD dataset is made available for further research.
