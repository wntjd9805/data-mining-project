Dimensionality reduction is crucial for visualizing and preprocessing high dimensional data in machine learning. We present a new approach that utilizes a hierarchical structure created from 1-nearest neighbor graphs in the original space. This hierarchy preserves the grouping properties of the data distribution across multiple levels. Our method offers an optimization-free projection that is as effective as the latest versions of t-SNE and UMAP but significantly faster at runtime. It is also interpretable, allows for projecting new data, and naturally separates data clusters in visualizations, making it a versatile unsupervised dimension reduction technique. In our paper, we provide a thorough analysis of the proposed method using various datasets ranging from 1K to 11M samples and 28 to 16K dimensions. We compare it to other state-of-the-art methods using multiple metrics and target dimensions, demonstrating its efficiency and performance.
