Active learning (AL) aims to reduce the costs of labeling by selecting the most valuable examples from a pool of unlabeled data. However, identifying these examples becomes more challenging when dealing with high-dimensional data and limited data availability. In this study, we propose a new method called ALFA-Mix for batch active learning. Our approach involves identifying unlabeled instances with distinct features by analyzing inconsistencies in predictions resulting from interventions on their representations. We achieve this by constructing interpolations between representations of labeled and unlabeled instances and examining the predicted labels. By identifying inconsistencies in these predictions, we can discover features that the model is unable to recognize in the unlabeled instances. We have developed an efficient implementation of our method based on a closed-form solution for optimal interpolation, which causes changes in predictions. Through experiments on 12 benchmarks of images, videos, and non-visual data, our method outperforms all recent AL approaches in 30 different settings. We observe significant improvements, particularly in scenarios with limited data and on self-trained vision transformers. In fact, ALFA-Mix outperforms the state-of-the-art in 59% and 43% of the experiments conducted on low-data regimes and self-trained vision transformers, respectively.
