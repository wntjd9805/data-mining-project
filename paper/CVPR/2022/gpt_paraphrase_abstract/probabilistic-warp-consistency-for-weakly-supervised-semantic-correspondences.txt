We introduce a new approach called Probabilistic Warp Consistency for weakly-supervised semantic matching. Instead of relying on traditional supervision methods, we directly supervise the dense matching scores predicted by the network using a conditional probability distribution. To achieve this, we create an image triplet by applying a known warp to one of the images in a pair that represents different instances of the same object class. We use the resulting image triplet to derive our probabilistic learning objectives, taking into account constraints such as occlusion and background clutter found in real image pairs. We also incorporate a learnable unmatched state in our probabilistic output space to handle situations where there is no match. To supervise this state, we design an objective that compares image pairs depicting different object classes. We evaluate our method on four challenging semantic matching benchmarks and apply it to four recent semantic matching architectures. Our weakly-supervised approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our objective also brings significant improvements in the strongly-supervised regime when combined with keypoint annotations.
