We propose a method for learning action segmentation models using weak supervision in the form of sets of actions occurring in training videos. Our approach leverages the observation that videos within the same task have similar action orderings. We introduce an attention-based method with a new Pairwise Ordering Consistency (POC) loss, which ensures that the attentions of actions follow a similar ordering for each common action pair in two videos of the same task. Unlike existing methods, our POC loss efficiently aligns videos with different action orders and is differentiable, allowing for end-to-end training without the need for time-consuming pseudo-label generation. Our method extends attention-based action localization methods to learn multiple actions per video. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art. Moreover, our method can effectively handle the transcript-supervised action learning task with a small modification, where actions and their ordering are available during training.
