Unsupervised point cloud completion is a challenging task that involves estimating the complete point cloud of a partially observed point cloud without paired supervision. This study introduces a new framework that learns a unified latent space capable of encoding both partial and complete point clouds. The framework maps related partial point clouds to multiple complete shape and occlusion code pairs and combines these codes to obtain representations in the unified latent space. To ensure the learning of this structured latent space, the method incorporates various constraints, including structured ranking regularization, latent code swapping constraint, and distribution supervision on the related partial point clouds. This unified and structured latent space enables better consistency between partial and complete geometries and improves shape completion accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods on synthetic ShapeNet and real-world KITTI, ScanNet, and Matterport3D datasets.
