This study focuses on the application of semi-supervised learning in semantic segmentation. In this approach, only a small portion of the training images are labeled, while the rest remain unlabeled. To address the issue of using pseudo labels for the unlabeled images, which often leads to performance degradation, the authors propose a novel method. Their method incorporates an error localization network (ELN), which analyzes an image and its segmentation prediction to identify pixels with potentially incorrect pseudo labels. By disregarding label noises during training, ELN enables robust semi-supervised learning and can be combined with self-training and contrastive learning. Additionally, the authors introduce a new learning strategy for ELN that simulates various segmentation errors to improve its generalization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through evaluations on PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, where it outperforms existing methods in all evaluation settings.
