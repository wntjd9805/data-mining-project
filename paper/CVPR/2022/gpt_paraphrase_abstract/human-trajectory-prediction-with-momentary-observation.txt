The human trajectory prediction task is essential for autonomous systems like self-driving cars and social robots. However, obtaining long observations for accurate prediction is challenging due to tracking losses and sudden events. Limited observation trajectory prediction has been overlooked in previous research. This paper focuses on momentary trajectory prediction, where only two frames are considered: one for social and scene contexts and both for agent velocity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches are rigorously studied on popular benchmarks. Additionally, a unified feature extractor and novel pre-training mechanism are proposed to capture effective information from momentary observations. The extractor can enhance the performance of existing prediction models in momentary trajectory prediction. The aim is to enable more responsive, precise, and robust prediction approaches, bringing us closer to real-world autonomous systems.
