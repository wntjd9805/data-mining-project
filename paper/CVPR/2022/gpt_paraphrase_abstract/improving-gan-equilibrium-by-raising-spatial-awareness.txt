Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved success by training a generator (G) and a discriminator (D) in an adversarial manner. The goal is to reach an equilibrium where D cannot distinguish between real and generated images. However, in practice, this equilibrium is rarely achieved, and D often outperforms G. This is due, in part, to the information asymmetry between D and G. D learns its own visual attention to determine the authenticity of an image, while G lacks explicit knowledge of which regions to focus on. To address this issue and reduce the dominance of D, we propose enhancing the spatial awareness of G. We introduce randomly sampled multi-level heatmaps into the intermediate layers of G, providing it with a bias towards improving the synthesis of specific image regions. Additionally, we align G's spatial awareness with the attention map derived from D, bridging the information gap between the two. Our approach brings the GANs closer to equilibrium, resulting in improved synthesis performance. Furthermore, the introduced spatial awareness facilitates interactive editing of the synthesized output. We provide a demo video and code at https://genforce.github.io/eqgan-sa/.
