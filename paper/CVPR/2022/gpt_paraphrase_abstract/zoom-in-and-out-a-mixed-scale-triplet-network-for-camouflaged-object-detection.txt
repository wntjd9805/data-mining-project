Camouflaged object detection (COD) is a challenging task due to the complex nature of objects blending into their surroundings. In real-world scenarios, camouflaged objects often have high similarity to their background, varying scales, fuzzy appearances, and occlusions. To address these challenges, we propose Zoom-Net, a mixed-scale triplet network inspired by human observation behavior. Zoom-Net utilizes a zoom strategy to learn discriminative mixed-scale semantics through a scale integration unit and hierarchical mixed-scale unit. This approach effectively captures imperceptible clues between candidate objects and their background surroundings. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware loss as a regularization constraint to handle uncertainty and ambiguity stemming from indistinguishable textures. This constraint promotes accurate predictions with higher confidence in candidate regions. Our proposed model outperforms 23 existing state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets, and also demonstrates superior performance compared to recent cutting-edge models on the SOD task.
