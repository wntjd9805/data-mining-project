We introduce Polarity Sampling, a plug-and-play technique that allows for controlling the quality and diversity of output generated by deep generative networks (DGNs). By considering the continuous piecewise affine splines nature of DGNs, we derive an analytical distribution of the output space based on the DGN's Jacobian singular values raised to a power ρ. We refer to ρ as the polarity parameter and demonstrate that it directs the sampling of the DGN towards modes (ρ < 0) or anti-modes (ρ > 0) of the output-space probability distribution. Through experiments, we show that non-zero polarity values outperform standard methods like truncation in terms of precision-recall trade-off. We provide quantitative and qualitative results illustrating the enhancement in overall generation quality, measured by metrics like Fréchet Inception Distance, for various state-of-the-art DGNs (e.g., StyleGAN3, BigGAN-deep, NVAE) across different image generation tasks, both conditional and unconditional. Notably, Polarity Sampling sets new benchmarks for StyleGAN2 on the FFHQ Dataset (FID 2.57), StyleGAN2 on the LSUN Car Dataset (FID 2.27), and StyleGAN3 on the AFHQv2 Dataset (FID 3.95). A Colab Demo is also available.
