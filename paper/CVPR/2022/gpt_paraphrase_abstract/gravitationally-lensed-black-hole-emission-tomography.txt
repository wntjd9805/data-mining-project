The Event Horizon Telescope has allowed us to visualize light emission around a black hole for the first time. Previous measurements have provided a 2D image assuming a static emission field. In this study, we propose BH-NeRF, a new tomography method that utilizes gravitational lensing to reconstruct the continuous 3D emission field near a black hole. This task presents two challenges: the curved paths of rays near black holes due to general relativity, and the limited observations from a single viewpoint. Our approach uses a coordinate-based neural network to capture the unknown emission field as a continuous volumetric function. We also incorporate knowledge of Keplerian orbital dynamics to establish correspondence between 3D points over time. These techniques enable BH-NeRF to accurately recover 3D emission fields, even with sparse measurements and uncertain orbital dynamics. This study demonstrates the potential for future measurements from the Event Horizon Telescope to capture the evolving 3D emission around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.
