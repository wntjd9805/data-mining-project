Line projection modeling for catadioptric cameras with rotationally symmetric mirrors has been partially addressed in specific configurations, but a comprehensive solution for general central and non-central catadioptric cameras is lacking. To fill this gap, we propose a line reflection constraint derived from general point reflection assumptions, which enables us to define a line projection into the image. Through comparisons with previous methods, we demonstrate that our approach yields the same polynomial degrees as configuration-specific systems. To validate our line projection model, we conduct various experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. Furthermore, we apply our methods to an absolute camera pose problem, showcasing the practicality of our approach.
