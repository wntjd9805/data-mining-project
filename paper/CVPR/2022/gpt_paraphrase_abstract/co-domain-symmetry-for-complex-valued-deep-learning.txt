This study focuses on complex-valued scaling, which is a type of symmetry specific to complex-valued measurements and representations. While Deep Complex Networks (DCN) and SurReal have addressed complex-valued algebra and manifold learning respectively, they have not considered complex-valued scaling. In order to address this, the researchers propose novel equivariant/invariant layer functions and architectures that take advantage of co-domain symmetry. They also introduce complex-valued representations of RGB images, where complex-valued scaling represents hue shift or correlated changes across color channels. The performance of these co-domain symmetric (CDS) classifiers is evaluated on various datasets, including MSTAR, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN. The results show that the CDS classifiers outperform DCN and SurReal in terms of accuracy, generalization, robustness to co-domain transformations, and model bias and variance, while utilizing fewer parameters.
