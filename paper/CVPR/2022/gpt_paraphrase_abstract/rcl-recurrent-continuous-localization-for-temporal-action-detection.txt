This paper introduces a new approach called Recurrent Continuous Localization (RCL) for temporal representation in action detection techniques. Currently, state-of-the-art methods use a dense anchoring scheme that samples anchors uniformly over the temporal domain with a discretized grid. RCL, on the other hand, proposes a fully continuous anchoring representation that can detect segments of arbitrary length. This is achieved through an explicit model that incorporates video embeddings and temporal coordinates. To optimize the continuous representation, the paper presents an effective scale-invariant sampling strategy and recurrent refinement of predictions. The continuous anchoring scheme is fully differentiable, making it easy to integrate into existing detectors. Experimental results on two benchmarks show that RCL outperforms other discretized counterparts by approximately 2% mean Average Precision (mAP). Specifically, RCL achieves a mAP@0.5 of 52.92% on the THUMOS14 dataset and a mAP of 37.65% on the ActivityNet v1.3 dataset, surpassing all existing single-model detectors.
