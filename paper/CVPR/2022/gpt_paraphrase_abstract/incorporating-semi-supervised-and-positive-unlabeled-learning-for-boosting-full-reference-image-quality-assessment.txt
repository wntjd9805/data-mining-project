Full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) is commonly used in low-level vision tasks to evaluate the visual quality of a distorted image by comparing it to a pristine-quality reference image. However, collecting pairwise labeled data with mean opinion scores (MOS) for training FR-IQA models can be time-consuming and cumbersome. On the other hand, unlabeled data can be easily obtained from image degradation or restoration processes, making it attractive to exploit this data to improve FR-IQA performance. However, the distribution inconsistency between labeled and unlabeled data can lead to outliers in the unlabeled data, making training more challenging. To address this, we propose incorporating semi-supervised and positive-unlabeled (PU) learning to make use of unlabeled data while mitigating the impact of outliers. In our approach, all labeled data is treated as positive samples, and PU learning is employed to identify negative samples (i.e., outliers) from the unlabeled data. Additionally, semi-supervised learning (SSL) is used to exploit positive unlabeled data by generating pseudo-MOS. We employ a dual-branch network with reference and distortion branches, and introduce spatial attention in the reference branch to focus on informative regions. To address misalignment issues caused by images recovered by GAN models, we use sliced Wasserstein distance for robust difference map computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark datasets including PIPAL, KADID-10k, TID2013, LIVE, and CSIQ.
