The aim of this study is to accurately determine the poses, shapes, and relative depth of multiple people in an image. Estimating depth from an image is challenging without knowledge of the subjects' heights, especially when there is a significant size difference among individuals. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel method called BEV, which incorporates a Bird's-Eye-View representation to reason explicitly about depth. Unlike previous approaches, BEV simultaneously considers body centers in the image and in depth, allowing for the estimation of 3D body position. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that height varies with age, and thus, age estimation is necessary for accurate depth estimation. They leverage a 3D body model space within BEV to infer shapes across different age ranges. To train and evaluate BEV, the authors create a dataset called "RelativeHuman" (RH) that includes age labels and relative depth relationships between people in the images. Experimental results on RH and AGORA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and training scheme. BEV outperforms existing methods in terms of depth reasoning, child shape estimation, and robustness to occlusion. The authors have made their code and dataset publicly available for research purposes.
