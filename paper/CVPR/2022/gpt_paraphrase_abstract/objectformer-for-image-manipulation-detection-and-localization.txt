Advancements in image editing have raised concerns about the reliability of multimedia data, leading to the need for image tampering detection. This research paper introduces ObjectFormer, a method for detecting and pinpointing image manipulations. To identify subtle traces of manipulation that may not be visible in the RGB domain, we extract high-frequency features from the images and combine them with RGB features using multimodal patch embeddings. Furthermore, we utilize a set of learnable object prototypes as intermediate representations to capture object-level consistencies across different regions. These prototypes are then employed to refine patch embeddings and capture patch-level consistencies. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing existing state-of-the-art techniques for tampering detection and localization.
