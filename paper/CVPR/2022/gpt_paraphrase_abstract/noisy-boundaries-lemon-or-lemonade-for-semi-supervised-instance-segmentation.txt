Current methods for instance segmentation heavily rely on pixel-level annotated images, which are expensive to obtain and limit the dataset scale and performance. This paper introduces a framework for semi-supervised instance segmentation that utilizes unlabeled images to improve performance. The framework involves assigning pixel-level pseudo labels, but acknowledges that these labels come with noisy boundaries that have both negative and positive effects. To address this, the paper proposes a noise-tolerant mask head that leverages low-resolution features to combat the negative effects of noisy boundaries. Additionally, a boundary-preserving map is introduced to enhance the positive impacts by learning detailed information within boundary-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, with significant improvements over the supervised baseline on Cityscapes, COCO, and BDD100k datasets. Notably, the method achieves comparable performance on Cityscapes using only 30% labeled images.
