This abstract discusses the importance of affine registration in medical image processing and highlights the lack of research on fast and reliable algorithms for this task. While previous studies have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn both affine and non-parametric registration, the focus has been on the combined performance rather than the standalone performance of the affine subnetwork. Additionally, existing CNN-based approaches either address local misalignment or global orientation and position to predict the affine transformation matrix, making them sensitive to spatial initialization and limited in their ability to generalize beyond the training dataset.To address these limitations, the authors propose a new algorithm called Coarse-to-Fine Vision Transformer (C2FViT) for 3D affine medical image registration. This method utilizes the global connectivity and locality of the convolutional vision transformer, along with a multi-resolution strategy, to learn the global affine registration. The authors evaluate their method on 3D brain atlas registration and template-matching normalization and demonstrate its superiority over existing CNN-based methods in terms of registration accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. Importantly, the proposed algorithm also maintains the runtime advantage of learning-based methods. The source code for C2FViT is publicly available on GitHub.In summary, this abstract introduces a novel learning-based algorithm, C2FViT, for 3D affine medical image registration. The algorithm leverages the strengths of convolutional vision transformers and multi-resolution strategies to achieve superior performance compared to existing methods, while also maintaining the speed advantage of learning-based approaches.
