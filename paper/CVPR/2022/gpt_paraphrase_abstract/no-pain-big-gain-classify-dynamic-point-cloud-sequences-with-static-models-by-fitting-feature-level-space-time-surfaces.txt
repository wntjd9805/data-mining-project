The difficulty of applying flow-based models to dynamic point cloud classification is due to the unstructured nature of the points, making it challenging to establish point-wise correspondences. To address this issue, we propose a kinematics-inspired neural network called Kinet, which incorporates the kinematic concept of ST-surfaces into the feature space. By leveraging the normal solver of ST-surfaces in the feature space, Kinet implicitly captures feature-level dynamics and benefits from established backbones for static point cloud processing. Our framework can be easily trained and deployed alongside a given static model with minimal modifications to network structures and computational overhead. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and versatility of Kinet, achieving an accuracy of 93.27% on MSRAction-3D with only 3.20M parameters and 10.35G FLOPS. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/jx-zhong-for-academic-purpose/Kinet.
