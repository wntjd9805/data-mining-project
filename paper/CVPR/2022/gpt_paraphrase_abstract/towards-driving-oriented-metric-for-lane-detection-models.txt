The dataset and evaluation method used in the 2017 TuSimple Lane Detection Challenge have become the standard for measuring the performance of lane detection methods. However, the effectiveness of this evaluation method in real-world driving scenarios has not been sufficiently studied. In this research, we introduce two new metrics specifically designed for autonomous driving: the End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) and the Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD). We evaluate the validity of these metrics by conducting a large-scale study using four different lane detection approaches on both the TuSimple dataset and our newly created dataset, Comma2k19-LD. Our findings indicate that the conventional metrics used in previous evaluations are strongly negatively correlated with E2E-LD (-0.55 or less). This suggests that recent improvements targeting these conventional metrics may not have resulted in meaningful enhancements for autonomous driving but instead may have worsened performance by overfitting to the conventional metrics. Given the critical importance of safety in autonomous driving systems, the underestimation of robustness impedes the development of practical and reliable lane detection models. We hope that our research will encourage the adoption of more task-specific evaluations for lane detection within the community.
