We present TrackFormer, a novel approach for multi-object tracking (MOT) that addresses the complex challenges of track initialization, identity, and spatio-temporal trajectories. Our method formulates MOT as a frame-to-frame set prediction problem and utilizes an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture. By employing attention mechanisms, our model establishes data association between frames by evolving a set of track predictions throughout the video sequence. The Transformer decoder initializes new tracks using static object queries and continues to track existing objects using track queries that preserve their identities. Both query types benefit from self- and encoder-decoder attention on global frame-level features, eliminating the need for additional graph optimization or modeling of motion and appearance. Despite its simplicity, TrackFormer introduces a new tracking-by-attention paradigm and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MOT17 and MOTS20 datasets. The code for our approach is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/timmeinhardt/trackformer.
