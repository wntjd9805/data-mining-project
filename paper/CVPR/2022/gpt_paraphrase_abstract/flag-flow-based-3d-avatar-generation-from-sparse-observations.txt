Generating realistic and accurate avatar poses is crucial for representing people in mixed reality applications. However, the available signal streams from head-mounted devices (HMDs) are typically limited to head and hand poses. While these signals are valuable, they do not provide a complete representation of the human body, posing a challenge in generating faithful full-body avatars. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a flow-based generative model that utilizes sparse observations to reconstruct the 3D human body. Our model not only learns the conditional distribution of 3D human pose but also establishes a probabilistic mapping from observations to a latent space. This latent space allows us to generate plausible poses along with uncertainty estimates for the joints. Our approach not only serves as a strong predictive model but also proves to be an efficient pose prior in various optimization settings. In these settings, having a good initial latent code is crucial, and our model facilitates this role effectively.
