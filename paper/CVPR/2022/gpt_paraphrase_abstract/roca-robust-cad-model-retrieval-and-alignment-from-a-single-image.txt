We introduce a new method called ROCA 1, which allows for the retrieval and alignment of 3D CAD models from a shape database using a single input image. This approach enables the perception of a 3D scene from a 2D RGB observation, represented by a compact and clean CAD representation. Our method focuses on differentiable alignment optimization, utilizing dense 2D-3D object correspondences and Procrustes alignment. By leveraging these correspondences, ROCA can achieve robust CAD alignment and improve CAD retrieval by learning geometrically similar CAD models. Experimental results on challenging real-world imagery from ScanNet demonstrate that ROCA significantly outperforms existing methods, improving retrieval-aware CAD alignment accuracy from 9.5% to 17.6%.
