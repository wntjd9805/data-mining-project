Meta-learning is a technique used for quickly adapting to new tasks, but it has not been thoroughly explored in regression tasks with high-dimensional inputs like images. This paper aims to address this gap by introducing two new types of vision regression tasks, namely object discovery and pose estimation, in the meta-learning domain for computer vision. The authors evaluate various meta-learning techniques and analyze the impact of deep learning techniques commonly used in recent meta-learning algorithms, such as data augmentation, domain randomization, task augmentation, and meta-regularization. They also provide insights and practical recommendations for training meta-learning algorithms on vision regression tasks. Additionally, the authors propose incorporating functional contrastive learning (FCL) into Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) and training them in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results reveal that prior work's results were misleading due to a poor choice of the loss function and small meta-training sets. CNPs outperform MAML on most tasks without fine-tuning, and it is observed that naive task augmentation without a tailored design leads to underfitting.
