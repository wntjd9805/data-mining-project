The traditional semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are not suitable for real-world applications because they produce biased pseudo-labels due to class imbalance and class distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a pseudo-labeling framework that blends semantic and linear pseudo-labels, as they have complementary properties in terms of bias. The framework, called Distribution-Aware Semantics-Oriented (DASO) Pseudo-label, also introduces a semantic alignment loss to reduce biased predictions from the classifier and establish balanced feature representation. Extensive experiments on imbalanced benchmarks demonstrate that the DASO framework significantly improves SSL learners when both class imbalance and distribution mismatch are dominant.
