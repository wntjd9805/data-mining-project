This paper introduces a new representation called RepSurf for point clouds, which aims to accurately depict the local structure of shapes. Two variants of RepSurf, Triangular RepSurf and Umbrella RepSurf, inspired by triangle meshes and umbrella curvature, are explored. The representations of RepSurf are computed using predefined geometric priors after surface reconstruction. RepSurf can be easily integrated into most point cloud models due to its compatibility with irregular points. The Umbrella RepSurf variant outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification, segmentation, and detection on various benchmarks, with a small increase in parameters, FLOPs, and inference time. For classification, our method achieves 94.7% accuracy on ModelNet40 and 84.6% accuracy on ScanObjectNN. For segmentation, we achieve 74.3% mIoU on S3DIS 6-fold and 70.0% mIoU on ScanNet. In terms of detection, our method achieves 71.2% mAP25 and 54.8% mAP50 on ScanNetV2, and 64.9% mAP25 and 47.7% mAP50 on SUN RGB-D, surpassing previous state-of-the-art detectors when combined with RepSurf. Our lightweight Triangular RepSurf also performs well on these benchmarks. The code for RepSurf is publicly available at https://github.com/hancyran/RepSurf.
