Deep learning models trained on a single domain often struggle to perform well on other domains. This lack of generalizability can be problematic, especially in critical applications like diagnostic imaging where real-world data varies greatly. To address this issue, domain generalization approaches have gained attention, aiming to improve the ability of models trained on one or multiple source domains to generalize to out-of-distribution test domains. In this study, we propose BoosterNet, a supplementary network that can be added to any existing network without altering its architecture or training process. BoosterNet enhances the generalization capability of the core network by training episodically on the most and least culpable data features extracted from critical units in the network. We determine the contribution of these features to class-specific prediction errors using a novel measure of feature culpability. During inference, we extract test image features from the closest class-specific units using a Siamese network for smart gating, and feed them to BoosterNet to improve generalization. We evaluate the performance of BoosterNet in two distinct classification problems: digit recognition and skin lesion classification. Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement in model generalization to out-of-distribution test domains compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
