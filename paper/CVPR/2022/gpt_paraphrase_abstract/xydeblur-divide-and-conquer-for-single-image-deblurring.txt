Many CNNs for single image deblurring use a U-Net structure to estimate sharp images. However, this architecture overlooks the complex blur kernels that cause blurry images. To address this, we propose a one-encoder-two-decoder architecture that incorporates complemental sub-solution learning. By utilizing multiple decoders, we can decompose the encoded feature information into directional components, improving both network efficiency and deblurring performance. Additionally, we enhance the network by rotating and sharing kernels among the decoders to prevent unnecessary component separation. Our proposed network outperforms the U-Net while preserving network parameters, and using it as a base network can enhance the performance of existing deblurring networks.
