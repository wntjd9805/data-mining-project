This paper explores a broad image recognition scenario where both labelled and unlabelled images are given, and the objective is to categorize all the unlabelled images. Existing recognition methods are not suitable for this scenario because they assume restrictive conditions, such as unlabelled instances belonging to known or unknown classes, and the number of unknown classes being known in advance. To address this unconstrained scenario, called 'Generalized Category Discovery', the paper establishes strong baselines by adapting state-of-the-art algorithms for novel category discovery. Additionally, the paper proposes the use of vision transformers with contrastive representation learning for this open-world setting. A semi-supervised k-means method is introduced to automatically cluster the unlabelled data into seen and unseen classes, outperforming the baselines. Furthermore, a new approach is suggested to estimate the number of classes in the unlabelled data. The proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated on public datasets for generic object classification and fine-grained datasets, including the Semantic Shift Benchmark suite.
