Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has made significant progress through the use of adversarial learning. However, existing methods often fail to effectively utilize discriminative information, leading to mode collapse in the generator. In this study, we propose a discriminator-free adversarial learning network (DALN) that addresses this issue by repurposing the category classifier as a discriminator. This approach achieves domain alignment and category distinguishment through a unified objective, allowing DALN to leverage predicted discriminative information for feature alignment. We introduce a Nuclear-norm Wasserstein discrepancy (NWD) as a discriminative component that satisfies the K-Lipschitz constraint without the need for weight clipping or gradient penalty strategies. DALN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various public datasets without any additional complexities. Furthermore, NWD can be used as a regularizer in existing UDA algorithms.
