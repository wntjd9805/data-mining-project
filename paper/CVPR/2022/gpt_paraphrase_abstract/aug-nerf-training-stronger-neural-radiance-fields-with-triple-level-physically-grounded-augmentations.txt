Augmented NeRF (Aug-NeRF) is proposed as an improvement to the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) method, which uses neural parameterization to render multi-view images with ground-truth supervision. NeRF often produces inconsistent and visually non-smooth results when interpolating novel views, indicating a generalization gap between seen and unseen views. Recent advancements in convolutional neural networks have shown the potential of robust data augmentations in improving generalization. Inspired by this, Aug-NeRF incorporates robust data augmentations into the NeRF training process. This is achieved by blending worst-case perturbations into three levels of the NeRF pipeline: the input coordinates, intermediate features, and pre-rendering output. These augmentations simulate imprecise camera parameters, smoothen the intrinsic feature manifold, and account for potential degradation factors in the multi-view image supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that Aug-NeRF effectively enhances NeRF performance in novel view synthesis and geometry reconstruction. Additionally, the implicit smooth prior injected by the triple-level augmentations allows Aug-NeRF to recover scenes from heavily corrupted images, a challenging scenario not addressed previously.
