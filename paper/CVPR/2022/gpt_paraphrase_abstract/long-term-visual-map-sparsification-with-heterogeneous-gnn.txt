This study focuses on the problem of map sparsification for long-term visual localization. Traditionally, the assumption has been that the pre-built map and the localization query are consistent, but this assumption is easily violated in a dynamic environment. Moreover, as new data is accumulated over time, the map size increases, resulting in significant data overhead in the long run. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model Structure from Motion (SfM) maps as heterogeneous graphs and predict the importance scores of 3D points. This allows for the exploitation of rich information in the SfM map graph. The approach introduces two new supervisions: 1) a data-fitting term that selects valuable points for future localization based on training queries, and 2) a K-Cover term that selects sparse points with complete map coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively selects map points on stable and visible structures, leading to improved localization performance compared to baseline methods.
