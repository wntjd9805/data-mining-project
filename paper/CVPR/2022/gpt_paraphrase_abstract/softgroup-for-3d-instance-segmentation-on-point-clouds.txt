This paper introduces a new approach for 3D instance segmentation called SoftGroup. Unlike existing methods that use hard predictions for semantic segmentation, SoftGroup utilizes soft grouping to address issues such as low overlaps with ground truth and false positives. By allowing each point to be associated with multiple classes and learning to categorize false positives as background, SoftGroup achieves improved performance compared to previous methods. Experimental results on various datasets confirm the effectiveness of SoftGroup, with a significant margin of improvement in terms of AP50. Additionally, SoftGroup is computationally efficient, running at a speed of 345ms per scan. The source code and trained models for both datasets are available on GitHub at https://github.com/thangvubk/SoftGroup.git.
