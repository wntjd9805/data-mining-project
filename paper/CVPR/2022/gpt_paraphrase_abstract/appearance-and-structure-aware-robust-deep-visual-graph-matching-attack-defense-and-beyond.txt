Deep graph matching (GM) models have shown high accuracy in matching visual images. However, the robustness of these models has not been extensively studied, despite its importance in various applications. This study aims to address this issue by investigating the impact of adversarial attacks on keypoint localities and hidden graphs, which can significantly reduce the accuracy of deep GM models. To overcome this vulnerability, the authors propose a defense strategy called Appearance and Structure Aware RobustGraph Matching (ASAR-GM). Unlike traditional adversarial training (AT), ASAR-GM incorporates the Appearance Aware Regularizer (AAR), which focuses on appearance-similar keypoints that are prone to confusion. Experimental results demonstrate that ASAR-GM outperforms AT in terms of robustness. Additionally, the authors found that their locality attack technique can be used as a data augmentation method, improving the performance of state-of-the-art GM models even on clean test datasets. The code for ASAR-GM is available at https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/RobustMatch.
