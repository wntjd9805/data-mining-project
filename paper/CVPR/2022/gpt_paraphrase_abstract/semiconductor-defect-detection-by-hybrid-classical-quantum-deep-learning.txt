The increasing demand for semiconductors due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology is expected to lead to a significant rise in production. However, this expansion and the introduction of new technologies also bring about the production of defective wafers. If these defect wafers are not properly inspected, the ineffective processing of semiconductors on these wafers can have negative environmental consequences, such as increased carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption. In this study, we propose a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm that utilizes the advantages of quantum computing for defect learning and review (DLDR). Our framework involves tuning parameters on a quantum circuit to facilitate deep learning tasks, including defect map classification, defect pattern classification, and hotspot detection. Additionally, we explore different parametrized quantum circuits with varying expressibility and entangling capacities. These findings can serve as a foundation for the future development of circuit-based quantum deep learning in semiconductor defect detection.
