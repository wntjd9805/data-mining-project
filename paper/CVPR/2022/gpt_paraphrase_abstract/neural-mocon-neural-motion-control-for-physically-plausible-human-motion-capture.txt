This study addresses the limitations of kinematic formulations in monocular human motion capture, which often result in physically incorrect and biomechanically implausible reconstructions. The researchers propose a method that incorporates dynamical constraints using a high-precision and non-differentiable physics simulator. The key idea is to train a target pose distribution prior using real physical supervisions, enabling sampling-based motion control to capture physically plausible human motion. To ensure accurate reference motion with terrain interactions, an interaction constraint based on Signed Distance Field (SDF) is introduced to model appropriate ground contact. A novel two-branch decoder is designed to avoid stochastic errors from pseudo ground-truth, and a distribution prior is trained using the non-differentiable physics simulator. The sampling distribution is then regressed from the current state of the physical character using the trained prior, and satisfied target poses are sampled to track the estimated reference motion. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the ability to obtain physically plausible human motion with complex terrain interactions, variations in human shape, and diverse behaviors.
