This paper introduces a motion data augmentation approach that combines motion synthesis techniques to encourage diversity and ensure physical plausibility. The motion synthesis involves a modified Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Inverse Kinematics (IK). The VAE incorporates a sampling-near-samples method that generates a range of valid motions, even when training motion data is limited. The IK-based motion synthesis enables the semi-automatic generation of diverse motions. However, these synthesis methods can introduce unrealistic artifacts into the synthesized motions. To address this, a motion correction scheme is implemented, which involves imitation learning with physics simulation and subsequent motion debiasing. The imitation learning process is accelerated through the use of the PD-residual force. The motion debiasing effectively offsets the bias introduced by imitation learning, maximizing the augmentation effect. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms previous noise-based motion augmentation methods in predicting human motion using Recurrent Neural Network-based and Graph Convolutional Network-based models.
