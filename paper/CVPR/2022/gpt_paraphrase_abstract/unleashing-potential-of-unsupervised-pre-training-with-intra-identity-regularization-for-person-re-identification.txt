This paper proposes a novel Unsupervised Pre-training framework for re-identification (UP-ReID) based on contrastive learning (CL) pipeline. Current person re-identification (ReID) methods typically initialize using pre-trained ImageNet weights, which results in a large domain gap between ImageNet classification and ReID. To address this issue, the authors introduce two critical enhancements in UP-ReID. First, they address the problem of augmentation in the CL pipeline distorting discriminative clues in person images by enforcing a global consistency constraint between augmented and original images. Second, they fully explore the local discriminative clues by employing an intrinsic contrastive constraint among local patches of each image. Extensive experiments on popular Re-ID datasets demonstrate that the UP-ReID pre-trained model significantly improves downstream ReID fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
