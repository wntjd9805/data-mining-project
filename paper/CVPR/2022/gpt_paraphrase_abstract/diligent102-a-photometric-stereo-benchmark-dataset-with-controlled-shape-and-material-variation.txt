Assessing the effectiveness of photometric stereo with real-world datasets is crucial but challenging. Current datasets are inadequate due to their limited size and random distribution of shapes and materials. This study introduces a new real-world photometric stereo dataset that is ten times larger than the commonly used dataset. Additionally, we propose a method to control variations in shape and material by fabricating objects from CAD models with carefully selected materials, encompassing key aspects of reflectance properties necessary for evaluating photometric stereo methods. By evaluating recent photometric stereo techniques using these 100 sets of images, particularly focusing on learning-based approaches, we create a 10x10 matrix illustrating the distribution of shape-material errors, providing a comprehensive overview of each evaluated method. Through this extensive analysis, we identify unresolved challenges in the field. To encourage further research, this dataset is made publicly available at https://photometricstereo.github.io.
