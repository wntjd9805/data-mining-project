We introduce Gradient-SDF, a new way to represent 3D geometry that combines the benefits of implicit and explicit representations. By storing both the signed distance field and its gradient vector field at each voxel, we enhance the capabilities of implicit representations using techniques originally designed for explicit surfaces. We demonstrate that Gradient-SDF allows for efficient SDF tracking from depth images using hash maps and enables photometric bundle adjustment directly in a voxel representation, eliminating the need for point cloud or mesh transformations. This approach optimizes geometry and camera poses implicitly and facilitates easy geometry upsampling, resulting in significantly sharper reconstructions. Additionally, the proposed Gradient-SDF maintains compatibility with parallelization methods, including GPU-based approaches, due to its adherence to the overall SDF voxel structure.
