Recent advancements in using neural implicit functions for learning 3D shapes have made significant progress in overcoming previous limitations in resolution and diversity for different topologies. However, these approaches are mostly restricted to closed surfaces, requiring the division of space into inside and outside. More recent techniques based on unsigned distance functions have been proposed to handle complex geometries containing both open and closed surfaces. However, obtaining high-quality meshes from the point cloud outputs of these methods remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a new learnable implicit representation called three-pole signed distance function (3PSDF), which can represent non-watertight 3D shapes with arbitrary topologies and easily convert them into meshes using the Marching Cubes algorithm. The key innovation of our approach is the inclusion of a new sign, the NULL sign, in addition to the conventional in and out labels. The presence of the NULL sign prevents the formation of closed isosurfaces derived from the bisector of the in/out regions. Furthermore, we propose a dedicated learning framework that effectively learns 3PSDF without concerns about the vanishing gradient caused by the null labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks both quantitatively and qualitatively.
