This paper addresses the challenge of object rotation in weakly supervised object detection from aerial images. Existing methods built on regular CNNs struggle with object rotations, leading to rotation-sensitive object detectors. Additionally, these methods often overlook lower-scored instances, resulting in unstable detectors. To tackle these issues, the authors propose a novel end-to-end weakly supervised Rotation-Invariant aerial object detection Network (RINet). RINet incorporates a multi-branch online detector refinement to improve rotation perception. It propagates labels from predicted instances to their rotated counterparts in a progressive refinement manner. The authors also introduce rotation-consistent supervision by coupling predicted instance labels across different branches, allowing for consistent and complementary feature learning without the need for additional annotations or hyper-parameters. Experimental results on the NWPU VHR-10.v2 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that RINet significantly improves the performance of existing weakly supervised object detection methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art.
