This study presents a new approach to enhance the ability of CNN-based face forgery detectors to generalize. The proposed method focuses on identifying anomalies in forged faces caused by blending operations commonly used in face forgery algorithms. The method includes a weakly supervised learning module called Second Order Local Anomaly (SOLA) that identifies anomalies in local regions using deep feature maps. SOLA decomposes the neighborhood of local features in different directions and distances to calculate first and second order local anomaly maps, which provide more comprehensive forgery traces for the classifier. Additionally, a Local Enhancement Module (LEM) is proposed to improve discrimination between local features of real and forged regions, ensuring accurate anomaly calculation. An improved Adaptive Spatial Rich Model (ASRM) is also introduced to detect subtle noise features using learnable high pass filters. Remarkably, our method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art works without requiring pixel level annotations or external synthetic data. By employing a simple ResNet18 backbone, the proposed method demonstrates promising results when evaluated on unseen forgeries.
