Semi-supervised learning (SSL) in medical image analysis (MIA) faces two challenges: effectively handling both multi-class and multi-label problems, and addressing imbalanced learning due to varying disease prevalence. While the pseudo labelling strategy is commonly used in SSL MIA, it has limitations such as lower accuracy compared to consistency learning, lack of specificity for multi-class and multi-label problems, and vulnerability to imbalanced learning. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a new SSL algorithm called anti-curriculum pseudo-labelling (ACPL). ACPL introduces novel techniques to select informative unlabelled samples, improves training balance, and enables the model to handle both multi-label and multi-class problems. Additionally, ACPL enhances the accuracy of pseudo labels by using an accurate ensemble of classifiers. We conducted extensive experiments on two public medical image classification benchmarks: Chest X-Ray14 for thorax disease multi-label classification and ISIC2018 for skin lesion multi-class classification. Our method, ACPL, outperformed previous state-of-the-art SSL methods on both datasets.
