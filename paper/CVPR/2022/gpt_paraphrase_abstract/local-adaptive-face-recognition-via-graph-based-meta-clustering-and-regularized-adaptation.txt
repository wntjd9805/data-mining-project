Due to growing concerns about data privacy, it is reasonable to assume that local client data cannot be transferred to a centralized server and their associated identity labels cannot be provided. To address this issue and enhance the quality of face recognition, we present a new problem setup called "local-adaptive face recognition (LaFR)". LaFR aims to achieve optimal performance by automatically training locally-adapted models using environment-specific data, instead of relying on a fixed global model. We propose a novel embedding cluster model based on Graph Convolution Network (GCN) and train it using a meta-optimization procedure. Our meta-clustering model demonstrates good generalization in unseen local environments. We also introduce new regularization techniques, utilizing pseudo identity labels from the clustering results, to improve model adaptation performance. Extensive experiments on racial and internal sensor adaptation confirm the effectiveness of our approach in adapting face recognition models to specific environments. Additionally, we demonstrate that LaFR can further enhance the global model through a simple federated aggregation of the updated local models.
