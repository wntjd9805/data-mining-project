We present a convolutional neural network (CNN) that utilizes the depth-from-focus (DFF) technique to estimate depth from a camera's focus change. Our network introduces a deep differential focus volume (DFV) which captures both focus and context information by computing the first-order derivative with stacked features over different focal distances. Additionally, we propose a probability regression mechanism to handle sparsely sampled focal stacks and provide uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments, our model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, showcasing its generalizability and fast processing speed.
