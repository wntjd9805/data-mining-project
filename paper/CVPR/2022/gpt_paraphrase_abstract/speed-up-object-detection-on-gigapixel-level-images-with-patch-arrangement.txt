Efficient object detection on super high-resolution images, such as gigapixel-level, is crucial but challenging. Existing approaches focus on detecting objects independently in local patches, which becomes time-consuming as the image resolution increases. In contrast, we propose a novel framework called Patch Arrangement Network (PAN) to accelerate object detection on gigapixel-level images. PAN consists of two modules: Patch Filter Module (PFM) and Patch Packing Module (PPM). PFM filters patch candidates by selecting patches at different granularities. Then, PPM determines how to pack the remaining patches into a smaller number of canvases, while generating an optimal patch layout. These canvases are then fed into the detector to obtain final results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves inference speed by 5Ã— on gigapixel-level images without sacrificing performance.
