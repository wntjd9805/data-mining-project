We have developed a method to conceal the content of input images in order to address privacy concerns. Our approach involves training visual descriptors that prevent image reconstruction while still maintaining accuracy in matching. To achieve this, we propose an adversarial learning framework where a feature encoding network and an image reconstruction network compete against each other. The feature encoder generates descriptors that impede image reconstruction, while the reconstructor tries to recover the input image from these descriptors. Our experimental results show that our method significantly reduces the quality of image reconstruction while having minimal impact on matching and camera localization performance. Overall, our approach effectively conceals image content while preserving the functionality of visual descriptors.
