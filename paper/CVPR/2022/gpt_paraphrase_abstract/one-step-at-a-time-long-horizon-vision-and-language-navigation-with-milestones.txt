We investigate the problem of creating independent agents that can understand and execute a series of actions based on human instructions in order to accomplish a given task. While there has been considerable advancement in recent years, particularly for tasks with short time frames, challenges arise when dealing with tasks that require a longer sequence of actions. In such instances, agents may overlook certain instructions or become stuck in the middle of complex instructions, ultimately resulting in task failure. To tackle this issue, we propose a model-agnostic approach called M-TRACK (milestone-based task tracker) that serves as a guide for the agent and monitors its progress. M-TRACK consists of two components: a milestone builder that tags instructions with navigation and interaction milestones that the agent must complete step by step, and a milestone checker that systematically evaluates the agent's progress within the current milestone and determines when to proceed to the next one. Through experiments conducted on the challenging ALFRED dataset, our M-TRACK approach demonstrates a significant 33% and 52% relative improvement in unseen success rate compared to two competing base models.
