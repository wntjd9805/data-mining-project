This paper introduces HyperDet3D, a method that leverages scene-conditioned prior knowledge for 3D object detection. Unlike existing methods that focus on local elements and their relations, HyperDet3D simultaneously learns scene-agnostic embeddings and scene-specific knowledge using hypernetworks. It explores abstracts from various 3D scenes and adapts the detector to the given scene during testing. The paper proposes a Multi-head Scene-specific Attention (MSA) module to dynamically control the layer parameters of the detector based on the fusion of scene-conditioned knowledge. HyperDet3D achieves state-of-the-art results on the 3D object detection benchmark of the ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets. Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluation demonstrates that the scene-conditioned prior knowledge remains effective even when faced with 3D scenes from different domains.
