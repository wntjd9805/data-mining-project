We present AiD Regen, an innovative system that combines 2D semantic segmentation with 3D reconstruction to generate 3D models of wounds. These models can be printed using 3D bio-printers for surgical treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). AiD Regen integrates various stages of the process, including RGB-D image capture, semantic segmentation, point-cloud processing, 3D model reconstruction, and G-code generation, into a single system that is ready for immediate use. To address the challenges posed by small and unbalanced DFU image datasets, we developed a multi-stage data preprocessing method. AiD Regen includes a human-in-the-loop machine learning interface that allows clinicians to easily create 3D regenerative patches and customize wound boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing wound segmentation models, and our reconstruction algorithm accurately generates 3D wound models. Additionally, we conducted a case study on a real DFU patient to showcase the effectiveness of AiD Regen in treating DFU wounds.
