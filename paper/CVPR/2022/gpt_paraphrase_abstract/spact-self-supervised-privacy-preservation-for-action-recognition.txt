Visual privacy leakage is a growing concern in video understanding applications like activity recognition. Current approaches to address this issue require privacy labels, which are not practical to annotate for video datasets. However, self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a promising technique for utilizing unlabeled data. In this study, we propose a novel training framework that removes privacy information from input videos in a self-supervised manner, without the need for privacy labels. Our framework consists of an anonymization function, a self-supervised privacy removal branch, and an action recognition branch. We train the framework using a minimax optimization strategy to minimize the action recognition cost function and maximize the privacy cost function through a contrastive self-supervised loss. By leveraging known-action and privacy attributes, our framework achieves a competitive trade-off between action recognition and privacy preservation compared to existing supervised methods. Additionally, we introduce a new protocol to evaluate the generalization of the anonymization function to novel-action and privacy attributes, demonstrating the superiority of our self-supervised framework over existing supervised methods. The code for our framework is available at: [GitHub link].
