We propose a new LiDAR-based framework called Panoptic-PHNet that addresses the challenges of panoptic segmentation in terms of speed and accuracy. Our framework has three key features:   1) We introduce a clustering pseudo heatmap combined with a center grouping module to efficiently cluster instances without requiring object-level learning tasks.  2) We propose a knn-transformer module to accurately model the interaction among foreground points for offset regression.  3) For backbone design, we fuse fine-grained voxel features and 2D Bird's Eye View (BEV) features with different receptive fields to utilize both detailed and global information.   Through extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets, we demonstrate that Panoptic-PHNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin while maintaining real-time speed. Our framework achieves the 1st place on the public leaderboard of SemanticKITTI and demonstrates leading performance on the recently released leaderboard of nuScenes.
