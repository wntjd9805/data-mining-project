Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SS-OD) techniques have been developed to improve object detectors using a limited amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, two challenges remain unaddressed: (1) no prior SS-OD work has been done on anchor-free detectors, and (2) previous methods are ineffective when it comes to pseudo-labeling bounding box regression. In this paper, we propose Unbiased Teacher v2, which extends the SS-OD method to anchor-free detectors and introduces the Listen2Student mechanism for unsupervised regression loss. We conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of existing SS-OD methods on anchor-free detectors and found that they perform poorly under the semi-supervised setting. We also observed that the box selection with centerness and localization-based labeling used in anchor-free detectors does not work well in the semi-supervised setting. On the other hand, our Listen2Student mechanism prevents misleading pseudo-labels in the training of bounding box regression. We developed a novel pseudo-labeling selection mechanism based on the relative uncertainties of the Teacher and Student, which leads to significant improvements in the regression branch under the semi-supervised setting. Our method, which applies to both anchor-free and anchor-based methods, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in VOC, COCO-standard, and COCO-additional datasets.
