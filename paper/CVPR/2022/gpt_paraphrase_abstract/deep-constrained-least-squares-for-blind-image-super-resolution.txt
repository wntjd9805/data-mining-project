In this paper, we address the problem of blind image super-resolution (SR) by introducing a new degradation model and two innovative modules. Similar to existing blind SR approaches, our method focuses on improving both kernel estimation and high-resolution image restoration based on the kernel. Specifically, we reframe the degradation model to estimate the deblurring kernel in the low-resolution space. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic deep linear filter module that can adaptively generate deblurring kernel weights based on the input, leading to more robust kernel estimation. We then apply a deep constrained least square filtering module to generate clean features using the reformulation and estimated kernel. These deblurred features, along with the low-resolution input image features, are fed into a dual-path structured SR network to restore the final high-resolution result. We evaluate our method on various benchmarks, including Gaussian8 and DIV2KRK, and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and visual improvements.
