This study introduces 3DeformRS, a method for certifying the robustness of point cloud Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against real-world deformations. The method builds upon recent work on Randomized Smoothing (RS) and specializes it to certify DNNs against parameterized deformations while maintaining practical computational costs. The authors conduct an empirical study using 3DeformRS to assess the certified robustness of four point cloud DNNs on two datasets and against seven different deformations. Compared to previous approaches, 3DeformRS is fast, scales well with point cloud size, and provides comparable or better certificates. For example, when certifying a plain PointNet against a 3-degree rotation on 1024-point clouds, 3DeformRS produces a certificate that is 3 times larger and 20 times faster than previous work.
