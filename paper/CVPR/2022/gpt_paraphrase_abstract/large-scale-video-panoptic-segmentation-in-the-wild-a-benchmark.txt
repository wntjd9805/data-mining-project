This paper introduces a new dataset called VIPSeg for the video panoptic segmentation task, which involves assigning semantic classes and tracking identities to all pixels in a video. Existing datasets for this task have been limited in terms of scale and scene diversity, making annotation challenging. In contrast, the VIPSeg dataset is large-scale and covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and categories, with 3,536 videos and 84,750 frames. It is the first attempt to address the challenging task of video panoptic segmentation in diverse scenarios. The paper evaluates existing approaches and proposes a clip-based baseline method using the VIPSeg dataset. The dataset is available at https://github.com/VIPSeg-Dataset/VIPSeg-Dataset/.
