This paper presents a novel task called human instance matting (HIM), which involves predicting precise alpha mattes for each individual human instance. Existing techniques such as instance segmentation, soft segmentation, and human/conventional matting are insufficient for complex cases where multiple instances have intertwined colors along thin and hairy boundaries. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a framework called Inst-Matt, which utilizes a mutual guidance strategy and a multi-instance refinement module to accurately delineate the relationships among overlapping human instances. Additionally, a new metric called instance matting quality (IMQ) is introduced to evaluate both instance recognition and matting quality. The paper also provides a benchmark for HIM evaluation, consisting of synthetic and natural images. The paper concludes with experimental results on complex cases and preliminary results on general instance matting. The code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/nowsyn/InstMatt.
