This paper introduces a new approach called Structured Sparse R-CNN for scene graph generation (SGG), which involves detecting object pairs with their relationships in an image. Unlike existing methods that use multi-stage pipelines, this framework directly predicts the set of object pairs and their relations. The approach utilizes learnable triplet queries and a structured triplet detector that can be optimized in an end-to-end manner. The triplet queries encode prior knowledge about object pairs and provide an initial estimation of scene graphs for further refinement. The triplet detector employs a cascaded architecture with dynamic heads to progressively improve the detected scene graphs. To address training difficulties, a relaxed and enhanced training strategy is proposed based on knowledge distillation from a Siamese Sparse R-CNN. Extensive experiments on Visual Genome and Open Images V4/V6 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies are also conducted to provide insights into the structured modeling in triplet detector design and training strategies. The code and models for this approach are available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/Structured-Sparse-RCNN.
