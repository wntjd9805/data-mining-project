Dynamic Sparse R-CNN is an improved version of Sparse R-CNN, a strong object detection method that uses sparse, learnable proposal boxes and features. The first improvement is in the label assignment scheme. Sparse R-CNN assigns only one positive sample for each ground truth using the Hungarian algorithm, which may not be optimal for matching the learned proposal boxes with the ground truths. To address this, we propose dynamic label assignment (DLA) based on the optimal transport algorithm. DLA assigns increasing positive samples in the iterative training stages of Sparse R-CNN, gradually loosening the matching constraints as the later stages produce refined proposals with improved precision.  The second improvement is in the inference process of Sparse R-CNN. Currently, the learned proposal boxes and features remain fixed for different images. Inspired by dynamic convolution, we propose dynamic proposal generation (DPG) to assemble multiple proposal experts dynamically. DPG provides better initial proposal boxes and features for the consecutive training stages. It derives sample-dependent proposal boxes and features for inference.  Experiments show that Dynamic Sparse R-CNN outperforms Sparse R-CNN with different backbones in object detection. Specifically, Dynamic Sparse R-CNN achieves a state-of-the-art average precision (AP) of 47.2% on the COCO 2017 validation set, surpassing Sparse R-CNN by 2.2% AP with the same ResNet-50 backbone.
