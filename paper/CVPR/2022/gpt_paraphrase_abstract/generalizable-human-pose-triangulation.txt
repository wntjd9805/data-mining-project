We investigate the issue of generalizing multi-view 3D human pose estimation. The current method involves detecting 2D keypoints in images and then using triangulation with multiple views. While these approaches achieve high accuracy on established benchmarks, they are limited to specific camera arrangements. Some methods attempt to address this limitation but perform poorly on new views. To overcome this, we propose a stochastic framework for human pose triangulation that exhibits superior generalization across different camera arrangements. We validate our approach on two public datasets. Additionally, we apply the same framework to the problem of fundamental matrix estimation in computer vision and observe successful results. Our stochastic framework outperforms the state-of-the-art by more than 8.8% in 3D pose estimation and improves fundamental matrix estimation by over 30% compared to a standard algorithm.
