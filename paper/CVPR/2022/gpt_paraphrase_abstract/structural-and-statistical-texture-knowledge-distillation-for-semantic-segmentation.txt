Current knowledge distillation techniques for semantic segmentation focus on transferring high-level contextual knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. However, low-level texture knowledge, which is crucial for understanding local structural patterns and global statistical properties like boundaries, smoothness, regularity, and color contrast, is often overlooked by these methods. In this study, we propose a novel approach called Structural and Statistical Texture Knowledge Distillation (SSTKD) for Semantic Segmentation that leverages both structural and statistical texture knowledge. To capture structural texture knowledge, we introduce a Contourlet Decomposition Module (CDM) that decomposes low-level features using an iterative laplacian pyramid and directional filter bank. This allows us to mine the structural texture information effectively. On the other hand, for statistical knowledge, we propose a Denoised Texture Intensity Equalization Module (DTIEM) that adaptively extracts and enhances statistical texture knowledge through heuristics iterative quantization and denoised operations. Each type of texture knowledge learning is supervised by an individual loss function, ensuring that the student network better mimics the teacher network from a broader perspective. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cityscapes, Pascal VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets. Figure 1 illustrates the overview of our approach, showing how the original fuzzy and low-contrast structural and statistical textures are enhanced and improved after the distillation process.
