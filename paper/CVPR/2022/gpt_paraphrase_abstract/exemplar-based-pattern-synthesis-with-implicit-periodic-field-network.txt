This paper proposes a framework called Implicit Periodic Field Network (IPFN) for generating visual patterns. The goal is to create scalable, diverse, and authentic patterns that can be used in texturing, shape modeling, and digital content creation. The IPFN is an exemplar-based approach that models the inner statistics of visual patterns and generates new patterns. It utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) and periodic encoding to map input coordinates to features, allowing for synthesis of patterns of any size and efficient 3D shape synthesis. The periodic encoding scheme promotes diversity by constraining the network to model the exemplar's inner statistics based on spatial latent codes in a periodic field. With the use of GAN training procedures, IPFN can generate tileable patterns with smooth transitions and local variations. Additionally, the adversarial training technique and the encoded Fourier features enable IPFN to learn high-frequency functions that produce authentic and high-quality results. The effectiveness of IPFN is demonstrated through experimental results in 2D texture synthesis and 3D shape synthesis.
