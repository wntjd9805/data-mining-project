We introduce FaceVerse, a detailed 3D Neural FaceModel created from a combination of East Asian face datasets containing 60K fused RGB-D images and 2K high-resolution 3D head scan models. Our approach utilizes a unique coarse-to-fine structure to effectively utilize this hybrid dataset. In the coarse module, we generate a base parametric model using a large-scale RGB-D image dataset, enabling accurate estimation of rough 3D face models across various genders and ages. The fine module employs a conditional StyleGAN architecture trained with high-fidelity scan models to enhance intricate facial geometric and texture details. Notably, both our base and detailed modules are adjustable, allowing for innovative applications such as modifying basic attributes and facial details of 3D face models. Additionally, we propose a single-image fitting framework based on differentiable rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing techniques in performance.
