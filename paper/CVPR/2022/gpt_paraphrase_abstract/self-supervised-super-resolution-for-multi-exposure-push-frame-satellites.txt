We propose a super-resolution method for multi-exposure sequences captured by Earth observation satellites. This problem has not been extensively studied in the literature. Our method can effectively handle signal-dependent noise, process sequences of any length, and handle inaccuracies in exposure times. It can be trained end-to-end without relying on ground truth high resolution frames, making it suitable for real data. Our method includes three key contributions: base-detail decomposition to handle errors in exposure times, noise-level-aware feature encoding for improved fusion of frames with varying signal-to-noise ratio, and a permutation invariant fusion strategy using temporal pooling operators. We conducted evaluations on both synthetic and real data, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms existing single-exposure approaches adapted for multi-exposure scenarios.
