3D semantic segmentation is a crucial component for various applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and AR/VR. However, existing state-of-the-art models often misclassify parts of the same object. Previous approaches have used hierarchical, iterative methods to combine semantic and instance information, but they lack learnability in context fusion and are computationally complex and heuristic-driven. This paper introduces Segment-Fusion, a new attention-based method for hierarchically fusing semantic and instance information to address part misclassifications. The proposed method employs a graph segmentation algorithm to group points into segments, pooling point-wise features into segment-wise features. It also utilizes a learnable attention-based network to fuse these segments based on their semantic and instance features. Finally, a simple and effective connected component labeling algorithm is used to convert segment features into instance labels. Segment-Fusion can be applied with any network architecture for semantic/instance segmentation. Experimental results on the ScanNet and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that Segment-Fusion improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of various semantic segmentation models by up to 5%.
