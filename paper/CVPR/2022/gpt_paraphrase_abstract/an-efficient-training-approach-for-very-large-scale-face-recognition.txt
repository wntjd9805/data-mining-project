In the era of deep learning, face recognition has made significant advancements thanks to large and well-labeled datasets. However, training on these datasets is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Therefore, it is crucial to develop an efficient training approach. The high computational and memory costs are mainly due to the large dimensionality of the fully connected (FC) layer. To address this issue, we propose a new training approach called Faster Face Classification (F2C) that reduces time and cost without compromising performance. F2C utilizes a Dynamic Class Pool (DCP) to store and update features of identities dynamically, serving as a replacement for the FC layer. DCP is efficient in terms of time and cost as it has a smaller size and is independent of the entire face identities. We validate the effectiveness of F2C on various face benchmarks and private datasets, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art FC-based methods while being faster in terms of recognition accuracy and hardware costs. Additionally, we enhance our method with a well-designed dual data loader that includes identity-based and instance-based loaders, further improving the efficiency of updating DCP parameters.
