The size and shape of the receptive field have a significant impact on the overall performance of a neural network. Existing models rely on hyperparameters to determine the receptive field, resulting in suboptimal shapes and sizes. To address this issue, we propose a new operation called DynOPool, which learns the optimized scale factors of feature maps. This allows for the determination of the proper resolution and shape of a feature map's receptive field, improving the operator's ability to observe input images at the optimal scale. DynOPool can replace resizing modules in a deep neural network with minimal cost. Additionally, DynOPool introduces an additional loss term to control the complexity of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that models equipped with DynOPool outperform baseline algorithms in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks on multiple datasets.
