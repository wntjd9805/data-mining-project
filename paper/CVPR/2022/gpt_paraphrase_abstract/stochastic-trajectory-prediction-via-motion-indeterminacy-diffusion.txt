This study focuses on the prediction of pedestrian trajectories, recognizing that human behavior is inherently unpredictable. Existing trajectory prediction methods use latent variables to represent the multiple possible future motion states. However, this paper introduces a new framework that explicitly simulates the transition from indeterminate to determinate motion. The proposed framework formulates trajectory prediction as a reverse process of motion indeterminacy diffusion (MID), gradually reducing uncertainty until reaching the desired trajectory. The diffusion process is learned using a parameterized Markov chain, which is conditioned by observed trajectories. By adjusting the length of the chain, the degree of indeterminacy can be controlled to balance the diversity and determinacy of predictions. The model incorporates historical behavior information and social interactions as a state embedding and utilizes a Transformer-based diffusion model to capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code for the method is available at https://github.com/gutianpei/MID.
