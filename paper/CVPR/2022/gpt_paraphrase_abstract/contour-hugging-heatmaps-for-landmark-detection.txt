We propose a method for simultaneously detecting landmarks in images and obtaining uncertainty measurements for each landmark. These measurements are particularly useful in medical imaging applications, as they allow a landmark detection system to indicate its level of confidence in its predictions. When the system is uncertain, manual intervention can be used to improve accuracy. The ability to review the system's level of certainty also enhances a clinician's trust in the system. Our method involves training a network on one-hot heatmap images, calibrating uncertainty using temperature scaling, and calculating a novel statistic called 'Expected Radial Error' for uncertainty measurements. Our method achieves localization results comparable to state-of-the-art methods and provides an uncertainty score that correlates with the true error for each landmark. This represents a significant advancement in generic computer vision methods for landmark detection. We also demonstrate that our uncertainty measurement can accurately classify inaccurate landmark predictions. The code for our method is available at the provided GitHub link.
