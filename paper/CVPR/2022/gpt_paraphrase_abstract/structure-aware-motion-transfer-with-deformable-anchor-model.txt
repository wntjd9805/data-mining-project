This paper introduces a novel approach called the deformable anchor model (DAM) for the motion transfer task. The goal of motion transfer is to generate a video that learns the motion from a driving video while preserving the appearance from a source image. The DAM approach automatically discovers the motion structure of arbitrary objects without relying on prior structure information. The DAM model consists of two types of anchors: motion anchors that capture appearance and motion information, and a latent root anchor that aids in learning the object structure. The DAM model can be extended to more complex structures by introducing additional latent anchors. By regularizing the motion anchors with latent anchors, the DAM model ensures that the structural information is well captured and preserved. Additionally, the DAM model can be learned in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the DAM approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in motion transfer.
