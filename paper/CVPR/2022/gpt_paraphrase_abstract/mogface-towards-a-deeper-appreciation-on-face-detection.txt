Significant progress has been made in face detection thanks to the design of generic object detectors. However, certain methods like label assignment and scale-level data augmentation have limitations when directly applied to face detection. These methods have a large number of hyper-parameters and suffer from scale distribution bias, hindering their generalization abilities. Additionally, false alarms need to be eliminated for accurate face bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose a novel face detector called MogFace that addresses these challenges. MogFace includes three key components: Adaptive Online Incremental Anchor Mining Strategy, Selective Scale Enhancement Strategy, and Hierarchical Context-Aware Module. Our MogFace achieves the best performance on the Wider Face leaderboard, surpassing other methods in different testing scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/damo-cv/MogFace.
