Deep learning models for single image super-resolution have been extensively researched and have achieved excellent results in improving the quality of low-resolution images with a fixed scale factor and known degradation. However, there is a growing interest in developing models that can handle arbitrary upscaling factors to enhance their real-world applicability. Our proposed method is the first to approach arbitrary rescaling, including both upscaling and downscaling, as a unified process. By jointly optimizing both directions, our model can learn to perform bidirectional arbitrary image rescaling, significantly outperforming existing models in terms of performance. Additionally, our model is capable of maintaining visual perception quality in downscaled images. We have also tested the robustness of our model in cycle idempotence, where it consistently maintains reconstruction accuracy even when the downscaling-to-upscaling cycle is repeatedly applied. This robustness is particularly advantageous for image rescaling in real-world scenarios where multiple iterations of the cycle may be required. Furthermore, our model performs well on tests with arbitrary large scales and asymmetric scales, even when it is not specifically trained for such tasks. We have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of our model.
