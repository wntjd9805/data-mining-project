This paper introduces NeuralHDHair, a system for automatically modeling high-fidelity 3D hair from a single image. Existing methods for monocular hair modeling are either difficult to use in digital systems or can only generate coarse geometry. The system utilizes two neural networks: IRHairNet for inferring 3D hair geometric features and GrowingNet for efficiently generating 3D hair strands. The approach starts with a coarse representation of the hair's global features and then adds local details using a hair luminance map. To improve efficiency, a local neural implicit function is used to grow strands based on the estimated 3D hair features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively and efficiently constructs high-fidelity 3D hair models from single images, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
