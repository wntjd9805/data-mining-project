TubeFormer-DeepLab is introduced as the first approach to address various video segmentation tasks in a unified manner. Typically, these tasks are treated as separate problems with different approaches dominating each one. However, the authors propose that video segmentation tasks can be formulated as assigning predicted labels to video tubes, which are formed by connecting segmentation masks over time. These labels can represent different values depending on the specific task. Based on this observation, TubeFormer-DeepLab is developed as a straightforward and effective model for transforming video masks. It predicts video tubes with task-specific labels, simplifying the complexity of video segmentation models. Additionally, TubeFormer-DeepLab achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple video segmentation benchmarks.
