Previous methods for trajectory prediction in the field of neuropsychology have typically used a parameter-based approach, which involves encoding all past-future instance pairs into model parameters. However, this method can lead to a large number of irrelevant instances being included in the prediction process, negatively impacting performance. In order to establish a clearer connection between the current situation and the seen instances, we propose MemoNet, an instance-based approach inspired by the concept of retrospective memory. MemoNet predicts the movement intentions of agents by searching for similar scenarios in the training data. This is achieved through the use of memory banks that store representative instances and a trainable memory addresser that searches for current situations similar to the stored instances. During prediction, MemoNet recalls relevant memories by using the memory addresser to index related instances in the memory bank. We also introduce a two-step trajectory prediction system, where the first step involves using MemoNet to predict the destination and the second step involves completing the entire trajectory based on the predicted destinations. Experimental results demonstrate that MemoNet outperforms the previous best method on SDD/ETH-UCY/NBA datasets, showing improvements in FDE by 20.3%/10.2%/28.3% respectively. Furthermore, the experiments confirm that MemoNet has the ability to trace back to specific instances during prediction, enhancing interpretability.
