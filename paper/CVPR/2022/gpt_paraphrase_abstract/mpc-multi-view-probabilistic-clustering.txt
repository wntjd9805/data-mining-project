Despite the progress made in multi-view clustering (MVC), there are still two challenges that need better solutions: 1) Existing methods for incomplete multi-view clustering are not qualified or require additional steps, and 2) Noise or outliers can greatly reduce the overall clustering performance. This paper proposes a new unified framework called multi-view probabilistic clustering (MPC) to address both incomplete and complete MVC. MPC transforms the pairwise posterior matching probability of multi-view data into each view's individual distribution, allowing for missing data and accommodating any number of views. Graph-context-aware refinement techniques, such as path propagation and co-neighbor propagation, are used to improve the pairwise probability and mitigate the impact of noise and outliers. Additionally, MPC transforms the objective of probabilistic clustering to avoid the need for complete pairwise computation and adjusts clustering assignments by maximizing joint probability iteratively. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks for incomplete and complete MVC demonstrate that MPC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
