We propose a new approach called the SSRT (semantic and spatial refined transformer) for the Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection task. This task involves localizing humans and objects and predicting their interactions. Unlike previous Transformer-based methods for HOI, the SSRT introduces two novel modules. These modules aim to improve the selection of relevant object-action pairs within an image and enhance the representation of queries using semantic and spatial features. By incorporating these enhancements, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the widely-used HOI benchmarks, V-COCO and HICO-DET.
