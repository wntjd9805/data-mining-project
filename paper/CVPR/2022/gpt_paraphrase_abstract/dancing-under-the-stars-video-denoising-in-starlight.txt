This paper presents a breakthrough in low-light imaging by demonstrating the ability to capture photorealistic videos under starlight conditions, which have illumination levels below 0.001 lux and no moonlight present. By utilizing sensitive CMOS cameras and developing a physics-based noise model tuned with a GAN, the camera noise at extremely low light levels is accurately represented. A video denoiser is then trained using a combination of simulated noisy video clips and real noisy still images. The researchers successfully capture a dataset of 5-10 fps videos with significant motion at approximately 0.6-0.7 millilux without any active illumination. Compared to alternative methods, this approach achieves improved video quality at the lowest light levels, marking the first demonstration of photorealistic video denoising in starlight conditions.
