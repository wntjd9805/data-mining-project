This paper introduces Neural Points, a new representation for point clouds that is applied to the task of arbitrary-factored upsampling. Unlike traditional point cloud representations that only capture position or local planes in 3D space, Neural Points represent each point as a local continuous geometric shape using neural fields. This allows Neural Points to contain more shape information and have a stronger representation ability. The training of Neural Points involves using surfaces with rich geometric details to ensure the model can express various shapes effectively. Deep local features are extracted from the points, and neural fields are constructed based on the local isomorphism between the 2D parametric domain and the 3D local patch. These local neural fields are then integrated to form the global surface. Experimental results demonstrate that Neural Points exhibit powerful representation ability, as well as robustness and generalization. The proposed method outperforms existing point cloud upsampling methods. The code for Neural Points is available at https://github.com/WanquanF/NeuralPoints.
