The walking pattern of the human body, known as gait, encompasses both shape and motion cues. However, current mainstream methods for recognizing gait primarily focus on the shape of the silhouette, neglecting the explicit representation of motion. This paper aims to investigate the incorporation of motion in gait sequence modeling. Through the analysis of human walking using Lagrange's equation, it is determined that second-order information in the temporal dimension is essential for accurate identification. To address this, a second-order motion extraction module is developed based on the obtained conclusions. Additionally, a lightweight view-embedding module is designed to address the issue of existing methods for cross-view tasks not explicitly considering the view itself. Experimental evaluations conducted on CASIA-B and OU-MVLP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Furthermore, visualization techniques are employed to showcase the interpretability of the extracted motion using our motion extraction module.
