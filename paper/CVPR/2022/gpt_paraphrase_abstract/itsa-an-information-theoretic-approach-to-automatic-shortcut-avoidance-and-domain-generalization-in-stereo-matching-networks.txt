Current stereo matching networks, which are trained on synthetic data, often struggle to perform well on real data. This paper aims to address one of the main reasons for this lack of generalization: shortcut learning. The authors demonstrate that the feature representations learned by stereo matching networks are heavily influenced by synthetic data artifacts, known as shortcut attributes. To overcome this issue, they propose an Information-Theoretic Shortcut Avoidance (ITSA) approach, which automatically prevents shortcut-related information from being encoded into the feature representations. By doing so, their method learns robust and shortcut-invariant features that are less sensitive to input variations. To achieve this, they propose an efficient algorithm that avoids the computational burden of directly optimizing input sensitivity. The results show that using this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks trained solely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging real data scenarios that were previously unseen. Moreover, the proposed method improves the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the extent that they outperform their fine-tuned counterparts when tested on difficult out-of-domain stereo datasets.
