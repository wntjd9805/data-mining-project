We propose a method to estimate the material properties of an object's interior based on its surface vibrations captured in a monocular video. This method allows us to determine the Young's modulus and density of the object throughout its 3D structure. By understanding how these values change across the object, we can simulate its motion and identify any defects. Unlike traditional non-destructive testing methods that often rely on expensive instruments and only estimate homogenized material properties or detect defects, our approach utilizes monocular video to (1) identify image-space modes from the object's sub-pixel motion and (2) directly infer spatially-varying Young's modulus and density values from these observed modes. We validate our approach using both simulated and real videos.
