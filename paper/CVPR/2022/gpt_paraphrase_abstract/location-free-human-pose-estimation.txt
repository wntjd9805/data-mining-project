We propose a location-free framework for human pose estimation (HPE) that does not require supervision of keypoint locations. By reformulating the regression-based HPE as a classification problem, we utilize the weakly-supervised object localization technique to acquire coarse keypoint locations. However, this approach is not satisfactory for fine-grained HPE. To address this, we introduce a customized transformer framework that incorporates a Multi-scale Spatial-guided Context Encoder to capture global human context and focus on part-aware regions, and a Relation-encoded Pose Prototype Generation module to encode structural relations. These components strengthen the weak supervision from image-level category labels on locations. Our model achieves competitive performance on three datasets with only category-level supervision and comparable results to fully-supervised methods with only 25% location labels on MS-COCO and MPII.
