The current research focuses on neural representations of static 3D shapes, but there are limited representations available for deformable surfaces that are either dependent on templates or lack efficiency. To address this, we propose a new representation called Canonical Deformation Coordinate Space (CaDeX), which combines shape and non-rigid motion. Our approach involves factorizing the deformation between frames using continuous bijective canonical maps and their inverses, which are guided by a learned canonical shape. This representation is straightforward, effective, and ensures cycle consistency, topology preservation, and potentially volume conservation. Additionally, our modeling of the learned canonical shapes offers a versatile and stable framework for shape prior learning. We validate our approach by achieving state-of-the-art results in modeling various types of deformable geometries, including human bodies, animal bodies, and articulated objects.
