Arbitrary style transfer (AST) and domain generalization (DG) are challenging tasks in visual learning. These tasks involve matching feature distributions, which has typically been done by matching the mean and standard deviation of features assuming a Gaussian distribution. However, real-world data often have more complex feature distributions that cannot be accurately matched using only first- and second-order statistics. Using high-order statistics for distribution matching is computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a new method called Exact Feature Distribution Matching (EFDM) that matches the empirical cumulative distribution functions (eCDFs) of image features. This is achieved by employing an Exact Histogram Matching (EHM) algorithm called Sort-Matching, which is fast and can be easily integrated into existing systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EFDM on various AST and DG tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/YBZh/EFDM.
