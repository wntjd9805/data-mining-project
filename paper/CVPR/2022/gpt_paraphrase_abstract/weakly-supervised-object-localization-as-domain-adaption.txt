This study introduces a new perspective on weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) by treating it as a domain adaptation (DA) task. Previous WSOL methods have relied on classification activation maps (CAM) and multi-instance learning (MIL) to localize objects, but this approach only activates discriminative object parts and fails to capture the entire object. To address this limitation, the authors propose a DA-WSOL pipeline that incorporates DA techniques to improve localization performance. The pipeline includes a target sampling strategy to select different types of target samples, a domain adaptation localization (DAL) loss that aligns feature distributions between the source and target domains, and Universum regularization to help the estimator perceive target domain cues. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks. The code for this work is available on GitHub.
