Improving the discriminators is crucial in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for better generation performance. This study investigates the biases of discriminators and explores whether debiasing them can enhance generation performance. Empirical evidence suggests that discriminators are influenced by image styles, such as texture and color. To address this issue, the authors propose a technique called feature statistics mixing regularization (FSMR) that encourages the discriminator to be invariant to image styles. FSMR involves generating a mixed feature using an original and a reference image in the discriminator's feature space and applying regularization to ensure consistent prediction for the mixed feature and the original image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FSMR reduces sensitivity to style and consistently improves the performance of various GAN architectures across nine datasets. Furthermore, integrating FSMR with augmentation-based GAN methods enhances image quality. The code for FSMR is available at https://github.com/naver-ai/FSMR.
