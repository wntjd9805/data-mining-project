The task of evaluating the quality of long-term actions in videos involves assessing different levels of skill, which we refer to as performance grades. This includes identifying technical highlights and faults within the same action. Instead of using direct regression, we propose a Likert scoring paradigm inspired by psychometrics. This paradigm quantifies the grades explicitly and combines quantitative values with corresponding responses from the video to generate a final quality score. We also utilize a Transformer decoder architecture to extract grade-specific features and estimate the responses for each grade. Our model, called Grade-decoupling Likert Transformer (GDLT), achieves state-of-the-art results on two long-term action assessment datasets. The illustration in Figure 1 demonstrates our idea, where action video features are disentangled into grade-aware features, which provide evidence for generating responses and determining the final quality score by aggregating scores from different grades. The output only provides a summary of the abstract.
