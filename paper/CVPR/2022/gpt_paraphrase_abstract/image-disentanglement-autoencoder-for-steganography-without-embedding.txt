We propose a new steganography technique called Image DisEntanglement Autoencoder for Steganography (IDEAS) that overcomes the limitations of conventional steganography approaches. Instead of embedding the secret message directly into a carrier image, IDEAS hides it by transforming it into a synthesized image. This method makes IDEAS fundamentally immune to typical steganalysis attacks. We disentangle the image into two representations: structure and texture. The stability of the structure representation improves secret message extraction, while randomizing the texture representations enhances steganography security by increasing synthesis diversity. Additionally, we design an adaptive mapping mechanism to further enhance the diversity of synthesized images, ensuring different levels of extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that IDEAS outperforms state-of-the-art steganography without embedding methods in terms of enhanced security, reliable secret message extraction, and flexibility for different extraction levels.
