In this paper, we address the problem of joint semantic, affordance, and attribute parsing in indoor scene understanding. This is a challenging task that requires capturing long-range dependency, learning from weakly aligned data, and balancing sub-tasks during training. To tackle these challenges, we propose an attention-based architecture called Cerberus and a tailored training framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks. Interestingly, our analysis shows that the concept affinity in our model is consistent with human cognition, which motivates us to explore weakly supervised learning. Surprisingly, Cerberus achieves strong results with only 0.1% - 1% annotation. Visualizations also demonstrate that the success of our method is due to common attention maps across tasks.
