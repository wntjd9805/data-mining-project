This paper examines teacher-student learning in the context of data initialization and presents a new algorithm called Active Teacher1 for semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). Active Teacher expands on the teacher-student framework by introducing an iterative approach that partially initializes the label set and gradually enhances it by evaluating three key factors of unlabeled examples: difficulty, information, and diversity. By doing so, Active Teacher maximizes the effectiveness of limited label information and improves the quality of pseudo-labels. To validate the proposed approach, extensive experiments are conducted on the MS-COCO benchmark, comparing Active Teacher with several recently proposed SSOD methods. The results not only demonstrate the superior performance of Active Teacher compared to the other methods, but also show that it allows the baseline network, Faster-RCNN, to achieve 100% supervised performance with significantly fewer labeled examples (40% on MS-COCO). Furthermore, the experimental analysis in this paper provides valuable empirical knowledge that can be applied to data annotation in practical applications.
