This paper focuses on the reconstruction of hyperspectral images (HSI) using a coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) system. The goal is to recover the 3D spatial-spectral signal from a 2D measurement. It is known that HSI representations are highly similar and correlated across the spectral dimension, so modeling the inter-spectra interactions is important for accurate reconstruction. However, current CNN-based methods have limitations in capturing spectral-wise similarity and long-range dependencies. Additionally, the HSI information is modulated by a coded aperture (physical mask) in CASSI, but existing algorithms have not fully utilized the guidance effect of the mask for HSI restoration.To address these issues, the authors propose a novel framework called Mask-guided Spectral-wise Trans-Specifically (MST) for HSI reconstruction. The framework includes a Spectral-wise Multi-head Self-Attention (S-MSA) module that treats each spectral feature as a token and calculates self-attention along the spectral dimension. This helps capture spectral-wise similarity and long-range dependencies. Furthermore, a Mask-guided Mechanism (MM) is customized to direct the S-MSA module to focus on spatial regions with high-fidelity spectral representations, leveraging the guidance of the coded aperture.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MST framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulation and real HSI datasets. Notably, it achieves superior results while requiring significantly lower computational and memory costs. The code for the proposed framework is available at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/MST/.
