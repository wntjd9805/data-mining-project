This paper addresses the issue of repairing dysfunctional 3D objects. While previous studies have focused on developing passive perception models to understand functionality based on static objects, we argue that functionality should be determined by the physical interactions between the object and the user. Humans can mentally simulate the functionality of a dysfunctional object and determine how to fix it. In light of this, we introduce FIXIT, a dataset comprising approximately 5,000 poorly-designed 3D objects paired with potential solutions for fixing them. To emulate the mental simulation process of humans, we propose FixNet, a new framework that integrates perception and physical dynamics seamlessly. FixNet consists of a perception module that extracts structured representations from the 3D point cloud, a physical dynamics prediction module that simulates the outcomes of interactions with 3D objects, and a functionality prediction module that evaluates functionality and selects the appropriate fix. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline models and exhibits strong generalization to objects with similar interaction types. The code and dataset are publicly available.
