Our objective is to obtain the 3D shape and pose of dogs using only a single image. This task is extremely challenging due to the wide variety of shapes and appearances dogs can have, as well as their highly articulated nature. Previous studies have attempted to directly regress the SMAL animal model, with the inclusion of limb scale parameters, from images. In our approach, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using Classification), we go beyond existing methods in several significant ways. Firstly, we modify the SMAL shape space to better represent dog shapes. However, even with an improved shape model, regressing dog shape from an image remains challenging due to the lack of paired images with 3D ground truth. To overcome this limitation, we propose novel losses that leverage information about dog breeds. Specifically, we exploit the fact that dogs of the same breed tend to have similar body shapes. We introduce a novel breed similarity loss, which consists of two components: one encourages dogs of the same breed to have more similar shapes than dogs of different breeds, and the other is a breed classification loss that facilitates the generation of recognizable breed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that our breed losses significantly enhance shape accuracy compared to a baseline without them. We also conduct a qualitative comparison between BARC and WLDO through a perceptual study, and find that our approach produces dogs that are noticeably more realistic. This work demonstrates that utilizing prior knowledge about genetic similarity can compensate for the lack of 3D training data. Furthermore, this concept may be applicable to other animal species or groups of species. The code for our method is publicly available for research purposes at https://barc.is.tue.mpg.de/.
