The task of reconstructing a 3D face from a single image has gained significant interest in the Computer Vision community due to its various applications. These include creating realistic 3D avatars, face recognition that accounts for different poses, and face hallucination. While there has been considerable research in this area since the introduction of the 3D Morphable Model, current 3D face models lack finer and more deformable components such as the tongue, which are crucial for creating realistic 3D avatars. In this study, we present the first end-to-end trainable pipeline that accurately reconstructs the 3D face along with the tongue. We also address the challenges of "in-the-wild" images by introducing a novel GAN method specifically designed for generating the 3D surface of the tongue. Additionally, we provide a diverse dataset of tongue scans from 700 individuals, encompassing variations in gender, age, and ethnicity backgrounds. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate that our model is robust and can realistically capture the 3D structure of the tongue even in challenging "in-the-wild" conditions.
