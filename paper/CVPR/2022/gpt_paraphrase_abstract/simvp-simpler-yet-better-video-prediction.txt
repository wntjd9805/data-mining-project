This paper introduces SimVP, a straightforward video prediction model that relies solely on CNN and is trained using MSE loss in an end-to-end manner. Unlike other advanced models, SimVP does not require additional tricks or complex strategies. Despite its simplicity, SimVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets. The authors also demonstrate through extensive experiments that SimVP exhibits strong generalization and extensibility on real-world datasets. Moreover, SimVP significantly reduces training costs, enabling its application in complex scenarios. The authors believe that SimVP can serve as a solid baseline for future advancements in video prediction.
