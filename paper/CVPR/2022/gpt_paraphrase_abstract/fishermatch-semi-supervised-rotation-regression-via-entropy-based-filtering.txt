We present a novel framework called FisherMatch for estimating 3DoF rotation from a single RGB image. Unlike previous methods that rely on expensive labeled data, we propose a semi-supervised approach that does not require domain-specific knowledge or paired data. Inspired by the semi-supervised approach, FixMatch, we use pseudo label filtering to enhance the flow of information from labeled to unlabeled data in a teacher-student mutual learning framework. However, incorporating this filtering mechanism into rotation regression is challenging due to the lack of a reliable confidence measure for rotation prediction. To address this, we utilize the matrix Fisher distribution to create a probabilistic model of rotation and develop a matrixFisher-based regressor for predicting rotation and its uncertainty. We use the entropy of the predicted distribution as a confidence measure and employ pseudo label filtering for rotation regression. To supervise the distribution-like pseudo labels, we explore methods for enforcing loss between two matrix Fisher distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that FisherMatch performs well even with limited labeled data, surpassing supervised learning and other semi-supervised learning approaches.
