We address the issue of learning object detectors without any supervision. Unlike weakly-supervised object detection methods, we do not assume image-level class labels. Instead, we utilize audio-visual data to extract a supervisory signal, using the audio component to instruct the object detector. Our approach is more challenging than sound source localization because the detector needs to classify objects by type, identify each instance of the object, and do so even when the object is silent. To overcome this challenge, we propose a self-supervised framework with a contrastive objective that simultaneously learns object classification and localization. Subsequently, we exploit these self-supervised labels and boxes to train an image-based object detector without any supervision. Our method surpasses previous unsupervised and weakly-supervised detectors in terms of object detection and sound source localization. Additionally, we demonstrate that our detector can be aligned with ground-truth classes using only one label per pseudo-class. Furthermore, our method is capable of detecting generic objects beyond instruments, such as airplanes and cats.
