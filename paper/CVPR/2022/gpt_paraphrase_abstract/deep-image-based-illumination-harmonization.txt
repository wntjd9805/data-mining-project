Integrating a foreground object into a background scene while harmonizing illumination is a challenging task in computer vision and augmented reality. Current methods focus on foreground and background consistency or foreground object shadow generation, but neglect global appearance and illumination harmonization. In this study, we address this issue by formulating seamless illumination harmonization as an illumination exchange and aggregation problem. We start by creating a dataset called IH, which includes diverse foreground objects and background scenes with different lighting conditions. Next, we propose a deep image-based illumination harmonization GAN framework called DIH-GAN. This framework utilizes a multi-scale attention mechanism and illumination exchange strategy to infer the mapping relationship between the foreground object and the background scene. Additionally, we employ adversarial learning to refine the illumination harmonization result. Our method not only achieves harmonious appearance and illumination for the foreground object but also generates realistic shadow cast by the foreground object. Extensive experiments conducted on both our IH dataset and real-world images demonstrate that our proposed DIH-GAN offers a practical and effective solution for image-based object illumination harmonization editing. Furthermore, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The IH dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/zhongyunbao/Dataset.
