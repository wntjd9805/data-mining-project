Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has gained considerable attention recently. However, due to the absence of bounding-box supervision, its accuracy is significantly lower compared to fully supervised object detection (FSOD). Moreover, modern FSOD techniques are not applicable to WSOD. This study proposes a novel framework called Salvage of Supervision (SoS) to bridge the performance and technical gaps between WSOD and FSOD. The key idea behind SoS is to leverage every potential supervisory signal in WSOD, including weak image-level labels, pseudo-labels, and the power of semi-supervised object detection. The paper introduces innovative approaches to effectively utilize these weak and noisy signals. The results demonstrate that each type of supervisory signal contributes significantly to improvements, surpassing existing WSOD methods that primarily rely on weak labels. Additionally, the proposed SoS-WSOD method can seamlessly incorporate modern FSOD techniques. SoS-WSOD achieves promising results with 64.4 mAP50 on VOC2007, 61.9 mAP50 on VOC2012, and 16.6 mAP50:95 on MS-COCO, while maintaining fast inference speed. Ablation studies and visualization further validate the efficacy of SoS.
