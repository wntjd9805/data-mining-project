This paper introduces a new method called ELSR for efficient reconstruction of three-dimensional line segments. Existing algorithms for 3D line segment reconstruction typically work with two views or small-size images, while practical scenarios often involve hundreds or thousands of large-size images. ELSR takes advantage of scene planes commonly found in city scenes and sparse 3D points obtained from the structure-from-motion approach. For two views, ELSR identifies the local scene plane to guide line matching and utilizes sparse 3D points to speed up and constrain the matching process. To reconstruct a 3D line segment with multiple views, ELSR employs an efficient abstraction technique that selects representative 3D lines based on their spatial consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that ELSR achieves higher accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. Additionally, ELSR is capable of efficiently reconstructing 3D lines for large and complex scenes containing thousands of large-size images.
