This paper introduces Multiscale Vision Transformers (MViTv2) as a unified architecture for image and video classification, as well as object detection. A new and improved version of MViT is presented, which includes decomposed relative positional embeddings and residual pooling connections. The architecture is implemented in five different sizes and evaluated for ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and Kinetics video recognition. MViTv2 outperforms previous models in these tasks. The pooling attention of MViTv2 is compared to window attention mechanisms, and it is found that MViTv2 achieves higher accuracy with less computation. Without any additional enhancements, MViTv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in three domains: 88.8% accuracy on ImageNet classification, 58.7 APbox on COCO object detection, and 86.1% on Kinetics-400 video classification. The code and models for MViTv2 are publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/mvit.
