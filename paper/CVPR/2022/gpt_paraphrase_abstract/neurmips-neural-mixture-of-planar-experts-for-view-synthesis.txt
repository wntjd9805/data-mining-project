We introduce Neural Mixtures of Planar Experts (Neur-MiPs), a new approach for representing scenes using a combination of local planar experts. These experts are responsible for capturing both the geometry and appearance of the scene. Each expert consists of parameters defining a rectangular shape for the geometry and a neural radiance field for modeling color and opacity. To generate new views, we calculate intersections between rays and planes, and then combine the colors and densities at those points to create the final image. Neur-MiPs combines the efficiency of mesh rendering with the flexibility of neural radiance fields. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other 3D representations in terms of both performance and speed in novel view synthesis.
