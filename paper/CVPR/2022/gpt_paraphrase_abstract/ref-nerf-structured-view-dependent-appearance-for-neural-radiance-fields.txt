Ref-NeRF is introduced as an enhancement to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a widely used technique for synthesizing views of a scene. While NeRF is effective at representing detailed geometric structures with varying appearance, it struggles to accurately capture the glossy surfaces. Ref-NeRF addresses this limitation by replacing NeRF's parameterization of view-dependent outgoing radiance with a representation of reflected radiance. This is achieved by structuring the function using a collection of spatially-varying scene properties. The model also incorporates a regularizer on normal vectors to further improve the realism and accuracy of specular reflections. Additionally, Ref-NeRF's internal representation of outgoing radiance is interpretable and can be used for scene editing.
