We explore a task called Insubstantial Object Detection (IOD) that involves localizing objects with specific characteristics: (1) shape with an undefined boundary, (2) similarity to the surrounding environment, and (3) lack of color. Detecting insubstantial objects in a single static frame is particularly challenging, requiring the incorporation of spatial and temporal information. To address this, we create an IOD-Video dataset consisting of 600 videos (141,017 frames) captured under different conditions, including varying distances, sizes, visibility, and scenes recorded using different spectral ranges. We also propose a spatio-temporal aggregation framework for IOD, utilizing different backbones and a carefully designed spatio-temporal aggregation loss (STAloss) to ensure consistency over time. Experimental results on the IOD-Video dataset demonstrate that spatio-temporal aggregation significantly enhances IOD performance. We hope that our work will inspire further research in this valuable yet demanding task. The source code can be found at: https://github.com/CalayZhou/IOD-Video.
