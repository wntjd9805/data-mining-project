Joint denoising and demosaicking (JDD) for burst images, known as JDD-B, has gained attention as a method for reconstructing high-quality full-color images from raw data. However, aligning the image frames is a major challenge in JDD-B due to large shifts caused by camera and object motion, especially in high-resolution devices. To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage alignment scheme for effective JDD-B. In the first stage, a differentiable progressive block matching method is used to align burst images at the patch level, providing an estimate of the offset between frames with low computational cost. In the second stage, implicit pixel-wise alignment is performed in the full-resolution feature domain to refine the alignment results. Both stages are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement compared to existing JDD-B methods. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/GuoShi28/2StageAlign.
