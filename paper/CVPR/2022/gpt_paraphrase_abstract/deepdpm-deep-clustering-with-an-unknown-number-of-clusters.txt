Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in clustering tasks, but most deep-clustering methods require a predefined number of clusters (K), which can be computationally expensive to determine. In this study, we propose a deep-clustering method that infers the optimal value of K during the learning process. Our method outperforms existing nonparametric methods and is scalable. We demonstrate the importance of inferring K by showing that fixed K values lead to performance deterioration, especially on imbalanced datasets. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/BGU-CS-VIL/DeepDPM.
