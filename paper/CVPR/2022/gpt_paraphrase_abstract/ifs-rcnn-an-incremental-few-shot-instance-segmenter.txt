This paper focuses on incremental few-shot instance segmentation, which involves dealing with a few examples of new object classes without access to training examples of old classes. The objective is to perform well on both the old and new classes. We propose two enhancements to the Mask-RCNN framework in its second stage. Firstly, we introduce a new object class classifier based on the probit function, which utilizes Bayesian learning to handle the lack of training examples for new classes. Secondly, we introduce an uncertainty-guided bounding-box predictor that not only predicts object bounding boxes but also estimates the uncertainty of the prediction to improve bounding box refinement. We also define two new loss functions based on the estimated object-class distribution and bounding-box uncertainty. Our contributions result in significant performance improvements on the COCO dataset compared to the state of the art, achieving a gain of +6 on new classes and +16 on old classes in the AP instance segmentation metric. Additionally, we are the first to evaluate the incremental few-shot setting on the more challenging LVIS dataset.
