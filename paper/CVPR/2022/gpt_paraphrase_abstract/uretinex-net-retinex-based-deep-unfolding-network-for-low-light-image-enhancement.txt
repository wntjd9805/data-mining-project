This paper introduces a novel method called URetinex-Net which improves upon existing Retinex model-based methods for enhancing low-light images. These existing methods often lack adaptivity and efficiency due to their reliance on hand-crafted priors and optimization-driven solutions. URetinex-Net addresses these issues by utilizing a deep unfolding network that decomposes low-light images into reflectance and illumination layers. This decomposition problem is formulated as an implicit priors regularized model, and three learning-based modules are designed to handle data-dependent initialization, high-efficient unfolding optimization, and user-specified illumination enhancement. The unfolding optimization module utilizes two networks to fit implicit priors in a data-driven manner, resulting in noise suppression and preservation of image details in the final decomposition results. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world low-light images demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of URetinex-Net compared to state-of-the-art methods.
