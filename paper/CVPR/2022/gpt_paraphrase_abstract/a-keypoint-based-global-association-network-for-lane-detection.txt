Lane detection is a challenging task that involves predicting complex lane line shapes and distinguishing different types of lanes simultaneously. Previous approaches have used predefined anchors to regress lane line shapes, but these fixed anchor shapes limit the ability to fit complex lane shapes. Recent approaches have formulated lane detection as a keypoint estimation problem, gradually grouping adjacent keypoints belonging to the same lane line. However, this point-by-point approach is inefficient during postprocessing. In this paper, we propose a Global Association Network (GANet) that directly regresses each keypoint to the starting point of the lane line, instead of extending point-by-point. This global association is achieved by predicting offsets to the corresponding starting points of lanes independently, allowing for parallel processing and improved efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a Lane-aware Feature Aggregator (LFA) that captures local correlations between adjacent keypoints to enhance the global association with local information. Experimental results on two lane detection benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, achieving an F1 score of 79.63% on the CULane dataset and 97.71% on the Tusimple dataset with high frames per second (FPS).
