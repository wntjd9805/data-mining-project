We propose a new method for robust visual recognition in adverse weather conditions, specifically focusing on fog. Our approach involves treating the fog condition of an image as its style and aims to bridge the gap between images with different fog conditions in the neural style spaces of a segmentation model. To achieve this, we introduce a fog-pass filter module that extracts fog-relevant factors from the style, as the neural style of an image is influenced by various factors besides fog. By optimizing the fog-pass filter and the segmentation model alternately, we gradually reduce the style gap between different fog conditions and learn fog-invariant features. Our method outperforms previous techniques on three real foggy image datasets and also improves performance on both foggy and clear weather images, unlike existing methods that often degrade performance on clear scenes.
