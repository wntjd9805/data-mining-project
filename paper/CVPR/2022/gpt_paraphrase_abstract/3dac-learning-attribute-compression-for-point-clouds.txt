We present a study on attribute compression for large-scale unstructured 3D point clouds. Our research focuses on exploring the relationships between encoding steps and attribute channels. We introduce a deep compression network called 3DAC, which aims to compress the attributes of 3D point clouds and reduce storage usage. Initially, we convert attributes like color and reflectance into transform coefficients. Then, we propose a deep entropy model to estimate the probabilities of these coefficients, taking into account information from attribute transforms and previously encoded attributes. These estimated probabilities are utilized to further compress the transform coefficients into a final attributes bitstream. Extensive experiments conducted on indoor and outdoor point cloud datasets, namely ScanNet and SemanticKITTI, demonstrate the superior compression rates and reconstruction quality achieved by our method.
