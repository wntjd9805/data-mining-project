Stereo matching in foggy environments is a difficult task due to the blurring effect of fog, which makes it challenging to accurately match corresponding image regions. Previous methods consider fog as noise and discard it before performing matching. In contrast, we propose a novel approach that leverages depth hints obtained from the fog to enhance stereo matching. Our method is inspired by the concept of rendering, where we reverse the atmospheric scattering process and remove fog within a specific depth range. The quality of the rendered image serves as an indicator of the accuracy of the selected depth, with clearer images indicating a closer approximation to the true depth. To collect these depth hints, we introduce a fog volume representation. This fog volume is constructed by stacking rendered images using disparity candidates, which are also used to build the cost volume. By fusing the fog volume with the cost volume, we can rectify the ambiguous matching caused by fog. Experimental results demonstrate that our fog volume representation significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance in foggy scenes by 10% to 30%, while maintaining comparable performance in clear scenes.
