This study examines the issue of geometric consistency in monocular 3D object detection, which is hindered by the unreliable estimation of depth. Through a comprehensive analysis, we identify the shortcomings of existing methods in consistently localizing objects under different geometric shifts. To address this problem, we propose four geometry-aware data augmentation techniques to enhance the geometric consistency of detectors. Firstly, we adapt commonly used 2D image augmentation methods to maintain geometric consistency in 3D space. We demonstrate the significance of these modifications. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-specific image perturbation method that involves manipulating the camera movement while preserving geometric visual cues for depth recovery. We show that by incorporating geometric consistency constraints, the proposed augmentation techniques lead to improvements in monocular 3D detection benchmarks such as KITTI and nuScenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of these augmentation methods in semi-supervised training and cross-dataset generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results.
