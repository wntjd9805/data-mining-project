This paper addresses the need for predictive models for high-resolution videos, which have not been extensively explored despite the increasing demand for high-quality videos. High-resolution videos contain more detailed spatial and complex temporal information compared to low-resolution videos. To tackle this challenge, the authors propose a Spatiotemporal Residual Predictive Model (STRPM) for high-resolution video prediction. The model includes a Spatiotemporal Encoding-Decoding Scheme that preserves more spatiotemporal information, allowing for the preservation of appearance details in each frame. Additionally, a Residual Predictive Memory (RPM) is designed to focus on modeling the spatiotemporal residual features between previous and future frames, enabling the capture of complex motion information. The proposed RPM also supervises the spatial and temporal encoders, extracting features in the spatial and temporal domains, respectively. The model is trained using generative adversarial networks (GANs) with a learned perceptual loss to improve the perceptual quality of the predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that STRPM outperforms existing methods in generating satisfactory results for high-resolution video prediction. The paper acknowledges the support of various funding sources and includes a qualitative comparison of STRPM with a state-of-the-art method on a 4K dataset, showing the superior visual details generated by STRPM.
