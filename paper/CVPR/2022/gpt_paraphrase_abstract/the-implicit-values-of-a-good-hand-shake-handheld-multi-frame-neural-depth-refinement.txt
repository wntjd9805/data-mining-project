This study explores the use of modern smartphones to capture high-fidelity depth maps during snapshot photographs. By utilizing the natural hand shake of the photographer, along with RGB and low-resolution LiDAR-driven depth information, millimeter-scale variations in camera pose can be captured in a circular buffer. The researchers propose a method that combines dense micro-baseline parallax cues with kilopixel LiDAR depth to generate accurate depth maps. This is achieved through a test-time optimization approach and training a coordinate MLP to produce consistent depth estimates along the path of the hand shake. The proposed method does not require any additional hardware, artificial hand motion, or user interaction beyond pressing a button, making it suitable for point-and-shoot photography of textured objects at close range.
