This paper introduces a novel approach to improve monocular 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Existing methods often treat each 3D object independently, neglecting their geometric relationships and leading to limited spatial constraints. The proposed method considers all objects in the scene and explores their mutual relationships to enhance the estimation of 3D boxes. Additionally, since 2D detection is currently more reliable, the study investigates the use of detected 2D boxes to globally constrain the optimization of corresponding predicted 3D boxes. A differentiable loss function called Homography Loss is introduced to achieve this goal, leveraging both 2D and 3D information to balance the positional relationships between objects and improve the accuracy of 3D box predictions. The proposed loss function is versatile and can be incorporated into any mature monocular 3D detector, significantly enhancing its performance compared to baseline methods. Experiments conducted on the KITTI 3D datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, making it the leading method as of November 2021.
