This study presents a new approach to address the problem of recognizing rare classes in the long-tail distribution using knowledge transfer without the need for additional training. The objective is to transfer knowledge from common classes to rare classes that lack sufficient data, in order to improve the representation of the rare classes. The approach leverages the distinct representations provided by class prototypes and cosine classifiers in feature space, and employs an attention mechanism to select and combine features from common classes to enhance the representations of rare classes. The knowledge transfer process does not require additional training, reducing the risk of overfitting and allowing for the expansion of classifiers to new classes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance improvements for rare classes while maintaining robust performance for common classes, surpassing state-of-the-art models with similar capabilities.
