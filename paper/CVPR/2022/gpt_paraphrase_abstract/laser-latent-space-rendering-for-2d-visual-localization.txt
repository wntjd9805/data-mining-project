We introduce LASER, a 2D floor map localization framework called Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) that utilizes image-based techniques. The key innovation of LASER is the concept of latent space rendering, which involves directly rendering 2D pose hypotheses onto a geometrically-structured latent space using aggregated viewing ray features. By dynamically determining the features at rendering-time based on their geometries, such as length and incident-angle, our representation exhibits fine-grain variability that is dependent on the viewpoint. This is achieved through a rendering codebook scheme that effectively separates feature encoding from rendering, enabling high-speed rendering at over 10KHz. Additionally, our geometrically-structured latent space is shared between pose hypotheses and query images with arbitrary fields of view through metric learning. This allows LASER to achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale indoor localization datasets (ZInD and Structured3D) for both panorama and perspective image queries, surpassing existing learning-based methods in terms of speed.
