We introduce GI-RAFFE HD, a high-resolution 3D-aware generative model that builds upon the success of the current state-of-the-art model GIRAFFE. While GIRAFFE can control various aspects of image generation without supervision, it performs best at low image resolutions. GI-RAFFE HD addresses this limitation by generating high-quality, high-resolution images (5122 resolution and above). Our approach involves using a style-based neural renderer and independently generating the foreground and background. This allows us to disentangle these components and impose consistency constraints to stitch them together, resulting in a coherent final image. Through experiments on multiple natural image datasets, we demonstrate that GI-RAFFE HD achieves state-of-the-art 3D controllable high-resolution image generation.
