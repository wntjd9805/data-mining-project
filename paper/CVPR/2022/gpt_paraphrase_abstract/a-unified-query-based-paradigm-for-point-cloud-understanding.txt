This paper introduces a new approach called the Embedding-Querying paradigm (EQ-Paradigm) for 3D point cloud understanding tasks in autonomous driving and robotics. The EQ-Paradigm is a unified framework that allows different 3D backbone architectures to be combined with various task heads, such as detection, segmentation, and classification. In this paradigm, the input is first encoded using a feature extraction architecture that is independent of the specific task and head. Then, the querying stage utilizes an intermediate representation called Q-representation to connect the embedding stage and task heads. The authors propose a novel network called Q-Net for the querying stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the EQ-Paradigm combined with Q-Net is a versatile and effective pipeline, enhancing the performance of existing methods in various 3D tasks.
