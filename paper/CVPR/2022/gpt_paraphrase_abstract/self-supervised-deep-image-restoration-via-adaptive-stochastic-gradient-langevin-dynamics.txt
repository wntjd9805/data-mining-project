This paper introduces a self-supervised deep learning approach to image restoration problems, as an alternative to supervised methods that require labeled truth images. The approach is based on a neuralized estimator that utilizes an adaptive stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics algorithm to sample the posterior distribution of network weights. The method is applied to compressed sensing and phase retrieval tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms existing non-learning and unsupervised solutions in terms of image restoration quality, while also being more computationally efficient.
