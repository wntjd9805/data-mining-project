This paper introduces a methodology called Locality Injection, which aims to improve the performance of fully-connected (FC) layers in image recognition tasks. FC layers are known for modeling long-range dependencies but struggle with capturing local patterns. The proposed approach incorporates local priors into FC layers by merging the trained parameters of a parallel convolutional kernel into the FC kernel. This method can be seen as a novel Structural Re-parameterization technique as it transforms the parameters and equivalently converts the structures.   To apply this methodology, the paper presents a multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) block called RepMLP Block, which consists of three FC layers for feature extraction. Additionally, a new architecture named RepMLPNet is introduced, which sets RepMLPNet apart from other vision MLPs by producing feature maps of different levels. This makes RepMLPNet suitable as a backbone model for tasks like semantic segmentation.   The study's results demonstrate that Locality Injection is a general methodology for MLP models. Furthermore, RepMLPNet achieves a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to other MLPs. Notably, RepMLPNet is the first MLP model that seamlessly transfers to Cityscapes semantic segmentation.
