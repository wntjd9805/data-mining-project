The field of 3D object detection in computer vision is rapidly growing. Previous methods for extracting features from irregularly and sparsely distributed points have used feature grouping modules, but they have not utilized the surface geometry of foreground objects. In this paper, we propose the RBGNet framework, a voting-based 3D detector that accurately detects objects from point clouds. We introduce a ray-based feature grouping module that aggregates point-wise features on object surfaces using rays emitted from cluster centers. We also design a foreground biased sampling strategy to sample more points on object surfaces, improving detection performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/Haiyang-W/RBGNet.
