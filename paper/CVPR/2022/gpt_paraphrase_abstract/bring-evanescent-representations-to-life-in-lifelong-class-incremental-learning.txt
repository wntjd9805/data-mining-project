Class Incremental Learning (CIL) involves training a classification model in incremental steps on a changing dataset of new classes while preserving knowledge of previously observed classes. Prototypical representations can be used to model feature distribution for past data and incorporate information from former classes in later incremental steps without using stored exemplars. However, if these representations are not updated, they become outdated as new classes are added. To address these issues, we propose a framework that (i) learns the relationship between representations of past and novel classes to model semantic drift, and (ii) estimates feature drift, which refers to the evolution of representations learned by models in each incremental step. By leveraging semantic and feature drifts, we can infer up-to-date representations of past classes (called evanescent representations) and integrate past knowledge into incremental training. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks without using exemplars. In the ablation study, we explore the significant connections between evanescent representations and models.
