This paper introduces the Unbiased Subclass Regularization Network (USRN) as a solution to the class-bias problem in semi-supervised semantic segmentation. While deep neural networks have made significant progress in this field, they often struggle with exploring unlabelled images due to the imbalanced class distribution in the labelled images. To address this issue, USRN creates balanced subclass distributions by clustering pixels of each original class into multiple subclasses of similar sizes. This approach provides class-balanced pseudo supervision to regulate the class-biased segmentation. Furthermore, the paper proposes an entropy-based gate mechanism that coordinates learning between the original classes and the clustered subclasses. This mechanism effectively suppresses uncertain subclass predictions and facilitates the subclass regularization process. Extensive experiments conducted on various public benchmarks demonstrate that USRN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance. The motivation behind this work is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows how a segmentation model trained using class-imbalanced labels tends to produce class-biased segmentation on unlabelled data. By learning from class-balanced clusters with balanced subclass distributions, USRN mitigates the class imbalance issue and generates class-unbiased segmentation on unlabelled data.
