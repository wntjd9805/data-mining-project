Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool for diagnosing and treating diseases, but its long acquisition times can lead to motion artifacts and limit its effectiveness. To address this issue, researchers have developed methods such as Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing, which increase MRI acquisition speed by reconstructing images from sub-sampled data. Recent advancements in Deep Learning, combined with these techniques, offer the potential for high-quality reconstructions from highly accelerated MRI data.  In this study, we present a new Deep Learning-based approach called the Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet) for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction. This method combines the use of Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks and unrolled algorithms to solve the inverse problem of multi-coil accelerated MRI reconstruction. The RecurrentVarNet consists of multiple recurrent blocks, each responsible for one iteration of the variational optimization scheme. Unlike traditional methods, our approach performs optimization steps in the observation domain (k-space) rather than the image domain. Each block refines the observed k-space using a data consistency term and a recurrent unit that takes a learned hidden state and the prediction from the previous block as input.  We evaluated our method on a publicly available multi-coil brain dataset with 5-fold and 10-fold accelerated data. Our proposed approach outperformed previous conventional and deep learning-based methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative reconstruction results. We have made our code publicly available for further research.  Figure 1 provides an overview of our RecurrentVarNet framework for multi-coil accelerated MRI reconstruction. The model takes sub-sampled MRI data from multiple coils and refines them using an iterative optimization scheme in the k-space. The output is an estimate of the ground truth reconstructed image.  In summary, our study introduces a novel Deep Learning-based approach, the RecurrentVarNet, for accelerated MRI reconstruction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and shows promise for improving the speed and quality of MRI scans.
