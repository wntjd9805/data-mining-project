This abstract discusses the challenges of determining semantic patterns of fine-grained objects due to subtle appearance differences and uncontrollable object poses in images. It proposes a novel graph-based object representation to address pose variations and achieve self-supervised pose alignment across classes. This representation is used as an auxiliary feature regularization in a deep representation learning network. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine supervision and a pose-insensitive constraint on shallow-to-deep sub-networks are employed to encourage discriminative features in a curriculum learning manner. The proposed method is evaluated on three fine-grained object classification benchmarks and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code for the method is available at the provided GitHub link.
