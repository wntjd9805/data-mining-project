Image harmonization aims to ensure visual consistency in composite images by adapting the foreground to match the background. However, current methods only use the real image as a positive sample for training, with the composite image serving as a single negative sample for an auxiliary constraint. This approach limits the understanding of distortion and results in a large solution space, leading to distorted harmonized images. Additionally, these methods do not consider consistency between the foreground self-style and foreground-background style, exacerbating the problem. Furthermore, region-aware adaptive instance normalization techniques only focus on the global background feature distribution, causing biases in the aligned foreground feature distribution. To address these issues, we propose a self-consistent style contrastive learning scheme (SCS-Co). Our method dynamically generates multiple negative samples, allowing for a better understanding of distortion and effective regularization of the harmonized image in the style representation space. It considers both foreground self-style and foreground-background style consistency, resulting in more realistic visual outcomes. Furthermore, we introduce a background-attentional adaptive instance normalization (BAIN) technique that adjusts the background feature distribution based on the similarity to the foreground-background features. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative measures and visual analysis.
