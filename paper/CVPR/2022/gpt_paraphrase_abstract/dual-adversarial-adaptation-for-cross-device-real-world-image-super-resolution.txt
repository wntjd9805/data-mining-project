This paper explores the challenge of adapting a super-resolution (SR) model trained on paired images from one camera to low-resolution (LR) images captured by different devices. The lack of paired data from various devices makes this task highly challenging. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation mechanism called Dual ADversarial Adaptation (DADA). DADA utilizes the Domain-Invariant Attention (DIA) module to establish the basis of target model training without high-resolution supervision. The dual framework of DADA includes an Inter-domain Adversarial Adaptation (InterAA) for two LR input images from different domains and an Intra-domain Adversarial Adaptation (IntraAA) for one LR input image. These adaptations improve the transferability of the model from the source to the target domain. The authors conduct experiments under six Realâ†’Real adaptation settings using three different cameras and achieve superior performance compared to existing approaches. They also evaluate DADA for adaptation to video cameras, which shows promise for wider applications of real-world super-resolution.
