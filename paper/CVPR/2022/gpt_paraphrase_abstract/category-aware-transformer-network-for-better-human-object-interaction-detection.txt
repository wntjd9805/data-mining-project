Human-Object Interactions (HOI) detection is crucial for understanding images, as it involves localizing a human and a relevant object while recognizing their interaction. Transformer-based models have significantly advanced HOI detection, but their capability has not been fully explored because the Object Query is often initialized as zeros, which affects performance. In this study, we propose the Category-Aware Transformer Network (CATN) to promote transformer-based HOI detectors. CATN initializes the Object Query using category-aware semantic information obtained from an external object detection model, resulting in improved performance. Additionally, these category priors enhance feature representation through the attention mechanism. We first verify our approach using an Oracle experiment, initializing the Object Query with groundtruth category information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline model by a large margin, achieving a new state-of-the-art result in HOI detection.
