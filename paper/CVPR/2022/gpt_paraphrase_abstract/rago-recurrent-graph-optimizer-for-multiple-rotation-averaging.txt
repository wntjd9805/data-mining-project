This paper introduces RAGO, a deep recurrent Rotation Averaging Graph Optimizer, designed for Multiple Rotation Averaging (MRA). Existing optimization-based methods often fail to generate accurate results due to corrupted and noisy relative measurements. Recent learning-based approaches treat MRA as a regression problem but are sensitive to initialization because of the gauge freedom issue. To address these challenges, we propose a learnable iterative graph optimizer that minimizes a gauge-invariant cost function and incorporates an edge rectification strategy to mitigate the impact of inaccurate measurements. Our graph optimizer iteratively refines global camera rotations by minimizing individual rotation objective functions for each node. Additionally, our approach iteratively rectifies relative rotations to ensure consistency with current camera orientations and observed relative rotations. Moreover, we employ a gated recurrent unit to enhance the results by capturing temporal information from the cost graph. Our framework is a real-time learning-to-optimize rotation averaging graph optimizer with a small size, suitable for real-world applications. RAGO outperforms previous traditional and deep methods on both real-world and synthetic datasets. The code for RAGO is available on GitHub at github.com/sfu-gruvi-3dv/RAGO.
