SSCD is a novel model designed for image copy detection, which is crucial for content moderation. The model is built upon the concept of self-supervised contrastive training and incorporates various modifications to suit the copy detection task. These modifications include altering the architecture, introducing a pooling operator from the instance matching literature, and adapting contrastive learning to image augmentations.One key aspect of SSCD is the inclusion of an entropy regularization term, which encourages distinct separation between descriptor vectors. This regularization significantly enhances the accuracy of copy detection. Moreover, SSCD generates compact descriptor vectors that are well-suited for real-world web scale applications. Additionally, the model allows the incorporation of statistical information from a background image distribution into the descriptor.In the DISC2021 benchmark, SSCD surpasses both baseline copy detection models and self-supervised architectures designed for image classification by a wide margin in all scenarios. For instance, SSCD outperforms SimCLR descriptors by an impressive 48% in absolute terms.To facilitate further research and implementation, the code for SSCD is publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/sscd-copy-detection.
