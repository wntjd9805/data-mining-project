Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect in various AI applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods often overlook the potential distribution differences between training and testing motions, leading to a decline in performance. In order to address this issue, we propose a new framework called Transferable Graph Neural Network (T-GNN). T-GNN combines trajectory prediction with domain alignment to overcome the disparities across different trajectory domains.To achieve this, we introduce a domain-invariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) that explores the structural motion knowledge while reducing domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, we propose an attention-based adaptive knowledge learning module to capture fine-grained individual-level feature representations for knowledge transfer. This approach helps to alleviate the differences between trajectory domains more effectively.We conducted challenging yet practical trajectory prediction experiments and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to bridge the gap in benchmarks and techniques for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction across different domains.In an example illustrating the limitation of the original learning strategy, two frames from different scenes show a significant difference in trajectories. This highlights the need for addressing distribution differences between trajectory domains.Table 1 provides statistics for five different scenes: ETH, HOTEL, UNIV, ZARA1, and ZARA2. The table includes information such as the number of sequences to be predicted, the number of pedestrians, the average number of pedestrians in each sequence, the average velocity of pedestrians in each sequence, and the average acceleration of pedestrians in each sequence. The metrics E-D and S-D represent Extreme Deviation and Standard Deviation, respectively.In summary, our proposed Transferable Graph Neural Network framework addresses the issue of distribution differences between training and testing motions in pedestrian trajectory prediction. We introduce a domain-invariant GNN and an attention-based adaptive knowledge learning module to improve performance. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our model, making it a pioneer in the field of pedestrian trajectory prediction across different domains.
