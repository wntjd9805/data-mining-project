Coordinate-based networks have become a valuable tool for representing and reconstructing 3D scenes. However, current architectures lack transparency and predictability, making it difficult to analyze their spectral characteristics and behavior at unsupervised points. Additionally, these networks are typically trained to represent signals at a single scale, leading to artifacts when downsampling or upsampling. To address these limitations, we propose band-limited coordinate networks (BACON), which have an analytical Fourier spectrum. BACON offers controlled behavior at unsupervised points, allows for design based on signal spectral characteristics, and enables representation of signals at multiple scales without per-scale supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BACON in the multiscale neural representation of images, radiance fields, and 3D scenes using signed distance functions. Our results show that BACON outperforms traditional single-scale coordinate networks in terms of interpretability and quality.
