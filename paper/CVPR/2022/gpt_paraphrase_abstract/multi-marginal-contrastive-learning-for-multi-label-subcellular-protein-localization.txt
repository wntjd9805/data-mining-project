This study focuses on the challenging task of protein subcellular localization (PSL) in order to understand human cell functions and cancer pathogenesis. The field of computer vision has shown interest in this area, but there are several obstacles that hinder the development of strong generalization models using deep learning. These obstacles include the large size of immune histochemical (IHC) images, the disorganized distribution of protein locations in different tissue images, and the limited availability of training images. To address these challenges, the authors propose a novel deep learning method for PSL using multi-marginal contrastive learning. This method aims to identify the same PSLs in different tissue images and different PSLs within the same tissue image. The approach involves learning the representation of an IHC image by combining global features from downsampled images and local features from selected patches using an activation map. This helps overcome the issue of oversize in IHC images. Furthermore, the authors introduce a multi-marginal attention mechanism to generate contrastive pairs with different margins. This mechanism enhances the discriminative features of PSL patterns effectively. Finally, ensemble prediction is performed by considering different patches within each IHC image. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of PSL tasks.
