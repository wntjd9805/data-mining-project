Adversarial training (AT) is commonly approached as a min-max problem, where the effectiveness relies on the optimization process that generates adversarial examples (AEs). Previous methods have typically used Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) with manually set attack parameters to generate AEs. The combination of these attack parameters is known as an attack strategy. However, it has been observed that using a fixed attack strategy throughout the entire training phase limits the model's robustness. To address this, some studies have proposed using different attack strategies at different stages of training to enhance robustness. However, these multi-stage hand-crafted attack strategies require significant domain expertise and offer limited improvements in robustness. In this paper, we present a novel framework for adversarial training called "learnable attack strategy" (LAS-AT), which automatically generates attack strategies to enhance model robustness. Our framework consists of a target network that utilizes AEs for training to improve robustness, and a strategy network that generates attack strategies to control AE generation. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. The code for our framework is publicly available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/jiaxiaojunQAQ/LAS-AT.
