We propose a novel approach to estimate the poses of multiple instances of a source point cloud within a target point cloud. Unlike existing methods that require sampling numerous hypotheses to detect instances and reject outliers, our method directly groups correspondences into clusters using a distance invariance matrix. By automatically identifying instances and outliers through clustering, our method is both robust and efficient. We conducted evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that our approach can accurately register up to 20 instances with a high F1 score of 90.46% even in the presence of 70% outliers. Furthermore, our method outperforms existing methods, achieving results at least 10 times faster. The source code for our method is available on GitHub at https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/multi-instant-reg.
