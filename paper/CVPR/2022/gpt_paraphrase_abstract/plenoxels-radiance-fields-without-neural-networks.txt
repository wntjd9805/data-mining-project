We present Plenoxels, a novel system for generating realistic views called photorealistic view synthesis. Plenoxels use a sparse 3D grid with spherical harmonics to represent a scene. This representation can be optimized using gradient methods and regularization, without relying on any neural components. In comparison to Neural Radiance Fields, Plenoxels achieve two orders of magnitude faster optimization on standard benchmark tasks, while maintaining the same level of visual quality.
