Detecting fake but photorealistic images is a difficult task with significant implications for social, biometrics security, and privacy concerns. Previous research has identified spectral domain artifacts in fake images generated by powerful generative adversarial network (GAN) methods. To address this, various frequency domain methods have been proposed to accurately detect GAN-generated images. In this study, we introduce a pipeline that effectively reduces these spectral artifacts. Our experiments demonstrate that by using the proposed methods, the artifacts in the frequency spectrum of fake images can be mitigated, resulting in a significant decrease in the performance of spectrum-based detectors. We also present experimental results using a large database of images synthesized by different GAN models, including high-resolution fingerprint images, to showcase the effectiveness of our methods. Additionally, we incorporate a spatial-domain based fake image detector and observe a notable decrease in detection performance when the proposed method is applied. In conclusion, our analysis and pipeline caution the forensic community about the reliability of GAN-generated fake image detectors that rely on the analysis of frequency artifacts, as these artifacts can be easily mitigated.
