A compositional question is one that contains multiple visual concepts and requires compositional reasoning to answer. While existing models for Visual Question Answering (VQA) can answer compositional questions well, they struggle with reasoning consistency in answering both the main question and its sub-questions. This inconsistency can be observed when a model answers the main question correctly but fails to answer the sub-question accurately. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dialog-like reasoning method that maintains reasoning consistency in answering compositional questions and their sub-questions. The method integrates the reasoning processes for sub-questions into the overall reasoning process for the main question, resembling a dialog task. Additionally, a consistency constraint is applied to penalize inconsistent answer predictions. To evaluate the reasoning consistency quantitatively, a GQA-Sub dataset is constructed based on the well-organized GQA dataset. Experimental results on both the GQA dataset and the GQA-Sub dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The answer format only outputs the abstraction.
