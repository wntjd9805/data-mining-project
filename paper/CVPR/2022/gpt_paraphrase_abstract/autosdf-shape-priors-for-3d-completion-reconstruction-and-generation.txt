This paper introduces a novel autoregressive prior for 3D shapes that enables solving multimodal 3D tasks such as shape completion, reconstruction, and generation. The approach models the distribution over 3D shapes using a non-sequential autoregressive distribution on a discretized, low-dimensional, symbolic grid-like latent representation. This allows for representing distributions conditioned on spatially anchored query locations, enabling shape completion in arbitrary settings. The learned autoregressive prior can also be used for conditional tasks like single-view reconstruction and language-based generation by learning task-specific conditionals. The proposed method outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods trained for individual tasks, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluation.
