This study addresses the challenge of monocular depth estimation for high-resolution 360° imagery, which is important for applications like virtual reality. Existing CNN-based methods cannot handle such resolutions due to limited GPU memory. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a flexible framework that utilizes tangent images. By projecting the 360° input image onto tangent planes, perspective views suitable for accurate monocular depth estimation are obtained. To ensure globally consistent disparity estimates, the authors employ deformable multi-scale alignment and gradient-domain blending techniques. The result is a detailed, high-resolution 360° depth map that even supports outdoor scenes not covered by existing methods.
