This study introduces a new deep video compression framework called coarse-to-fine (C2F) that improves motion compensation. Unlike previous approaches, the C2F framework performs motion estimation, compression, and compensation twice in a coarse to fine manner. This approach achieves better motion compensation without significantly increasing bit costs. Additionally, the study proposes two efficient hyperprior-guided mode prediction methods based on observing hyperprior information from hyperprior networks. These methods utilize the mean and variance values to predict optimal block resolutions for better motion coding and to determine whether to skip residual information for better residual coding. These predictions are made without introducing additional bit costs or significant extra computation costs. Experimental results demonstrate that the C2F video compression framework with the new hyperprior-guided mode prediction methods achieves state-of-the-art performance on HEVC, UVG, and MCL-JCV datasets.
