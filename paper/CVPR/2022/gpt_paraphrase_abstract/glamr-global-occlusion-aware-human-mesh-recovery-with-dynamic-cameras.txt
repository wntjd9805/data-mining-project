We introduce a method for reconstructing 3D human mesh from monocular videos captured by dynamic cameras. Our method is able to handle occlusions and track human bodies even when they are outside the camera's field of view. To address occlusions, we propose a deep generative motion in-filler that fills in the missing body motions based on visible motions. Unlike previous approaches, our method reconstructs human meshes in consistent global coordinates despite the use of dynamic cameras. Since the reconstruction of human motions and camera poses is not fully constrained, we propose a global trajectory predictor that generates global human trajectories based on local body movements. We then use these predicted trajectories as references in a global optimization framework that refines the trajectories and optimizes the camera poses to match the video evidence. Experimental results on challenging indoor and outdoor datasets with dynamic cameras demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods in terms of motion filling and global mesh recovery.
