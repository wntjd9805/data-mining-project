Cross-language image modality retrieval is a crucial problem in the field of E-commerce, as it is essential for product search, recommendation, and marketing services. While efforts have been made to address cross-modal retrieval in general domains, the standard approach in E-commerce is to use pretrained models and fine-tune them with E-commerce data. However, this approach often leads to sub-optimal performance, as it overlooks the unique characteristics of E-commerce multimodal data. Recent studies have shown improvements in handling product images, but no existing method has effectively tackled the challenges posed by E-commerce language. This research focuses on this particular issue, which involves dealing with special meaning entities that are prevalent in the fashion clothing business, such as brand names, categories, and fit descriptions. By treating the misinterpretation of these entities as confounding factors that hinder retrieval, we propose an intervention-based entity-aware contrastive learning framework. This framework consists of two modules: the Confounding Entity Selection Module and the Entity-Aware Learning Module. Our method achieves competitive performance on the Fashion-Gen E-commerce benchmark, with relative improvements of 10.3% and 10.5% in image-to-text and text-to-image retrievals, respectively.
