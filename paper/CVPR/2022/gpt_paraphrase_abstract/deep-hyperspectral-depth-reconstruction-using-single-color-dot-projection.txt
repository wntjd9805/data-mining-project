This paper introduces a novel method for simultaneously reconstructing depth and hyperspectral reflectance using a standard RGB camera and projector. Previous research has focused on these two topics separately and required special hardware. The proposed method utilizes a single color-dot projection to capture both depth and spatially-varying color illuminations for hyperspectral reflectance. A new network architecture is developed to jointly reconstruct depth and hyperspectral reflectance from a single color-dot image, incorporating a geometric color-dot pattern loss and a photometric hyperspectral reflectance loss. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms existing approaches for single-shot hyperspectral reflectance and depth reconstruction.
