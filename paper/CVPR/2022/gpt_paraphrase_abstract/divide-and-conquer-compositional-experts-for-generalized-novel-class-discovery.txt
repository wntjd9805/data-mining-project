In response to the rapidly increasing need for annotated data, Novel Class Discovery (NCD) has emerged as a promising approach for automatically recognizing unknown classes without annotations. A model is used to learn basic semantic discriminality from a base set, which can then be transferred to recognize novel classes. However, most existing methods handle the base and novel sets separately, leading to difficulties in generalizing to both sets. In this study, we focus on the generalized setting of NCD (GNCD) and propose a solution using two groups of Compositional Experts (ComEx). Each group of experts characterizes the entire dataset in a comprehensive and complementary manner, allowing us to efficiently solve GNCD. We also address the limitations of current NCD methods by enhancing ComEx with global-to-local and local-to-local regularization. We evaluate the performance of ComEx1 on four popular benchmarks and demonstrate its clear superiority in achieving the goal of GNCD.
