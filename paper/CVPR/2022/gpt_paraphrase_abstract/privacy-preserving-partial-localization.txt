Recently, there have been proposed solutions to protect privacy in cloud-based localization by using randomized 3D line clouds instead of traditional point-based maps. However, these solutions have two main limitations. Firstly, if the line clouds are not carefully constructed, they are vulnerable to density-based inversion attacks, which can compromise the privacy of the data. Secondly, even after successful localization, the precise camera orientation and position are revealed to the server, which can be sensitive information in certain scenarios.  To address these limitations, we propose a method that overcomes these challenges based on two key observations. Firstly, a full 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose is not always necessary, and by combining egomotion tracking, even a one-dimensional localization can reduce uncertainty and correct drift. Secondly, instead of lifting the representation to lines, we lift it to parallel planes. This approach only provides partial constraints on the query pose, preventing the server from knowing the exact query location. If the client requires a full 6DoF pose, it can be obtained by combining the results from multiple queries, which can be temporally and spatially disjoint.  We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach and show that it has a small performance drop compared to both conventional methods and privacy-preserving approaches. This means that our method can effectively protect privacy while still maintaining reasonable performance in cloud-based localization.
