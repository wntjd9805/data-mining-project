We investigate the problem of efficient object detection using 3DLiDAR point clouds. Existing pipelines typically use random or farthest point sampling to downsample input point clouds, without considering the importance of each point for object detection. However, foreground points are more crucial than background points for object detectors. To address this, we propose IA-SSD, a single-stage point-based 3D detector. IA-SSD utilizes learnable downsampling strategies to select foreground points belonging to objects of interest. We also introduce a contextual centroid perception module to estimate precise instance centers. IA-SSD is designed with an encoder-only architecture for efficiency. Experimental results on large-scale detection benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of IA-SSD. It achieves a high speed of 80+ frames-per-second on the KITTI dataset using a single RTX2080Ti GPU. The code is available at https://github.com/yifanzhang713/IA-SSD.
