Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is commonly tackled using the tracking-by-detection approach, where object detections are linked over time. However, this association step involves discrete optimization problems that are often NP-hard and can only be accurately solved for small instances with current hardware. Adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) presents a potential solution, as it could offer a significant speedup for a range of NP-hard optimization problems in the near future. Nevertheless, existing MOT formulations are not suitable for quantum computing due to their scaling properties. Hence, this study proposes a new MOT formulation specifically designed for AQC. The formulation employs an Ising model that represents the quantum mechanical system implemented on the AQC. Results demonstrate that our approach competes favorably with state-of-the-art optimization-based methods, even when utilizing off-the-shelf integer programming solvers. Furthermore, we show that our MOT problem can already be solved on current-generation quantum computers for small examples, and we analyze the characteristics of the obtained solutions.
