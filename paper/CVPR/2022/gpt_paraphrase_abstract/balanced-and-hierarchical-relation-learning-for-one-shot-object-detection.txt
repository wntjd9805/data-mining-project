Instance-level feature matching is crucial for the success of one-shot object detectors. While metric-learning based methods have shown promising results, they often only consider relations between query and target objects on a single level, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a balanced and hierarchical learning approach for our detector. Firstly, we introduce a novel Instance-level Hierarchical Relation (IHR) module that simultaneously encodes contrastive-level, salient-level, and attention-level relations to enhance the similarity representation between queries and relevant objects. Secondly, we address the issue of positive-negative sample imbalance in one-shot scenarios by introducing a Ratio-Preserving Loss (RPL). This loss protects the learning of rare positive samples and suppresses the effects of negative samples, ensuring consistent positive-negative ratios and improving query-related IHR learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 1.6% and 1.3% on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets for unseen classes, respectively.
