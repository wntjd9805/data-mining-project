Image hashing is an effective method for finding similar images in a large collection. The goal is to learn a function that maps an image to a binary vector. To achieve optimal retrieval performance, it is important to generate balanced hash codes with low quantization error. Existing supervised hashing methods struggle to achieve this due to heuristically constructed quantization approaches. This paper proposes an alternative approach that formulates the task as matching the distribution of continuous codes to a predefined discrete distribution. A computationally efficient distance metric is introduced, leveraging the discrete property of hash functions. This single-loss quantization objective can be integrated into any supervised hashing method to improve code balance and quantization error. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing the performance of various hashing methods.
