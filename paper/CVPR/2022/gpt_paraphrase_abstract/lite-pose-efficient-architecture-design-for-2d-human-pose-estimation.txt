This paper focuses on developing an efficient architecture for real-time multi-person pose estimation on edge devices. The high computational cost of state-of-the-art HRNet-based pose estimation models makes them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained edge devices. Through gradual shrinking experiments, the researchers discover that the high-resolution branches of HRNet are unnecessary for models in the low-computation region. Removing these branches improves both efficiency and performance. Building upon this finding, the researchers propose LitePose, an efficient single-branch architecture for pose estimation. They also introduce two approaches to enhance the capacity of LitePose: fusion deconv head and large kernel conv. Experimental results show that LitePose significantly reduces latency (up to 5.0Ã—) without compromising performance compared to previous efficient pose estimation models. This work pushes the boundaries of real-time multi-person pose estimation on edge devices. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/litepose.
