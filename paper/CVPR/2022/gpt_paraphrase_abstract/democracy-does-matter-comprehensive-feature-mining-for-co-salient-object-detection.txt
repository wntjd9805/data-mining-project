Co-salient object detection, which involves identifying salient objects that coexist in a group of images, is becoming increasingly popular. Recent approaches have utilized attention mechanisms or additional information to aggregate common co-salient features, but these methods often result in incomplete or even incorrect responses for the target objects. In this paper, our goal is to extract comprehensive co-salient features through a democratic prototype generation module, eliminating background interference without the need for extra information. The democratic prototype generation module generates democratic response maps that cover an ample amount of co-salient regions, capturing more shared attributes of co-salient objects. These response maps are then used to generate a comprehensive prototype, which serves as a guide for the final prediction. To suppress noisy background information in the prototype, we propose a self-contrastive learning module that forms positive and negative pairs without relying on additional classification information. Additionally, we introduce a democratic feature enhancement module that readjusts attention values to further strengthen the co-salient features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging real-world scenarios. Under the same settings, our model achieves a gain of 2.0% for MAE, 5.4% for maximum F-measure, 2.3% for maximum E-measure, and 3.7% for S-measure in the CoCA dataset.
