This paper explores the problem of removing multiple types of adverse weather conditions, such as haze, snow, and rain, using a unified model. The objective is to train a model with a single set of pre-trained weights that can effectively handle various adverse weather scenarios. A two-stage knowledge learning approach is proposed, consisting of knowledge collation (KC) and knowledge examination (KE). In the KC stage, the student network learns from multiple well-trained teacher networks, each specializing in a specific adverse weather removal task. A collaborative knowledge transfer method is introduced to facilitate this learning process. In the KE stage, the student model is trained and evaluated without the teacher networks, using a pixel loss derived from the ground truth. Additionally, a novel loss function called multi-contrastive knowledge regularization (MCR) loss is proposed to enhance the performance of the training framework. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate the promising results achieved by the student model in simultaneously addressing various adverse weather removal tasks.
