This study introduces a structure-preserving stitching approach that aims to maintain geometric structures in image stitching. Existing methods often neglect the representation of large-scale layouts depicted by straight lines or curves, resulting in reduced stitching quality. To address this limitation, the proposed method utilizes deep learning-based edge detection to extract different types of large-scale edges. These extracted edges are then sampled to create multiple sets of triangles, which serve as representations of the geometric structures. Additionally, a GEometric Structure (GES) energy term is introduced to ensure that these triangles undergo similarity transformation, preserving their geometric properties. To determine the weights of the sampling points on the geometric structure, an optimized GES energy term is presented. This term is integrated into the Global Similarity Prior (GSP) stitching model known as GES-GSP, which facilitates a smooth transition between local alignment and geometric structure preservation. The effectiveness of GES-GSP is validated through comprehensive experiments on a stitching dataset, demonstrating superior performance in preserving geometric structures and producing more natural stitching results compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset for GES-GSP are publicly available at https://github.com/flowerDuo/GES-GSP-Stitching.
