We introduce EfﬁcientNeRF, a method based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that offers an efficient approach to represent 3D scenes and generate novel-view images. While there are existing methods to speed up either the training or testing phase, it remains challenging to reduce the time for both phases simultaneously. To address this issue, we analyze the density and weight distribution of sampled points and propose effective sampling techniques at different stages of the process. This significantly improves the efficiency of data sampling. Additionally, we design a novel data sampling structure that caches the entire scene during testing, resulting in faster rendering speeds. Our method reduces training time by over 88% and achieves a rendering speed of over 200 frames per second, while still maintaining competitive accuracy. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method enhances the practicality of NeRF in real-world applications.
