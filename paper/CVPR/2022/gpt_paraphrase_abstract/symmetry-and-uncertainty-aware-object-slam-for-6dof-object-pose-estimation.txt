We present a novel framework for object-level SLAM that uses keypoints to estimate the 6DoF pose of both symmetric and asymmetric objects. Our system is one of the first to incorporate camera pose information from SLAM to track keypoints on symmetric objects, ensuring consistency with the 3D scene. Additionally, our semantic keypoint network predicts Gaussian covariance for the keypoints, capturing the true error of the prediction. This covariance serves as both a weight for optimization problems and a means to detect outliers without manual thresholds. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance in 6DoF object pose estimation, with real-time speed. Our code, pre-trained models, and keypoint labels are available at https://github.com/rpng/suo_slam.
