The task of video super-resolution often utilizes a recurrent structure. BasicVSR is a state-of-the-art method that effectively utilizes information from the entire input video through bidirectional propagation and feature alignment. In this research, we propose second-order grid propagation and flow-guided deformable alignment as improvements to BasicVSR. These enhancements enable the recurrent framework to better exploit spatiotemporal information from misaligned video frames. Our model, BasicVSR++, outperforms BasicVSR by a significant 0.82 dB in PSNR while maintaining a similar computational constraint. BasicVSR++ is also applicable to other video restoration tasks and achieves top rankings in the NTIRE 2021 video restoration challenge.
