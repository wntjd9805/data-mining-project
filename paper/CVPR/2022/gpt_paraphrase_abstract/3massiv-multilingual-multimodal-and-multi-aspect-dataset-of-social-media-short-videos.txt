We introduce 3MASSIV, an extensively annotated dataset of short videos sourced from the Moj short-video social media platform. This dataset is characterized by its multilingual, multimodal, and multi-aspect features. It consists of 50,000 short videos, averaging 20 seconds in duration, along with an additional 100,000 unlabeled videos. The videos cover a wide range of topics such as pranks, fails, romance, and comedy, and are expressed through various audio-visual formats like self-shot videos, reaction videos, lip-synching, and self-sung songs. By annotating the videos for concepts, affective states, media types, and audio language, 3MASSIV enables researchers to delve into multimodal and multilingual semantic understanding. Our thorough analysis of 3MASSIV showcases its distinctiveness and diversity compared to other popular datasets, which serves as a strong foundation for future studies. Furthermore, we highlight the dynamic and temporal nature of the social media content within 3MASSIV, emphasizing its potential for semantic understanding tasks and cross-lingual analysis.
