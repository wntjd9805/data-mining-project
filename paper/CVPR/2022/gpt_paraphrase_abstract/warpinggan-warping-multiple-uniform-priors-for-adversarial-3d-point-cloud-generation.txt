We propose a new network called WarpingGAN for generating 3D point clouds. Unlike existing methods, WarpingGAN learns a local-warping function to transform pre-defined priors into 3D shapes using local structure information. We also use the discriminator principle and a stitching loss to improve the quality of generated shapes. WarpingGAN is a lightweight network that can efficiently generate uniformly distributed point clouds of various resolutions. Experimental results show that WarpingGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of metrics, visual quality, and efficiency.
