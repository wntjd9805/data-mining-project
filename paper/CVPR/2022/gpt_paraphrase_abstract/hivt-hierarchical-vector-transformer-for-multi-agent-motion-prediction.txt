Accurate prediction of the future movements of other vehicles is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles. Vectorized approaches have become popular in motion prediction research due to their ability to capture complex interactions in traffic scenes. However, current methods ignore the symmetries of the problem and are computationally expensive, making it difficult to achieve real-time multi-agent motion prediction without sacrificing accuracy.  To address this challenge, we propose the Hierarchical VectorTransformer (HiVT) as a solution for fast and accurate multi-agent motion prediction. Our method breaks down the problem into two steps: local context extraction and global interaction modeling. This allows us to efficiently model a large number of agents in the scene. Additionally, we introduce translation-invariant scene representation and rotation-invariant spatial learning modules that extract features resistant to geometric transformations in the scene. This enables our model to make precise predictions for multiple agents in a single forward pass.  Experimental results demonstrate that HiVT outperforms existing methods in the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark while maintaining a small model size. Furthermore, our approach enables fast multi-agent motion prediction.
