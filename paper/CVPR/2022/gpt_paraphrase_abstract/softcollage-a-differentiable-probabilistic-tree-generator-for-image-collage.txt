The objective of the image collage task is to create a visually appealing summary of an image collection that is both informative and aesthetically pleasing. Existing methods have utilized tree-based algorithms to preserve image content, but they rely on manually crafted adjustment rules to optimize the collage tree structure. This approach limits the exploration of different collage tree structures. To address this limitation, we propose SoftCollage, a novel method that transforms the discrete tree structure space into a continuous probability space. This is achieved by employing a neural-based differentiable probabilistic tree generator. The generator produces a probability distribution of correlation-preserving collage trees, conditioned on deep image features, aspect ratio, and canvas size. The differentiable nature of our method allows us to treat collage generation as a differentiable process and optimize the collage layout in the probability space using gradients in an end-to-end manner. To facilitate further research in image collage, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset called AIC, which is publicly available for evaluation. Through extensive experiments on this dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.
