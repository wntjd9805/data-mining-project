This paper focuses on the challenge of detecting 3D objects using LiDAR technology in snowy conditions, which is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. Collecting and annotating training data in snowy settings is difficult, so we propose a physically based simulation method to replicate the effects of snowfall on LiDAR point clouds. Our method involves sampling snow particles in 2D space and using the resulting geometry to modify LiDAR measurements accordingly. Additionally, we simulate ground wetness caused by snowfall. By using our simulation to generate partially synthetic snowy LiDAR data, we train 3D object detection models that are robust to snowfall. We extensively evaluate our approach using various state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that our simulation consistently improves performance on real snowy datasets compared to clear-weather baselines and competing simulations. Importantly, our method does not sacrifice performance in clear weather conditions. The code for our simulation is available on GitHub at github.com/SysCV/LiDAR snow sim.
