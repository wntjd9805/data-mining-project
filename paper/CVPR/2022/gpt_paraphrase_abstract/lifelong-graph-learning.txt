Graph neural networks (GNN) are powerful models for various tasks involving graph-structured data. However, existing GNN models assume that the complete graph structure is available during training, which is not practical in real-world scenarios where graph data is often generated in a streaming manner. To address this, we propose a method that combines GNN with lifelong learning techniques from convolutional neural networks (CNN). We introduce a new graph topology called the feature graph, where features are treated as new nodes and existing nodes become independent graphs. This transformation allows us to convert the problem of node classification into graph classification. Through experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, called feature graph networks (FGN), by continuously learning a sequence of classical graph datasets. Furthermore, we show that FGN outperforms other methods in lifelong human action recognition with wearable devices and feature matching. Our proposed FGN is the first method to bridge graph learning and lifelong learning using this novel graph topology. The source code for FGN is available at https://github.com/wang-chen/LGL.
