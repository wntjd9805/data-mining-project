We present a solution to the problem of determining the internal skeletal structure of a person based on their external body surface. This has important applications in fields such as medicine and biomechanics. Current methods for predicting skeletons are limited in their ability to generalize to new subjects and often rely on heuristic approaches rather than data-driven learning. Our system, called OSSO (Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside), is the first to learn the mapping from body surface to internal skeleton using real data. We use a large dataset of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans and fit a parametric body shape model and a part-based skeleton model to capture the surface and bone structure, respectively. We then use this data to train a regressor to predict skeleton shape parameters from body shape parameters. Our system outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, as demonstrated by quantitative evaluations on held out DXA scans. We also showcase the ability of our system to predict skeletons from diverse and challenging body shapes. The code for inferring a skeleton from a body shape is publicly available, as well as the dataset used in this research. This work was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource.
