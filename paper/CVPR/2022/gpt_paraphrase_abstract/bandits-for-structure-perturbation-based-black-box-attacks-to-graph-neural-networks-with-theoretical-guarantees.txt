Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become highly successful in various graph-based tasks like node classification and graph classification. However, recent studies have revealed that GNN models can be easily fooled by making slight modifications to the graph structure. Existing attacks on GNNs either assume that the attacker has access to the GNN model parameters, which is not practical, or consider perturbing node features, which has been found to be ineffective. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing black-box attacks on GNNs that perturb the graph structure and provide theoretical guarantees. To achieve this, the authors propose using bandit techniques and formulate the attack as an online optimization problem with bandit feedback. The problem is challenging because perturbing the graph structure is a binary optimization problem that is NP-hard. The authors propose an online attack based on bandit optimization that has a sublinear complexity in terms of the number of queries made. They provide a theoretical guarantee of O(N T^(3/4)) for the query number T, where N is the number of nodes in the graph. The proposed attack is evaluated on multiple datasets and GNN models, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.
