Recent advancements in single-image human digitalization using deep learning and implicit shape learning techniques have achieved remarkable accuracy, enabling the recovery of intricate surface details like garment wrinkles. However, a common challenge faced by implicit-based methods is their inability to generate separate and topology-consistent meshes for each garment piece, which is crucial in the current 3D content creation process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework called ReEF that utilizes geometry inference to reconstruct topology-consistent layered garment meshes. This is achieved by aligning an explicit garment template with the implicit fields of the entire body, predicted from single images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in reconstructing layered garments from single images, thereby providing high-quality digital assets for further content creation.
