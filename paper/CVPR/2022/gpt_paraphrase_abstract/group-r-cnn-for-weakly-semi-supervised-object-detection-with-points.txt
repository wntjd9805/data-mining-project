We investigate the problem of weakly semi-supervised object detection with points (WSSOD-P). This involves training a point-to-box regressor using a small set of fully annotated images with bounding boxes and a large set of weakly-labeled images with only a single point annotated for each instance. Our goal is to develop a method that can accurately predict bounding boxes for each point annotation. We challenge the common belief that existing CNN-based detectors are not suitable for this task. To address this, we propose an approach called Group R-CNN, which is built upon the classic R-CNN architecture. Group R-CNN utilizes instance-level proposal grouping to generate a group of proposals for each point annotation, achieving a high recall rate. To improve precision, we introduce instance-level proposal assignment, replacing the vanilla assignment strategy used in original R-CNN methods. However, this naive instance-level assignment brings convergence difficulties. To overcome this, we propose instance-aware representation learning, which involves instance-aware feature enhancement and instance-aware parameter generation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, Group R-CNN outperforms the previous method Point DETR by 3.9 mAP with only 5% well-labeled images, which is the most challenging scenario.
