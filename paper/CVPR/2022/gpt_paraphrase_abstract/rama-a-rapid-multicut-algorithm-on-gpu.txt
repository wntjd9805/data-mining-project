We present a parallel primal-dual algorithm for the multicut problem, which is a commonly used graph clustering problem in machine learning and computer vision. Our algorithm consists of three steps: identifying conflicted cycles, performing message passing to optimize the relaxation, and contracting edges with high costs. This approach allows us to produce primal solutions and lower bounds that estimate the distance to the optimal solution. By implementing our algorithm on GPUs, we achieve significant improvements in execution speed compared to traditional sequential algorithms on CPUs, without compromising solution quality. We demonstrate the ability to solve large-scale benchmark problems with a high number of variables in just a few seconds, with small primal-dual gaps.
