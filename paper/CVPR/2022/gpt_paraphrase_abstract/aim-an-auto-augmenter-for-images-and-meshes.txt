Data augmentations are commonly used in deep neural networks to improve their robustness. However, in current research, the choice of augmentations is often task-agnostic and determined through grid search. Additionally, augmentations designed for lower-dimensional data cannot be easily applied to higher-dimensional data and vice versa. This paper introduces AIM (Auto-Augmenter for Images and Meshes), a method that seamlessly integrates into neural networks during training and inference. AIM optimizes in conjunction with the network to generate constrained, non-rigid deformations in the data. It predicts deformations tailored to each sample, taking into account the specific task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AIM across various networks.
