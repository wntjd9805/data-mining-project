We introduce D2-SONATA, a machine learning model based on a stochastic advection-diffusion equation, for predicting velocity and diffusion fields in 2D/3D image time-series of transport. Our model incorporates a measure of transport abnormality to distinguish between expected normal behavior and observed anomalies, enabling the quantification of pathologies in a medical context. By creating a 2D/3D anomaly-encoded advection-diffusion simulator, we improve the estimation performance for velocity, diffusion-tensor fields, and anomaly fields. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a brain perfusion dataset from ischemic stroke patients, successfully identifying stroke lesions and reconstructing the underlying velocity and diffusion tensor fields.
