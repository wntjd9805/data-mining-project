Learning the spatial-temporal relationship between multiple actors is crucial for recognizing group activities. However, modeling complex group activities from a single viewpoint is challenging due to the diverse interactions between actors. To address this issue, we propose the Dual-path Actor Interaction (Dual-AI) framework. This framework incorporates spatial and temporal transformers in two complementary orders, allowing for flexible arrangement and enhancing actor relations by combining the strengths of different spatio-temporal paths. Additionally, we introduce the Multi-scale Actor Contrastive Loss (MAC-Loss) which compares actor representations from the interactive paths of Dual-AI. By ensuring self-supervised actor consistency at both frame and video levels, MAC-Loss effectively distinguishes individual actors and reduces action confusion. As a result, our Dual-AI framework can improve group activity recognition by fusing discriminative features from different actors. We evaluate our approach on widely used benchmarks such as Volleyball, Collective Activity, and NBA datasets. The proposed Dual-AI achieves state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets. Notably, even with only 50% training data, Dual-AI outperforms several recent approaches that use 100% training data. This demonstrates the generalization power of Dual-AI for group activity recognition, even in scenarios with limited supervision.
