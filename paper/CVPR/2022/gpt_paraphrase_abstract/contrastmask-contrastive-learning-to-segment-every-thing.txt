This study introduces a new method called ContrastMask for partially-supervised instance segmentation. The task involves segmenting objects from new categories by learning from limited base categories with annotated masks, thereby reducing the need for extensive annotation. The key focus is on developing an effective class-agnostic mask segmentation model. Unlike previous approaches that only learn on base categories, ContrastMask learns the mask segmentation model on both base and novel categories using a unified pixel-level contrastive learning framework. This framework utilizes annotated masks of base categories and pseudo masks of novel categories as a prior for contrastive learning. It pulls together features from foreground (mask regions) and contrasts them against features from the background, improving the discrimination between foreground and background. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the superior performance of ContrastMask compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.
