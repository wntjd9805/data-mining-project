Realizing the difficulty and cost associated with obtaining large-scale noisy-clean pairs, this paper addresses the limitations of supervised denoisers trained on synthetic data and proposes a self-supervised approach called Blind2Unblind. The self-supervised denoising methods, particularly blindspot-driven ones, suffer from significant information loss during input or network design, leading to a dramatic reduction in denoising performance. To overcome this issue, the authors introduce a global-aware mask mapper that allows for global perception and faster training. This mapper samples all pixels at blind spots on denoised volumes and maps them to the same channel, enabling the optimization of all blind spots simultaneously. Additionally, a re-visible loss is proposed to train the denoising network and make blind spots visible. This loss allows the denoiser to learn directly from raw noise images without losing information or getting trapped in identity mapping. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of the convergence of the re-visible loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to previous methods. The code for implementing the approach is made available at https://github.com/demonsjin/Blind2Unblind.
