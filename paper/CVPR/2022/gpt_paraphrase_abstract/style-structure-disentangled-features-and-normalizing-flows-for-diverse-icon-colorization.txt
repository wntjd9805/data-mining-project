We propose a colorization network that can generate flat-color icons based on provided sketches and semantic colorization styles. Our network consists of a colorization module that separates style and structure, and a normalizing flow. The colorization module transforms paired sketch and style images into flat-color icons. To improve network performance and icon quality, we introduce a pixel-wise decoder, a global style code, and a contour loss to reduce color gradients in flat areas and increase color contrast at boundaries. The normalizing flow maps Gaussian vectors to different style codes based on the given colorization label, allowing users to control attributes and obtain diverse colorization results. Compared to existing methods that rely on conditional generative adversarial networks, our approach offers both high image quality and diversity. We conducted experiments comparing the flat-color icons generated by our method with other colorization and image-to-image translation techniques under different conditions. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both visual quality and quantitative measures.
