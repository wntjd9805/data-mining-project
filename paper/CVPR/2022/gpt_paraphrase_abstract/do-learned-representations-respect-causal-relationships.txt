This study examines whether attribute-specific representations of data respect the causal relations between the attributes. The researchers propose a method called NCINet for observational causal discovery from high-dimensional data. They train NCINet on synthetic representations and apply it to real representations, aiming to bridge the domain gap between the two. Using NCINet, they identify causal relations between image representations of different attribute pairs with both known and unknown causal relations. They analyze the impact of design choices in representation learning on the underlying causal relation. The experiments show that NCINet outperforms existing approaches in estimating causal relations between random samples, with or without unobserved confounders. They also find that learned representations can satisfy the underlying causal relations between their labels under controlled scenarios, and that the causal relations are positively correlated with the predictive capability of the representations.
