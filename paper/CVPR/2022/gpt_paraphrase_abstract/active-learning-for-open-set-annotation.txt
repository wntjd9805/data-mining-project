Most active learning studies focus on scenarios where all data examples to be labeled are from known classes. However, in real-world annotation tasks, there are often unlabeled examples from unknown classes, which current active learning methods struggle to handle. To address this challenge, we propose a new active learning framework called LfOSA. LfOSA enhances classification performance by using an effective sampling strategy to identify examples from known classes for annotation. In LfOSA, we introduce an auxiliary network that models the distribution of the maximum activation value (MAV) for each example using a Gaussian Mixture Model. This allows us to dynamically select examples with the highest probability of belonging to known classes from the unlabeled set. Additionally, by reducing the temperature of the loss function, we further optimize the detection model by leveraging both known and unknown supervision. Our experimental results demonstrate that LfOSA significantly improves the selection quality of known classes and achieves higher classification accuracy with lower annotation cost compared to state-of-the-art active learning methods. Notably, this is the first work to address active learning for open-set annotation.
