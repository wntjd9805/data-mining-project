The popularity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has led to the emergence of graph neural architecture search. However, the current approach to graph search places too much emphasis on learning node features and ignores the extraction of hierarchical relational information. Additionally, the complexity of the graph search space, due to diverse mechanisms in message passing, makes it difficult to apply traditional search strategies effectively. To address these issues, we propose Automatic Relation-aware Graph Network Proliferation (ARGNP), a method for efficiently searching GNNs using a relation-guided message passing mechanism. Our approach involves a novel dual relation-aware graph search space that incorporates node and relation learning operations, allowing for the extraction of hierarchical node and relational information. We also introduce a network proliferation search paradigm inspired by cell proliferation, which progressively determines GNN architectures through network division and differentiation. Experimental results on six datasets across four graph learning tasks demonstrate that the GNNs generated by our method outperform both hand-crafted and search-based GNNs currently considered state-of-the-art. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/phython96/ARGNP.
