This study focuses on the use of rigged puppets for 2D character animations. Rigged puppets involve dividing characters into separate moving parts. The authors propose a method to automatically identify these articulated parts from a small set of character poses found in a sprite sheet. The method is trained to infer the different parts, such as the head, torso, and limbs, in order to accurately reconstruct the given poses. The results show that this approach outperforms alternative methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
