Monocular 3D object detection is a popular technique due to its simplicity and cost advantages. However, it often suffers from inaccurate depth estimation and poor 3D detection results. To address this issue, we propose incorporating the ground plane as a prior in monocular 3D object detection. This ground plane prior serves as an additional geometric condition and aids in depth estimation. We also introduce a depth-align training strategy and a precise two-stage depth inference method specifically designed for the ground plane prior. Notably, our approach does not require additional data sources such as LiDAR, stereo images, or depth information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining fast processing speeds. Our code, models, and training logs are publicly available at https://github.com/cfzd/MonoGround.
