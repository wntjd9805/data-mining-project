This paper introduces the Contextual Instance Decoupling (CID) method, which offers a novel approach for multi-person pose estimation in crowded scenes. Rather than relying on person bounding boxes to distinguish individuals and locate their pose keypoints, CID separates individuals in an image into multiple instance-aware feature maps. Each feature map is then used to estimate keypoints for a specific person. Unlike bounding box detection, CID is differentiable and resilient to detection errors. By decoupling individuals into different feature maps, distractions from other individuals can be isolated, and context cues can be explored at scales larger than the size of the bounding box. Experimental results demonstrate that CID outperforms previous multi-person pose estimation methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on crowded scene pose estimation benchmarks. For example, it achieves a 71.3% Average Precision (AP) on CrowdPose, surpassing the recent single-stage DEKR by 5.6%, the bottom-up CenterAttention by 3.7%, and the top-down JC-SPPE by 5.3%. This advantage is also sustained on the widely used COCO benchmark.
