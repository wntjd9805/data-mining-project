Many current backdoor scanners are ineffective against advanced attacks that have large and widespread triggers. To address this issue, we propose a new detection method that generates triggers using a trigger inversion technique, specifically universal input patterns that convert victim class samples into a target class. We then determine if any of these triggers consist of features that are not natural distinguishing features between the victim and target classes. Our approach utilizes a unique symmetric feature differencing method to identify the features that separate two sets of samples from different classes. We evaluate our technique on various advanced attacks, including composite, reflection, hidden, filter, and traditional patch attacks, using thousands of models with different architectures, including clean and trojaned models. We compare our results with three state-of-the-art scanners and find that our technique achieves an accuracy of 80-88%, while the baselines only achieve 50-70% accuracy on complex attacks. In the TrojAI competition rounds 2-4, which involve patch and filter backdoors, existing scanners produce many false positives (clean models identified as trojaned), whereas our technique eliminates 78-100% of these false positives with a slight increase in false negatives (0-30%). This leads to an overall accuracy improvement of 17-41% and enables us to achieve top performance on the leaderboard.
