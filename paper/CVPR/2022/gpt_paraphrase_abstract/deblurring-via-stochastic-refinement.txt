Image deblurring is a challenging problem with many possible solutions. Existing methods often produce a single deterministic estimate of the clean image, which may not match human perception and can lead to unrealistic results. In this study, we propose a new approach to blind deblurring using conditional diffusion models. Unlike previous techniques, we train a stochastic sampler that refines the output of a deterministic predictor, generating a diverse set of plausible reconstructions. This significantly improves the perceptual quality of the deblurred images compared to state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks. Our predict-and-refine approach also allows for more efficient sampling compared to typical diffusion models. With a well-designed network architecture and inference procedure, our method achieves competitive distortion metrics such as PSNR. These results demonstrate the advantages of our diffusion-based approach for deblurring and challenge the commonly used strategy of producing a single deterministic reconstruction.
