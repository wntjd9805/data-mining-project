Vector graphics (VG) are widely used in various fields, such as engineering and architecture. Most existing methods for VG recognition involve converting VG into raster graphics (RG) and then conducting recognition based on RG formats. However, this approach disregards the geometric structure of VG and results in a loss of resolution. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to recognize directly from the original VG format, but they are susceptible to topological errors that can be eliminated through RG rendering. To overcome these limitations, it is suggested to utilize both VG and RG formats together. Additionally, it is argued that the VG-to-RG rendering process is crucial for effectively combining VG and RG information. By defining rules for transferring VG primitives to RG pixels, the rendering process captures the interaction and correlation between VG and RG. Consequently, RendNet, a unified architecture for recognition in both 2D and 3D scenarios, is proposed. RendNet incorporates both VG/RG representations and exploits their interaction by integrating the VG-to-RG rasterization process. Experimental results demonstrate that RendNet achieves outstanding performance in 2D and 3D object recognition tasks using various VG datasets.
