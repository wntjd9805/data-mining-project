We present a new approach for estimating LiDAR scene flow using recurrent neural networks. Existing methods often struggle with challenging cases involving sparse reflections and motion occlusions, leading to structure distortion. Our method addresses this issue by utilizing a recurrent neural network that incorporates direct rigidity constraints to preserve the geometric structure of the scene. Additionally, we introduce an error awarded optimization strategy that minimizes point measurement error instead of reconstructing the cost volume multiple times. Through training on two autonomous driving datasets, our network achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art networks on lidarKITTI.
