This study focuses on the problem of domain adaptive semantic segmentation, where only pseudo-labeled target data is available through a black-box model. The pseudo-labeled data contains both closed-set and open-set label noises due to the domain gap and label shift between the two domains. To address this issue, the paper proposes a simplex noise transition matrix (SimT) to model the mixed noise distributions and formulates the problem as the estimation of SimT. Three regularizers, namely volume regularization, anchor guidance, and convex guarantee, are designed to approximate the true SimT. The volume regularization minimizes the volume of the simplex formed by the rows of the non-square SimT to ensure that the outputs of the segmentation model fit the ground truth label distribution. Anchor guidance and convex guarantee are devised to handle open-set noise distribution and enhance feature learning between closed-set and open-set classes. The estimated SimT is then used to correct noise issues in pseudo labels and improve the generalization ability of the segmentation model on target domain data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SimT can be easily integrated into existing domain adaptive methods to enhance performance.
