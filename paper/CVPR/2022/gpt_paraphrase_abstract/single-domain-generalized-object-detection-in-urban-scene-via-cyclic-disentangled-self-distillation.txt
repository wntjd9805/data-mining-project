This paper focuses on improving the generalization capability of object detectors in a realistic and challenging scenario called Single-Domain Generalized Object Detection (Single-DGOD). Single-DGOD aims to train an object detector that performs well on multiple unseen target domains using only one source domain for training. To achieve this, the paper proposes a method called cyclic-disentangled self-distillation, which extracts domain-invariant representations (DIR) that capture intrinsic object characteristics. The method disentangles DIR from domain-specific representations without the need for domain-related annotations. It introduces a cyclic-disentangled module to cyclically extract DIR from input visual features, promoting disentanglement without domain-related annotations. Additionally, a self-distillation module is designed to enhance the generalization ability using the DIR as the teacher. The proposed method is evaluated in urban-scene object detection experiments under different weather conditions. The results demonstrate a significant performance gain over baseline methods, particularly in the night-sunny scene where the method outperforms the baselines by 3%. This indicates that the method is effective in enhancing generalization ability. The data and code for the method are available at https://github.com/AmingWu/Single-DGOD.
