The DETR object detection method has revolutionized the field by removing manual components. However, it suffers from slow convergence, leading to high training costs. This paper introduces SAM-DETR, a solution that addresses the convergence issue from two perspectives. First, it projects object queries into the same embedding space as image features, allowing for efficient matching. Second, it searches for salient points with discriminative features to further speed up convergence and improve accuracy. SAM-DETR is easy to implement and has minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior convergence and competitive detection accuracy. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/ZhangGongjie/SAM-DETR.
