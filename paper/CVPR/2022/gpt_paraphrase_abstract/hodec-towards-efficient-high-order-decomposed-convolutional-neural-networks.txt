The paper introduces a new approach called High-Order DEcomposed Convolution (HODEC) for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by performing systematic explorations on the computation inefficiency problem. HODEC aims to reduce both computational and storage costs efficiently. Empirical evaluations on various CNN models and datasets demonstrate that HODEC consistently achieves outstanding compression and acceleration performance. For example, when compressing ResNet-56 on CIFAR-10, HODEC reduces parameters and FLOPs by 67% and 62% respectively, while increasing accuracy by 1.17% compared to the baseline model. Similarly, when compressing ResNet-50 on ImageNet, HODEC achieves a 63% reduction in FLOPs with a 0.31% increase in accuracy compared to the uncompressed model.
