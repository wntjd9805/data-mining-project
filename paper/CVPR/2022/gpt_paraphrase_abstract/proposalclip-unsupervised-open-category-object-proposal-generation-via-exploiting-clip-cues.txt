This study introduces ProposalCLIP, a novel approach for unsupervised open-category object proposal generation in computer vision. Unlike existing methods that rely on bounding box annotations or can only generate proposals for limited object categories, ProposalCLIP can predict proposals for a wide range of object categories without annotations by leveraging CLIP (contrastive language-image pre-training) cues. The authors first analyze CLIP for unsupervised open-category proposal generation and develop an objectness score based on empirical analysis of proposal selection. They then propose a graph-based merging module to address the limitations of CLIP cues and merge fragmented proposals. Additionally, a proposal regression module is presented, which utilizes pseudo labels extracted from CLIP cues to train a lightweight network and further refine proposals. Extensive experiments conducted on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that ProposalCLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in generating proposals. Furthermore, ProposalCLIP exhibits advantages for downstream tasks, such as unsupervised object detection.
