We address the problem of semi-supervised learning, where a limited number of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data are used to train a network. Our focus is on segmenting cellular nuclei in histopathologic images, as collecting labeled data for this task is time-consuming and costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a cross-patch dense contrastive learning framework. The core idea of our approach is to align features from teacher and student networks at both the patch and pixel levels. This alignment promotes compactness within classes and separability between classes, effectively extracting valuable knowledge from the unlabeled data. Additionally, we introduce a novel optimization framework that combines consistency regularization and entropy minimization techniques to address the issue of gradient vanishing. We evaluate our method on two publicly available datasets and achieve superior results compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/zzw-szu/CDCL.
