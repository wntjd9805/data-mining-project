We introduce FLOAT, a framework for multi-object multi-part scene parsing. This task involves detecting object classes and segmenting semantic parts within each object. FLOAT utilizes a factorized label space, enabling independent dense prediction of object category and part attributes. This approach enhances scalability and reduces task complexity compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we propose an inference-time 'zoom' refinement technique that significantly improves segmentation quality, particularly for smaller objects and parts. Our experiments on the Pascal-Part-58 dataset demonstrate that FLOAT achieves an absolute improvement of 2.0% for mean IOU (mIOU) and 4.8% for segmentation quality IOU (sqIOU) compared to state-of-the-art methods. On the larger Pascal-Part-108 dataset, the improvements are 2.1% for mIOU and 3.9% for sqIOU. To create a more comprehensive and challenging dataset, we incorporate previously excluded part attributes and minor parts, resulting in the Pascal-Part-201 dataset. FLOAT achieves significant improvements of 8.6% for mIOU and 7.5% for sqIOU on this new dataset, showcasing its effectiveness in parsing a diverse range of objects and parts.
