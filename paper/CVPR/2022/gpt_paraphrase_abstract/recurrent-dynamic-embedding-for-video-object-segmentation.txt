In this study, we address the limitations of memory-based video object segmentation (VOS) networks that continuously increase memory requirements and introduce noise. We propose a solution called Recurrent Dynamic Embedding (RDE) that creates a memory bank of constant size. Our approach involves generating and updating RDE using the Spatio-temporal Aggregation Module (SAM), which leverages historical information. To prevent error accumulation, we introduce an unbiased guidance loss during training, making SAM more robust for long videos. Additionally, inaccurate predictions in the memory bank affect segmentation, so we design a self-correction strategy to repair mask embeddings of varying qualities. Our method achieves a balance between performance and speed, as demonstrated by extensive experiments. The code for our approach is available at the provided link.
