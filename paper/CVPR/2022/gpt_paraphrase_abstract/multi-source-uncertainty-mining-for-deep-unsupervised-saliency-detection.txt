This paper introduces a new approach for unsupervised deep learning in image salient object detection (SOD) using multiple noisy labels generated by traditional handcrafted SOD methods. The proposed method, called Uncertainty Mining Network (UMNet), utilizes a multi-source uncertainty mining strategy to analyze the commonalities and differences among the noisy labels and infer pixel-wise uncertainty maps for each label. The UMNet consists of Merge-and-Split (MS) modules that recursively analyze the labels. Additionally, the noisy labels are modeled using Gibbs distribution and a weighted uncertainty loss is proposed to train the UMNet alongside the SOD network. This allows the UMNet to select reliable labels for SOD network learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing unsupervised methods and is comparable to fully-supervised state-of-the-art models.
