Current methods of structural re-parameterization (Rep) have shown improvements on simple VGG-style networks. However, these methods re-parameterize all operations, including those that have little impact on the model's performance, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. In order to address this issue, we propose a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method that incorporates the Rep technique into the training process to dynamically evolve the network structures. Our approach identifies the operations that contribute the most to the loss in the network and applies Rep to enhance their representational capacity. Additionally, we introduce a de-parameterization technique to suppress noisy and redundant operations introduced by Rep, resulting in a more compact re-parameterization. Compared to Rep, DyRep is more efficient as it smoothly evolves the network instead of constructing an over-parameterized one. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DyRep, with a 2.04% improvement in accuracy on ImageNet using ResNet-18 and a 22% reduction in runtime compared to the baseline.
