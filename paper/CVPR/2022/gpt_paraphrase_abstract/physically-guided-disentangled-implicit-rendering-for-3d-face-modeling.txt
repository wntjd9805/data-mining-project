This paper introduces a new framework called PhyDIR for creating high-quality 3D face models. The motivation for this research stems from two observations: traditional graphics renderers produce inaccurate results when it comes to realistic imaging, while neural rendering methods produce visually appealing results but lack the ability to perform 3D-aware operations effectively. To address these issues, PhyDIR disentangles the implicit rendering process by incorporating explicit physical guidance. This approach ensures that the framework maintains two important properties: 3D-aware comprehension and high-quality image formation.   To achieve 3D-aware comprehension, PhyDIR utilizes 3D shading and rasterizing modules to control the rendering process. This disentangles the factors of lighting, facial shape, and viewpoint from neural reasoning. Additionally, PhyDIR introduces a novel multi-image shading strategy to overcome the limitations of monocular input, allowing for accurate rendering of lighting variations using neural techniques.   For high-quality image formation, PhyDIR learns an implicit texture representation for the face collection, avoiding the issues associated with ill-posed intrinsic factorization. It then applies a series of consistency losses to ensure robust rendering results.   By combining these disentangled rendering techniques, PhyDIR leverages the strengths of both traditional graphics rendering and neural rendering methods, resulting in improved performance compared to existing explicit and implicit approaches for geometry and texture modeling. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of PhyDIR.
