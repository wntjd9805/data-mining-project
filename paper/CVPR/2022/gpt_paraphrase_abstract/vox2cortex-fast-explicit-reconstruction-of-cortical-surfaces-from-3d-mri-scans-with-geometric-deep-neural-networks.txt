We propose Vox2Cortex, a deep learning-based algorithm, to address the limitations of traditional and deep learning-based methods for reconstructing cortical surfaces from brain MRI scans. Traditional methods have lengthy runtimes, while deep learning-based methods require intricate post-processing. Vox2Cortex directly generates topologically correct, three-dimensional meshes of the cortex boundaries without the need for time-consuming post-processing. It utilizes convolutional and graph convolutional neural networks to deform an initial template to match the folded geometry of the cortex represented by the MRI scan. Extensive experiments on three brain MRI datasets demonstrate that our meshes are as accurate as state-of-the-art methods without the need for resource-intensive post-processing. We work with meshes containing about 168,000 vertices at test time, pushing the boundaries of deep explicit reconstruction methods.
