This study explores a new approach to crowd counting by analyzing the frequency domain instead of the traditional spatial domain. By converting the density map into the frequency domain and utilizing the properties of the characteristic function, a simple, effective, and efficient method is proposed. The theoretical analysis leads to a loss function that is easy to implement, requiring only standard tensor operations during training. It is proven that this loss function serves as an upper bound for the pseudo sup norm metric between the ground truth and the predicted density map across all sub-regions. Furthermore, the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed loss function are demonstrated compared to other loss functions. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets (ShanghaiTech A & B, UCF-QNRF, JHU++, and NWPU) illustrate its competitiveness with the current state-of-the-art methods. The code for this research will be made available at wb-shu/Crowd Counting in the Frequency Domain.
