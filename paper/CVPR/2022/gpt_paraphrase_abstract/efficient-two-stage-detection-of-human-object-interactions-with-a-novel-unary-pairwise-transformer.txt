Recent advances in transformer models for visual data have resulted in significant advancements in recognition and detection tasks. One-stage detection models, such as the Detection Transformer (DETR), have emerged as a new class of models that utilize learnable queries instead of region proposals. These models have dominated the field of human-object interaction (HOI) detection. However, the success of these one-stage HOI detectors can primarily be attributed to the powerful representation capabilities of transformers.Through our research, we have discovered that two-stage HOI detectors equipped with the same transformer can outperform their one-stage counterparts in terms of performance and memory efficiency, while requiring significantly less training time. In light of this, we propose a new two-stage detector called the Unary-Pairwise Transformer. This model takes advantage of unary and pairwise representations for HOIs.Our experiments reveal that the unary and pairwise components of our transformer network specialize in different tasks. The unary component primarily increases the scores of positive examples, while the pairwise component decreases the scores of negative examples. We evaluate our method on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.During inference, our model with ResNet50 achieves near real-time performance on a single GPU.
