This paper addresses the challenge of autonomous driving systems adapting to an ever-changing environment. Current driving datasets do not accurately represent the dynamic nature of the real world. To address this, we introduce SHIFT, a synthetic dataset for autonomous driving that includes various shifts such as changes in cloudiness, rain and fog intensity, time of day, and vehicle and pedestrian density. SHIFT includes a comprehensive sensor suite and annotations for multiple perception tasks, allowing researchers to investigate how perception systems perform under different levels of domain shift. This dataset and benchmark toolkit are publicly available at www.vis.xyz/shift.
