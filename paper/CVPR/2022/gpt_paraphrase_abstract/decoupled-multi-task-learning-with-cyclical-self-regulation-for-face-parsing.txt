This paper investigates the underlying factors that contribute to common failures in face parsing, such as spatial inconsistency and boundary confusion, in the current state-of-the-art method. To address these issues, we propose a new approach called De-coupled Multi-task Learning with Cyclical Self-Regulation (DML-CSR) for face parsing. Our method involves designing a multi-task model that includes face parsing, binary edge detection, and category edge detection. These tasks share low-level encoder weights but do not have high-level interactions, allowing auxiliary modules to be separated from the main network during inference. To resolve spatial inconsistency, we introduce a dynamic dual graph convolutional network that captures global contextual information without the need for additional pooling operations. To handle boundary confusion in single and multiple face scenarios, we leverage binary and category edge detection to simultaneously obtain geometric structure and fine-grained semantic clues of human faces. Additionally, we propose cyclical self-regulation to prevent noisy labels from negatively impacting model generalization during training. This involves self-ensembling multiple model instances to create a new model, which is then used to self-distill subsequent models through alternating iterations.Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Helen, CelebAMask-HQ, and Lapa datasets.
