This paper presents a new approach for recovering global shutter (GS) video from rolling shutter (RS) cameras. Existing methods often generate intermediate GS frames through image warping, resulting in black holes and motion artifacts. To address this issue, the proposed architecture incorporates occlusion reasoning, motion compensation, and temporal abstraction. First, a bilateral motion field is estimated to warp the RS frames to a common GS frame. Then, a refinement scheme with bilateral occlusion masks is used to synthesize high-quality GS video frames at arbitrary times. Additionally, an approximated bilateral motion field model is derived as a simple yet effective initialization for related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual quality.
