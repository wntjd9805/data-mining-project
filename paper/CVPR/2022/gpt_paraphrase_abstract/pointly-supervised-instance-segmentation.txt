We present a simple method for gathering weak supervision in instance segmentation through a point annotation scheme. In addition to collecting bounding boxes, we also collect binary labels for a set of points uniformly sampled within each bounding box. We demonstrate that existing instance segmentation models developed for full mask supervision can be effectively trained using our point-based supervision scheme. Surprisingly, Mask R-CNN trained on various datasets with only 10 randomly annotated points per object achieves 94%â€“98% of its performance with full supervision, establishing a strong baseline for weakly-supervised instance segmentation. Our new point annotation scheme is approximately 5 times faster than annotating full object masks, making high-quality instance segmentation more feasible in practical applications.  Inspired by the point-based annotation approach, we propose a modification to the PointRend instance segmentation module. In this new architecture, called ImplicitPointRend, parameters are generated for a function that predicts the final point-level mask for each object. Implicit PointRend is more intuitive and utilizes a single point-level mask loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this new module is better suited for point-based supervision.
