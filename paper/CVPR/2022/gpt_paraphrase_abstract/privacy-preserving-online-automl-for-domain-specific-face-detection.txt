Despite the advancements in general face detection, the tuning of hyper-parameters and architectures remains crucial for the performance of a domain-specific face detector. Existing AutoML methods can expedite this process but either require starting from scratch for new scenarios or do not take data privacy into account. To address this, we propose a new AutoML approach from a platform perspective. In this approach, new datasets are continuously added to the platform, and for each dataset, a recommended architecture and hyper-parameter configuration are provided to train the optimal face detector. However, two major challenges arise: (1) how to predict the best configuration for a given dataset without accessing its raw images due to privacy concerns, and (2) how to continually enhance the AutoML algorithm based on previous tasks to improve future ones. To tackle these challenges, we introduce "HyperFD," a privacy-preserving online AutoML framework for face detection. Our framework includes a novel meta-feature representation and learning paradigm for datasets. With HyperFD, each local task can effectively leverage the learning experience from previous tasks without uploading raw images to the platform. Additionally, the meta-feature extractor is continuously learned to strike a better balance between bias and variance. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our design.
