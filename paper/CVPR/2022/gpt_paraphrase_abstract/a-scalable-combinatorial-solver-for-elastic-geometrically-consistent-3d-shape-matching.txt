We introduce a scalable algorithm for globally optimizing mappings between 3D shapes. We utilize a formalism proposed by Windheuser et al. that formulates shape matching as an integer linear program. However, the previous formulation had limited practical use due to its complex constraints and large size. To overcome this, we propose a new primal heuristic and Lagrange dual problem that significantly improves computation speed. As a result, we can now handle shapes with a much larger number of triangles than before. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on various datasets, including the challenging task of matching partial shapes. Our code is publicly available at http://github.com/paul0noah/sm-comb.
