A new approach for face restoration is proposed in this study to address the limitations of existing models. While current methods have made progress in generating high-quality faces, they often fail to preserve facial features accurately, compromising the authenticity of the reconstructed faces. This issue arises from the delicate balance between two sub-tasks of face restoration: face generation and face reconstruction. By improving both aspects, the proposed model aims to achieve better results.  Additionally, a new evaluation metric is introduced to measure the models' ability to preserve the identity in restored faces. This metric proves to have a higher correlation with user preference. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple face restoration benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, a user study confirms that our model produces higher quality faces while better preserving identity in 86.4% of cases compared to existing methods.
