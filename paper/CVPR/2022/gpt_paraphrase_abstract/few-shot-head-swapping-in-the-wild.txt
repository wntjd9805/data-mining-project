The presented method in this study achieves highly successful head swapping results in various scenes. Head swapping, which involves seamlessly placing a source head onto a target body, is crucial for entertainment purposes. While face swapping has received significant attention, head swapping has been largely unexplored, especially in the few-shot setting. This task is particularly challenging due to the specific requirements of head modeling and background blending. In this paper, we introduce the Head Swapper (HeSer), which enables few-shot head swapping in real-world scenarios through two carefully designed modules. The first module, called the Head2Head Aligner, transfers pose and expression information from the target head to the source head by considering multi-scale information. The second module, the Head2Scene Blender, addresses challenges such as variations in skin color and mismatches between the head and the background during the swapping process. It modifies facial skin color and fills in gaps on the background surrounding the head. This seamless blending is achieved through a Semantic-Guided Color Reference Creation procedure and a Blending UNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior results.
