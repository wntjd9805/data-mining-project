Long-tail object detection faces challenges in accurately detecting objects from tail categories. The main issue causing this problem is the imbalanced distribution of weight norms in the classifier. This distribution leads to an ill-conditioned decision boundary for categories with small weight norms when using conventional softmax cross-entropy loss. To address this, we propose maximizing the cosine similarity between the learned feature and the weight vector of the target category instead of their inner-product. The decision boundary between any two categories is determined by the angular bisector of their weight vectors. However, an equal decision boundary is not optimal as it reduces the model's sensitivity to different categories. We believe that categories with diverse data should occupy a larger area in the classification space, while categories with limited data diversity should occupy a slightly smaller space. To achieve this, we introduce the Category-Aware Angular Margin Loss (C2AM Loss), which incorporates an adaptive angular margin between categories. The margin between two categories is proportional to the ratio of their classifiers' weight norms, pushing the decision boundary slightly towards the category with a smaller weight norm. Our experiments on the LVIS dataset demonstrate that C2AM Loss improves average precision (AP) by 4.9-5.2 compared to baseline detectors and backbones.
