Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a valuable tool in bioengineering tasks. However, the image quality of OCTA is often compromised by Bulk Motion Artifacts (BMA), which are caused by subject micromotion and appear as bright stripes surrounded by blurred areas. Existing methods for BMA removal approach it as a learning-based image inpainting problem, but they require a large number of training samples with complex annotations. Moreover, these methods overlook the valuable structural and appearance information carried in the BMA stripe region. To address these challenges, this paper presents a self-supervised content-aware BMA removal model. First, the model extracts gradient-based structural information and appearance features from the BMA area, enhancing connectivity. Second, the model is trained in a self-supervised manner using easily collected defective masks. During training, only the clear areas are used, while the BMA areas are used for inference. By referencing the structural information and appearance features from the noisy image, our model effectively removes larger BMAs and produces improved visual results. Importantly, our method only requires 2D images with defective masks, making it more efficient. Experimental results on OCTA of mouse cortex demonstrate that our model successfully removes most BMAs, even those with large sizes and inconsistent intensities that previous methods fail to address.
