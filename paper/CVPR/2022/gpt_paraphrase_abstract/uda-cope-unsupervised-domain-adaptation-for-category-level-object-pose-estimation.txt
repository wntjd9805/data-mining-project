We present UDA-COPE, an unsupervised domain adaptation method for category-level object pose estimation. Traditionally, obtaining ground-truth labels for pose estimation is costly and time-consuming. To address this issue, our approach utilizes a teacher-student self-supervised learning scheme that does not rely on target domain pose labels. Additionally, we introduce a bidirectional filtering technique between the predicted normalized object coordinate space (NOCS) map and observed point cloud. This enhances the robustness of our teacher network in the target domain and provides more reliable pseudo labels for the student network training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both quantitatively and qualitatively. Remarkably, our proposed approach achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing existing methods that rely on ground-truth labels, despite not utilizing such labels in the target domain.
