The task of action-driven stochastic human motion prediction is introduced in this study. The goal is to predict multiple plausible future motions based on a sequence of action labels and a short motion history. This task is different from previous works that either predict motions without considering specific action categories or only follow a single action label. There are two main challenges in addressing this task: ensuring smooth transitions between different actions and accounting for the varying length of predicted motions based on the action sequence. Since training data cannot realistically cover diverse action transitions and motion lengths, an effective training strategy is proposed. This strategy involves combining multiple motions from different actions and introducing a weak form of supervision to encourage smooth transitions. A VAE-based model is then designed, which takes into account both the observed motion and the action label sequence to generate multiple plausible future motions of varying length. The approach is tested with two different temporal encoding models, namely RNNs and Transformers, demonstrating its generality. The proposed approach outperforms baseline models that adapt existing motion generation methods and stochastic human motion prediction approaches to the new task of action-driven stochastic motion prediction. The code for the approach is available at https://github.com/wei-mao-2019/WAT.
