This paper proposes a method for approximating the output of probabilistic ensemble models used for dense image prediction tasks. The method utilizes a sparse-structured multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is generated by a convolutional neural network that predicts the mean and covariance of the distribution. The inverse covariance is parameterized by a sparsely structured Cholesky matrix. Similar to distillation approaches, the proposed method trains a single network to maximize the probability of samples from pre-trained probabilistic models, specifically a fixed ensemble of networks. Once trained, the compact representation generated by the method allows for efficient sampling of spatially correlated samples from the approximated output distribution. An important aspect of this approach is that it explicitly captures the uncertainty and structured correlations in the predictions through a formal distribution, rather than relying solely on sampling. This enables direct introspection of the model and visualization of the learned structure. Additionally, the proposed formulation offers two additional benefits: estimation of sample probability and the ability to introduce arbitrary spatial conditioning during testing. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the task of monocular depth estimation. The results show that the advantages of the method are obtained while achieving comparable quantitative performance.
