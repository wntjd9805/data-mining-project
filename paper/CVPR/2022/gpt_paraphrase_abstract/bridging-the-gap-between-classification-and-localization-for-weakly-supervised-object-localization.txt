Weakly supervised object localization is a task that involves identifying the region of a target object in an image using limited supervision, such as image-level labels. Most existing methods rely on class activation maps (CAM) to generate localization maps. However, CAMs only highlight the most distinctive parts of the target object, rather than the entire object region. This study explores the discrepancy between classification and localization, focusing on the misalignment between the input feature and the class-specific weight. It is observed that this misalignment hinders the activation of CAM in less discriminative areas that still belong to the target object. To address this issue, the proposed method aims to align feature directions with the class-specific weight. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through its superior localization performance on the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks.
