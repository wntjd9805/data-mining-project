Unsupervised semantic segmentation seeks to identify object groupings in images without external supervision. However, this process can lead to ambiguity in the segmentation results. While existing methods ignore this ambiguity, we believe it should be embraced and aim for hierarchical grouping consistency in unsupervised segmentation. To achieve this, we approach unsupervised segmentation as a pixel-wise feature learning problem. Our approach focuses on learning representations that reveal grouping at any level consistently. We enforce spatial consistency by utilizing co-segmentation among multiple views of the same image and ensure semantic consistency by using clustering transformers between coarse- and fine-grained features. Our proposed method, Hierarchical Segment Grouping (HSG), is the first data-driven unsupervised hierarchical semantic segmentation method. HSG surpasses existing unsupervised segmentation methods by a significant margin on various object- and scene-centric benchmarks, thanks to its ability to capture visual similarity and statistical co-occurrences.
