This paper introduces a method for training a generative adversarial network (GAN) based single image super-resolution (SISR) model that can generate realistic details while minimizing visual artifacts. The method utilizes the observation that the local statistics of artifact areas differ from those of perceptually friendly details. By discriminating between GAN-generated artifacts and realistic details, an artifact map is generated to regulate and stabilize the model training process. The proposed locally discriminative learning (LDL) method is simple yet effective, and can be easily integrated into existing SISR methods to enhance their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LDL outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based SISR methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The code and models for LDL are available at https://github.com/csjliang/LDL.
