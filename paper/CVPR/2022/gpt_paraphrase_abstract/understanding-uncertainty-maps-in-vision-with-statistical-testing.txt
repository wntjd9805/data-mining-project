In many vision and machine learning applications, it is important to have quantitative measures of confidence intervals and uncertainties for model predictions. While mechanisms for providing such measures for deep neural network (DNN) models are slowly emerging, the literature lacks guidance on how to perform statistical tests using the uncertainties produced by these models, especially in cases where high-resolution images are involved. This paper introduces a method that combines Random Field theory (RFT) with DNN tools to overcome computational challenges and enable efficient hypothesis testing for uncertainty maps in vision tasks. The proposed framework is shown to be viable through various experiments.
