Current image cropping techniques primarily rely on either anchor evaluation methods or coordinate regression methods. However, these approaches have limitations. Pre-defined anchors struggle to encompass globally optimal crops, while regression methods overlook cropping diversity. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective by treating image cropping as a set prediction problem. We employ multiple learnable anchors to regress a set of crops, which are then compared to labeled good crops. A classifier is trained using the matching results to select a valid subset from all predictions. This approach combines the strengths of previous methods while addressing their weaknesses by incorporating globality and diversity. Nevertheless, the set prediction method introduces a discrepancy between validity labels and crops. To tackle this issue, we propose two methods to smooth the validity labels. The first method utilizes crop qualities as direct guidance and is suitable for datasets with densely labeled quality information. The second method, based on self-distillation, can be applied to datasets with sparsely labeled data. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.
