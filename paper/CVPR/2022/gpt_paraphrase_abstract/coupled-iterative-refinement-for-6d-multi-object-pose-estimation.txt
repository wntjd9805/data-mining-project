We propose a novel approach to the task of estimating the 6D pose of multiple objects using known 3D objects and an input image. Our method involves an end-to-end differentiable architecture that incorporates geometric knowledge. By iteratively refining both pose and correspondence in a tightly coupled manner, we are able to effectively remove outliers and improve accuracy. To refine the pose, we introduce a new differentiable layer called Bidirectional Depth-Augmented Perspective-N-Point (BD-PnP), which solves an optimization problem. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on standard benchmarks for 6D object pose estimation. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/Coupled-Iterative-Refinement.
