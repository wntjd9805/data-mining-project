The active contour model has shown promise in polygon-based object extraction, especially with recent advancements in deep learning. This study introduces a new approach called the contour vibration network (CVNet) for automatically delineating building boundaries. Unlike previous contour models, CVNet is inspired by the principles of force and motion in a contour string. By applying infinitesimal analysis and Newton's second law, the researchers derive a mathematical model for the spatial-temporal vibration of object shapes, which can be represented as a second-order differential equation. To make the dynamic model more concrete, the vibration model is transformed into the space of image features, and the equation coefficients are reparameterized as learnable states from the feature domain. The contour changes are then evolved progressively by solving the contour vibration equation. This process forms a closed-loop end-to-end network that combines polygon contour evolution and model optimization. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that CVNet outperforms other baselines and state-of-the-art methods for polygon-based building extraction.
