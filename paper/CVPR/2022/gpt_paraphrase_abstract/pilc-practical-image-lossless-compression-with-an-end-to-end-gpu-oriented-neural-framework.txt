We propose PILC, an image lossless compression framework that achieves a throughput of 200 MB/s for compression and decompression using a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. This is 10 times faster than the previous most efficient algorithm. PILC combines an auto-regressive model and VQ-VAE in an AI codec, which performs well in lightweight settings. We also design a low complexity entropy coder that complements our codec effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms PNG by 30% in multiple datasets. This advancement is a crucial step towards the commercial application of AI compression.
