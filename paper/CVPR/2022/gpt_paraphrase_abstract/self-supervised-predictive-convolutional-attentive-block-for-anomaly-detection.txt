Anomaly detection is often approached as a problem of classifying one class, where models can only learn from normal training data but are evaluated on both normal and abnormal test data. One category of successful anomaly detection methods involves predicting masked information, such as patches or future frames, and using the reconstruction error as a measure of abnormality. In contrast to existing methods, we propose a novel self-supervised predictive architectural building block that incorporates reconstruction-based functionality. This block, which consists of a convolutional layer with dilated filters and a channel attention module, is designed to minimize the reconstruction error within the masked area of the receptive field. We demonstrate the versatility of our block by integrating it into various state-of-the-art anomaly detection frameworks for image and video data, and provide empirical evidence of significant performance improvements on MVTec AD, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets.
