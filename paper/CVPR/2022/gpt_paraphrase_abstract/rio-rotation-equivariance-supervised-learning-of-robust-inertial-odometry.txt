This study presents a new approach called rotation-equivariance for training inertial odometry models. The use of this self-supervised scheme provides a strong supervisory signal during both the training and inference stages. By incorporating rotation-equivariance, the model becomes less dependent on large amounts of labeled data, allowing for the use of unlabeled data for model updates. Additionally, an adaptive Test-Time Training (TTT) technique is proposed to improve the generalizability of the inertial odometry model to unseen data by considering uncertainty estimations. Experimental results demonstrate that the Rotation-equivariance-supervised Inertial Odometry (RIO) model trained with only 30% of the data performs comparably to a model trained with the entire dataset. Furthermore, the adaptive TTT approach enhances the performance of the models in all scenarios, achieving more than a 25% improvement in some cases. The code and dataset used in this study are publicly available on our website.
