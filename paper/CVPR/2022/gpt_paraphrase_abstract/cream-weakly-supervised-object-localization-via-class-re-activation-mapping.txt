Weakly Supervised Object Localization (WSOL) is a technique used to locate objects in images using only image-level supervision. Previous methods, such as Class Activation Mapping (CAM), have focused on the most discriminative parts of an object, resulting in incomplete localization. This issue arises from the mixing of activation values between less discriminative foreground regions and the background. To address this problem, we propose a new approach called Class RE-Activation Mapping (CREAM). CREAM utilizes clustering-based techniques to enhance the activation values of integral object regions. We introduce class-specific foreground and background context embeddings as cluster centroids and use a CAM-guided momentum preservation strategy to learn these embeddings during training. During the inference stage, we formulate re-activation mapping as a parameter estimation problem under a Gaussian Mixture Model. This can be solved using an unsupervised Expectation-Maximization based soft-clustering algorithm. By integrating CREAM into existing WSOL methods, we significantly improve their performance. In fact, CREAM achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as CUB, ILSVRC, and OpenImages. The code for CREAM is available at https://github.com/Jazzcharles/CREAM.
