Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for self-driving cars, and public benchmarks have been established to address this need. While state-of-the-art methods are impressive, they lack the ability to predict off-road scenarios and their applicability in real-world city environments remains unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that these methods fail to generalize to new scenes. To address this issue, we propose a method that utilizes adversarial scene generation to automatically create realistic scenes that challenge existing prediction models. Our approach employs a simple yet effective generative model that incorporates atomic scene generation functions and adheres to physical constraints. Our experiments reveal that over 60% of scenes from current benchmarks can be modified to induce off-road predictions by existing methods. Furthermore, we validate the realism of the generated scenes by their existence in the real world and demonstrate that they can enhance the robustness of existing models, resulting in a significant 30-40% reduction in off-road prediction rates. The code for our method is available online at https://s-attack.github.io/.
