This study introduces point-level region contrast, a self-supervised pre-training technique for object detection. The approach takes into account the importance of both localization and recognition in detection tasks. While accurate localization requires pixel- or point-level models, correct recognition relies on a holistic, region-level understanding of objects. To incorporate both perspectives, the proposed approach performs contrastive learning by sampling individual point pairs from different regions. This method is more robust to changes in input region quality compared to aggregated representations per region. Additionally, it allows for the implicit improvement of initial region assignments through online knowledge distillation during training. These advantages are particularly valuable when dealing with imperfect regions in unsupervised settings. Experimental results demonstrate that point-level region contrast outperforms state-of-the-art pre-training methods for object detection and segmentation across various tasks and datasets. The study includes extensive ablation studies and visualizations to enhance comprehension. The code for the approach will be made available.
