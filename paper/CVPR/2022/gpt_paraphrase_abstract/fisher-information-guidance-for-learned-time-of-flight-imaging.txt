In this paper, we present a framework for improving Indirect Time-of-Flight (ToF) imaging, which is commonly used due to its cost-effectiveness and spatial resolution advantages. However, ToF imaging often suffers from larger errors and lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly in scenarios with strong ambient light or long distances. To address this issue, we propose a Fisher-information guided approach that optimizes both the coding functions (light modulation and sensor demodulation) and the reconstruction network of iToF imaging. Our method incorporates a discriminative Fisher loss to supervise the optimization process. By considering various real factors and constraints, such as light-falloff with distance and the physical implementability of coding functions, we develop a differentiable model of the physical imaging process. This model is then combined with a dual-branch depth reconstruction neural network, allowing our method to learn the optimal iToF imaging system in an end-to-end manner. We extensively validate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and prototype experiments.
