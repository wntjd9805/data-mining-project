Recent advancements in neural function have made significant progress in reconstructing high-quality 3D shapes. However, these methods are limited in their ability to represent complex shapes with multiple layers and non-watertight surfaces. This limitation not only requires tedious data processing but also hinders the representation of general object shapes in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called General Implicit Function for 3D Shape (GIFS). Instead of dividing the space into inside and outside regions, GIFS models the relationships between every pair of points in the shape. By encoding whether two points are separated by any surface, GIFS can represent general shapes, including those with non-watertight surfaces and multi-layer structures. Our experiments on ShapeNet demonstrate that GIFS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality, rendering efficiency, and visual fidelity.
