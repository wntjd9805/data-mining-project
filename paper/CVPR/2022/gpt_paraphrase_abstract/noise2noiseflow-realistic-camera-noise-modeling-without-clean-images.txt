Image noise modeling is a well-known problem in computer vision, with various applications. Previous attempts at modeling noise, such as simple additive white Gaussian noise or the heteroscedastic Gaussian noise model, have limitations in capturing the complex behavior of camera sensor noise. Recently, more advanced learning-based models have been proposed, but their reliance on supervised data makes them challenging to use due to the lack of ground-truth images. This paper introduces a framework that trains a noise model and a denoiser simultaneously using only pairs of noisy images, without the need for noisy/clean paired data. The framework is applied to the training of the Noise Flow architecture, and the results demonstrate superior noise synthesis and density estimation compared to previous signal-processing-based noise models. The trained denoiser also outperforms both supervised and weakly supervised baseline denoising approaches. These findings highlight the significant improvements achieved by jointly training a denoiser and a noise model.
