Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (ReID) has been extensively studied to address the challenges posed by domain gaps. However, existing methods assume that all target domain data is available at once, which is not practical for real-world streaming data. To address this limitation, we propose a new task called Lifelong Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (LUDA) person ReID. This task aims to continuously adapt the model to unlabeled data in the target environments while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We introduce CLUDA-ReID, an effective scheme that combines anti-forgetting and adaptation. Our approach includes a meta-based Coordinated Data Replay strategy to replay old data and update the network, ensuring coordinated optimization for both adaptation and memorization. Additionally, we propose Relational Consistency Learning for old knowledge distillation to align with retrieval-based tasks. We evaluate our approach in two scenarios: stationary target streams and dynamic target streams. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CLUDA-ReID in both scenarios.
