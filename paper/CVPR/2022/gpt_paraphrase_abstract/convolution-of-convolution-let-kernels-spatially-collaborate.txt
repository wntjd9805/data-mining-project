In the retina and convolution layers, neurons and kernels are organized differently. In the visual pathway, neurons are arranged spatially with local connections, while in convolution layers, kernels are placed individually along the channel dimension. Our proposal is to introduce a "convolution of convolution" approach, where kernels in a layer collaborate spatially. This allows for additional transformations and joint learning of kernels, instead of isolated learning. This method incurs minimal additional costs during training and can be easily re-parameterized to regular convolution for testing. It improves performance in tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation, particularly when larger receptive fields are required. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/Genera1Z/ConvolutionOfConvolution.
