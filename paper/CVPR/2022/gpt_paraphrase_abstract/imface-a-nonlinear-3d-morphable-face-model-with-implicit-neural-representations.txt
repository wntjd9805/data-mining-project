This paper introduces a new 3D morphable face model called ImFace, which aims to improve the representation of 3D faces for computer vision and graphics applications. Existing studies face challenges in accurately capturing identity and expression clues due to data discretization and model linearity. ImFace addresses this by creating a nonlinear and continuous space using implicit neural representations. It utilizes two separate deformation fields to model complex shapes associated with identities and expressions. Additionally, it implements an enhanced learning strategy to allow for more diverse changes in expression embeddings. The paper also introduces a Neural Blend-Field that adaptively blends local fields to learn sophisticated details. To overcome the limitation of requiring watertight input in implicit representations, the authors propose an effective pre-processing pipeline. This enables ImFace to work with common facial surfaces for the first time. The effectiveness of ImFace is demonstrated through extensive experiments. Overall, ImFace offers a superior approach to representing 3D faces, providing more accurate identity and expression information.
