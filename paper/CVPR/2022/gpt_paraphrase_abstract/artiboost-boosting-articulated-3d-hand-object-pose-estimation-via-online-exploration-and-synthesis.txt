The problem of estimating the 3D pose of a hand holding an object from a single RGB image is challenging due to its ambiguity. Existing datasets lack the necessary diversity of hand poses, object types, and camera viewpoints. Data synthesis can address this issue by generating diverse hand-object interactions, but effectively learning from synthetic data remains a challenge. To tackle these problems, we propose ArtiBoost, a lightweight method for online data enhancement. ArtiBoost covers diverse hand-object poses and camera viewpoints by sampling in a Composited hand-object Configuration and Viewpoint space. It enriches the current discernable items by incorporating loss-feedback and sample re-weighting. ArtiBoost performs data exploration and synthesis within a learning pipeline, blending synthetic data with real-world source data for training. We apply ArtiBoost to a simple learning baseline network and observe improved performance on various hand-object benchmarks. Our models and code can be accessed at https://github.com/lixiny/ArtiBoost.
