Flagship smartphone cameras now commonly use a specialized neural image signal processor (ISP) to transform noisy raw sensor images into the final processed output. However, training ISP networks for night mode requires large-scale datasets of image pairs consisting of a noisy raw image taken with a short exposure and high ISO gain, and a ground truth low-noise raw image taken with a long exposure and low ISO, which has been processed through the ISP. Capturing these image pairs is time-consuming and requires careful setup to ensure proper alignment. Additionally, the ground truth images often suffer from motion blur due to the long exposure.  To address these challenges, we propose a method that synthesizes nighttime images from daytime images. Daytime images are easier to capture, have lower noise (even on smartphone cameras), and are less prone to motion blur. We present a processing framework that transforms daytime raw images to resemble realistic nighttime raw images with varying levels of noise. This framework allows us to generate aligned pairs of noisy and clean nighttime images efficiently.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our synthesis framework by training neural ISPs for night mode rendering. Moreover, we show that using our synthetic nighttime images, combined with a small amount of real data (e.g., 5% to 10%), achieves performance almost equivalent to training exclusively on real nighttime images. Our dataset and code are publicly available for further research.  In Figure 1, we provide visual examples of our day-to-night image synthesis framework. We compare different synthesis methods and show that our neural night mode ISP, trained using our synthetic nighttime images, produces more accurate results compared to models trained on dimmed daytime images or night images synthesized using CycleGAN. The inset in the figure shows the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) in decibels as a quantitative measure of the image quality.  Overall, our approach offers a practical solution for training neural ISPs for night mode by synthesizing nighttime images from easily obtainable daytime images. This not only reduces the burden of collecting paired nighttime data but also improves the accuracy of the trained models.
