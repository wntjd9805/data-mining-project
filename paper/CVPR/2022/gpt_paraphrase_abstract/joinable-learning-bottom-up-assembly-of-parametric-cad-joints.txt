This paper presents JoinABLe, a learning-based method for assembling 3D parts in computer-aided design (CAD) software. JoinABLe utilizes weak supervision from standard parametric CAD files, without relying on object class labels or human guidance. The method makes predictions over a graph representation of solid models, achieving an accuracy of 79.53%, which is close to human performance (80%). Additionally, the Fusion 360 Gallery assembly dataset is released, providing comprehensive information on joints, contact surfaces, holes, and the assembly graph structure.
