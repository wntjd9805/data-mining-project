We present a technique to simultaneously estimate the 3D motion, shape, and appearance of objects that are highly motion-blurred in a video. Our approach involves modeling the blurred appearance of a fast-moving object by parameterizing its various properties such as position, rotation, velocity, acceleration, bounces, shape, and texture over a predefined time window covering multiple frames. By utilizing differentiable rendering, we can estimate these parameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error in the input video. This is achieved through backpropagation in a rendering pipeline that takes into account motion blur by averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. Additionally, we estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization process. To handle abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory using piece-wise polynomials and accurately estimate the bounce time at sub-frame level. Through experiments on widely used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches in terms of fast moving object deblurring and 3D reconstruction.
