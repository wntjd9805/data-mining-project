Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for understanding activities. While recent one-stage and two-stage methods have shown promising results, the task of identifying interactive human-object pairs remains challenging. Existing methods struggle to accurately extract these pairs and often produce redundant negative pairs. This study introduces a previously overlooked bimodal prior called "interactiveness field" that indicates the likelihood of a pair being interactive or non-interactive. The interactiveness field is learned based on the observation that non-interactive pairs are more frequent than interactive pairs. To ensure the compatibility of the learned field with real HOI images, new energy constraints are proposed that consider the cardinality and difference in interactiveness between interactive and non-interactive pairs. This approach enables the detection of more precise pairs and significantly improves HOI detection performance. The proposed method is validated on popular benchmarks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.
