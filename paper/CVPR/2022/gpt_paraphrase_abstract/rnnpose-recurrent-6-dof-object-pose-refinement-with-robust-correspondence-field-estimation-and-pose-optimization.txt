This paper presents a novel framework for refining the estimation of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) object pose from a single image. The proposed framework utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) to address the challenges of inaccurate initial poses and occlusions. The object pose refinement is formulated as a non-linear least squares problem, with the estimated correspondence field between a rendered image and the observed image serving as the basis. The problem is then solved using a differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, allowing for end-to-end training. The refinement process alternates between estimating the correspondence field and refining the object pose in each iteration. To enhance the robustness to occlusion, a consistency-check mechanism is introduced, which leverages learned descriptors of the 3D model and observed 2D images to downweight unreliable correspondences during pose optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on LINEMOD, Occlusion-LINEMOD, and YCB-Video datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.
