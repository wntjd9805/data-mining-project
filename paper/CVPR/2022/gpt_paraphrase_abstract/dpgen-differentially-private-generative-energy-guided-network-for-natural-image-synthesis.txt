Data sharing is hindered by privacy concerns surrounding sensitive datasets. To address this issue, differentially private generative models have been used to generate synthetic data. However, these models are typically limited to generating low-resolution images due to noisy gradients. In this study, we propose DPGEN, a network model that can synthesize high-resolution natural images while maintaining differential privacy. DPGEN utilizes an energy-guided network trained on sanitized data to guide the generation process using Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Unlike existing methods that can only generate low-resolution images, DPGEN can produce differentially private synthetic images with resolutions up to 128 Ã— 128, exhibiting superior visual quality and data utility. The code for DPGEN is publicly available at https://github.com/chiamuyu/DPGEN.
