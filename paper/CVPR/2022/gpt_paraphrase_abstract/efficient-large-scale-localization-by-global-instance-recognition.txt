We propose a new large-scale localization framework that is efficient and accurate. Our framework is based on recognizing buildings, which are both discriminative for coarse localization and robust for fine localization. We assign each building instance a global ID and perform pixel-wise recognition of these instances in the localization process. For coarse localization, we use an efficient reference search strategy to find candidates progressively from the local map. For fine localization, we use predicted labels for instance-wise feature detection and matching, allowing our model to focus on fewer but more robust keypoints. Our experiments on long-term large-scale localization datasets show that our method consistently outperforms previous approaches in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
