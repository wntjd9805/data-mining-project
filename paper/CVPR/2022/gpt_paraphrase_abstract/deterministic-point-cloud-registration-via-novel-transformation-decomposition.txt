This study focuses on the removal of outliers and estimation of a rigid transformation with 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) using a set of putative 3D-3D point correspondences. The traditional approach decomposes the 6 DOF into separate 3-DOF rotations and translations, but the non-linearity of the rotation component limits efficiency, especially with a large number of correspondences. In contrast, the proposed method decomposes the 6 DOF into (2+1) and (1+2) DOF, representing rotation axis and displacement along the axis, as well as rotation angle and displacement orthogonal to the axis, respectively. The method utilizes a two-stage strategy based on inlier set maximization, using branch and bound to search for the (2+1) DOF and then the remaining (1+2) DOF. This approach leads to a deterministic method with low computational complexity. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, which is also more efficient than approaches with comparable accuracy and robustness.
