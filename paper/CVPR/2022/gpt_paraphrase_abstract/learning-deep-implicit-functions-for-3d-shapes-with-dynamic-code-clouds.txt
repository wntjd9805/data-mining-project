The Deep Implicit Function (DIF) has become popular for representing 3D shapes efficiently. Current methods use local latent codes to capture geometry details by discretizing the space into a regular 3D grid or octree. However, the constraint of regular code positions limits their representation ability. To address this, we propose DCC-DIF, which associates local codes with learnable position vectors that can be dynamically optimized. We also introduce a code position loss to guide the distribution of local codes around complex geometric details. Compared to previous methods, DCC-DIF represents 3D shapes more efficiently with fewer local codes and improves reconstruction quality. Experimental results show that DCC-DIF outperforms previous methods. The code and data for our method are available at https://github.com/lity20/DCCDIF.
