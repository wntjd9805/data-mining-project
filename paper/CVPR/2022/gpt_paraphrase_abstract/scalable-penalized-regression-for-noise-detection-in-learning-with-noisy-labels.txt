This paper presents a framework for detecting and removing noisy data in neural networks trained with noisy labels. The proposed framework utilizes a penalized regression model to identify noisy data based on the mean shift parameters. To handle large datasets, a split algorithm is introduced to divide the training set into smaller subsets that can be processed in parallel using the penalized regression model. The framework, called Scalable Penalized Regression (SPR), is designed to accurately identify noisy data. Additionally, SPR is combined with a semi-supervised algorithm to leverage the support of noisy data as unlabeled data. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The code and pretrained models are publicly available for further exploration.
