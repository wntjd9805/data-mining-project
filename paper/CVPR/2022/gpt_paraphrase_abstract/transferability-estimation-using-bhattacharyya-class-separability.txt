Transfer learning has become a widely used technique in computer vision to leverage pre-trained models. However, it is challenging to determine which pre-trained models are suitable for a specific target task without computationally expensive fine-tuning. Conversely, it is also difficult to determine the transferability of a pre-trained model to different tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Gaussian Bhattacharyya Coefficient (GBC) to quantify the transferability between a source model and a target dataset. Our approach involves embedding target images into the feature space defined by the source model and representing them using per-class Gaussians. We then estimate the pairwise class separability using the Bhattacharyya coefficient, providing a simple and effective measure of how well the source model transfers to the target task. We evaluate the effectiveness of GBC on image classification tasks, particularly in the context of dataset and architecture selection. Additionally, we conduct experiments on the more complex task of semantic segmentation transferability estimation. The results demonstrate that GBC outperforms existing transferability metrics in the semantic segmentation settings and matches the performance of top methods for dataset transferability in image classification. Furthermore, GBC performs best in architecture selection problems for image classification.
