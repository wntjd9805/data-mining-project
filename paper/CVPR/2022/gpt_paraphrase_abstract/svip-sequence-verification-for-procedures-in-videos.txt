This paper presents a new task of sequence verification that aims to differentiate positive video pairs that perform the same action sequence from negative pairs that undergo step-level transformations but still perform the same task. This task is challenging as it is conducted in an open-set setting without prior action detection or segmentation, requiring event-level or frame-level annotations. To address this, the authors reorganize two publicly available action-related datasets with a step-procedure-task structure. Additionally, they collect a scripted video dataset that includes various step-level transformations in chemical experiments to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of different methods. They introduce a novel evaluation metric called Weighted Distance Ratio to ensure equivalence for different step-level transformations during evaluation. The authors propose a simple yet effective baseline method based on the transformer encoder, incorporating a novel sequence alignment loss to capture long-term dependencies between steps. This baseline outperforms other action recognition methods. The authors plan to release their codes and data.
