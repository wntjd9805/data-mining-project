The Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model represents human bodies using pose and shape parameters to create body meshes. However, not all parameter values result in realistic body meshes. In other words, the SMPL model is not fully constrained and can produce invalid results. To address this issue, we propose a prior that limits the SMPL parameters to values that generate realistic poses through adversarial training. Our learned prior accurately captures the diversity of real data, improves the optimization process for 3D reconstruction from 2D keypoints, and produces more accurate pose estimates when regressing from images. Our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art VAE-based method for constraining SMPL parameters in all these tasks. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/adv_param_pose_prior.
