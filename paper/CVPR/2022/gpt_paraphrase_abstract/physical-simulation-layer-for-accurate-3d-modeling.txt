We present a new approach to generative 3D modeling that focuses on ensuring the physical and functional consistency of the generated shapes. Unlike previous methods, our approach incorporates online physical simulation as part of the learning process. This is achieved by using a differentiable physical simulator within the training loop, allowing for end-to-end training. We introduce a fully differentiable point-based physical simulation layer that accurately evaluates the stability of the shapes under gravity. This layer is then integrated into a signed distance function (SDF) shape decoder. Through extensive experiments, we show that the inclusion of online physical simulation improves the accuracy, visual plausibility, and physical validity of the generated shapes without requiring additional data or manual annotation effort.
