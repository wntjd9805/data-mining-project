We propose a novel approach called Collaborative Glance-Gaze TransFormer (CoFormer) for grounded situation recognition, which involves predicting the main activity, identifying entities in certain roles, and determining their bounding-box groundings in an image. Our approach consists of two modules: Glance transformer for activity classification and Gaze transformer for entity estimation. The Glance transformer predicts the main activity by analyzing entities and their relations with the help of the Gaze transformer, which focuses on relevant entities. Our CoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SWiG dataset, outperforming other methods in all evaluation metrics. The training code and model weights are available at https://github.com/jhcho99/CoFormer.
