Color constancy is a crucial feature in digital photography and computer vision applications. Existing methods, both traditional and recent, have limitations as they rely on strict assumptions about target scenes. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes the degree of linear polarization to solve the color constancy problem effectively. By employing a physics-based polarization model, the proposed method reduces the number of assumptions compared to previous techniques. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost and can handle scenes with multiple illuminations. The study provides publicly available evaluation scenes and codes to encourage further development in this area.
