This abstract discusses the need for faster imaging methods in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and the use of deep neural networks to reconstruct undersampled k-space data. While most existing methods focus on designing reconstruction networks or training strategies, there is limited research on learning and optimizing k-space sampling strategies using deep neural networks. The proposed approach introduces a novel optimization framework that treats k-space sampling as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) problem, which can be solved using neural ODE. The framework considers the sampling of k-space data as a dynamic system and incorporates additional constraints based on MRI physics. The study also demonstrates the collaborative learning of trajectory optimization and image reconstruction for improved imaging efficiency and performance. Experimental results on in-vivo datasets, including brain and knee images acquired with different sequences, show that the proposed method produces higher image quality in accelerated MRI compared to conventional undersampling schemes in both Cartesian and Non-Cartesian acquisitions.
