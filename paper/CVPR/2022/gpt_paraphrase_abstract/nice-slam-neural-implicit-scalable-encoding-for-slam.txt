Neural implicit representations have shown promising results in various domains, including simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, current methods suffer from over-smoothed scene reconstructions and struggle to handle large scenes. These limitations stem from their simple fully-connected network architecture that fails to incorporate local information from observations. To address this, we propose NICE-SLAM, a dense SLAM system that introduces a hierarchical scene representation to incorporate multi-level local information. By optimizing this representation with pre-trained geometric priors, we achieve detailed reconstruction of large indoor scenes. Compared to existing neural implicit SLAM systems, our approach is more scalable, efficient, and robust. Experimental results on five challenging datasets demonstrate the competitive mapping and tracking quality of NICE-SLAM.
