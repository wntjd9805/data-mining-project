To accurately predict stochastic pedestrian trajectories, it is crucial to capture their multimodal nature and consider both observation paths and latent decision vectors. However, existing stochastic approaches yield inconsistent results due to random sampling of the latent vector. In this study, we address this issue by comparing probabilistic distributions derived from prediction samples and socially-acceptable paths. Our analysis reveals that all stochastic models suffer from bias towards random sampling, resulting in unrealistic path sets. Unfortunately, obtaining an infinite number of samples is impractical. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method, which ensures uniform coverage in the sampling space as an alternative to random sampling. By employing the same finite number of samples, the QMC approach significantly improves multimodal prediction outcomes. Furthermore, we introduce the Non-Probability Sampling Network (NPSN), a small network with approximately 5K parameters, that incorporates a learnable sampling network into existing trajectory prediction models. NPSN employs pedestrian's past paths and social interactions to generate purposeful sample sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NPSN enhances prediction accuracy (by up to 60%) and reliability on a public pedestrian trajectory prediction benchmark.
