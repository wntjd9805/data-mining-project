This paper examines the shortcomings of applying the common practice of downsampling feature maps in LiDAR-based 3D object detection for autonomous driving. The authors propose a solution called Single-stride Sparse Transformer (SST) to maintain the original resolution throughout the network, addressing the problem of insufficient receptive field in single-stride architectures. The SST method cooperates well with the sparsity of point clouds and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Waymo Open Dataset. It also demonstrates promising performance in detecting small objects such as pedestrians. The authors plan to make their code publicly available in the near future.
