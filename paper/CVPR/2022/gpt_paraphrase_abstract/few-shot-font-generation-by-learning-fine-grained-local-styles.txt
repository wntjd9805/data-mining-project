Few-shot font generation (FFG) is a technique that aims to generate new fonts with only a few examples, thereby reducing labor costs. Traditionally, FFG pipelines consider characters in a standard font library as content glyphs and transfer their style information to a new target font using reference glyphs. However, existing solutions tend to disentangle content and style globally or component-wise. This approach overlooks the fact that the style of glyphs is primarily embedded in the local details, such as radicals, components, and strokes. Consequently, a single character can exhibit different styles distributed across spatial locations. In this paper, we propose a novel font generation approach that learns fine-grained local styles from references and establishes spatial correspondence between content and reference glyphs. By utilizing cross-attention, we assign the appropriate fine-grained style to each spatial location in the content glyph. Unlike previous methods that disentangle global or component-wise modeling, our cross-attention mechanism can identify the relevant local styles in the reference glyphs and aggregate them into a fine-grained style representation for the given content glyphs. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in FFG. Furthermore, user studies confirm that our approach significantly improves style consistency compared to previous methods.
