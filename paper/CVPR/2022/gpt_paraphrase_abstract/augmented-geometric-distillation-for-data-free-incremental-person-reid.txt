We address the challenge of incremental learning in Person Re-identification (ReID), where a system needs to retain previous knowledge while learning new information. Existing class incremental learning methods are not suitable for ReID due to privacy concerns and the open-set retrieval setting. To solve these issues, we propose a framework called Augmented Geometric Distillation (AGD). Firstly, we develop a data-free incremental framework with a dreaming memory to protect privacy. We identify a problem called "noisy distillation" caused by noise in the dreaming memory and propose a solution to mitigate it by augmenting distillation in a pairwise and crosswise manner across different views of memory. Secondly, to handle the open-set retrieval property, we maintain the structure of the feature space during evolution using a novel geometric approach and preserve relationships between exemplars when representations change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AGD outperforms the baseline method with a margin of 6.0% mAP / 7.9% R@1 and can also be applied to class incremental learning. The code for our framework is available [insert link].
