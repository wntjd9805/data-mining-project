The abstract discusses the evaluation of generative models by measuring the differences between real and generated images. The commonly used Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric is based on extracting "high-level" features using a deep network. However, the abstract highlights the potential impact of "low-level" preprocessing, such as image resizing and compression, on the evaluation metrics. It points out that the differences in preprocessing techniques can lead to significant variations and unexpected consequences. For example, when resizing an image, the choice of prefilter width should be adjusted based on the downsampling factor to avoid aliasing artifacts, but commonly used implementations use a fixed-width prefilter. Additionally, lossy compression methods like JPEG can introduce variations in the downstream analysis. Surprisingly, the abstract reveals that if compression is applied to real training images, the FID metric can actually improve if the generated images are also compressed. The paper emphasizes the importance of considering low-level image processing in generative modeling and provides recommendations based on signal processing principles. It also offers a reference implementation to facilitate future comparisons.
