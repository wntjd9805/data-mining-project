We introduce DPICT, a novel deep progressive image compression algorithm that supports fine granular scalability (FGS). Our approach involves transforming an image into a latent tensor using an analysis network. This latent tensor is then encoded into a compressed bitstream trit-plane by trit-plane, with trits represented in ternary digits. The encoding process follows a decreasing order of significance, and within each trit-plane, trits are sorted based on their rate-distortion priorities. The more important information is transmitted first. To address the limitations of the compression network for fewer trit-planes, we have developed a postprocessing network for refining reconstructed images at low rates. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DPICT compared to traditional progressive codecs, all while enabling FGS transmission.
