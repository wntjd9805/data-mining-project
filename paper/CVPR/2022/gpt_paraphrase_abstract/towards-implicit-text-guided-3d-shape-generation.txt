This study explores the difficult task of generating 3D shapes from text. We propose a novel approach that can generate high-quality shapes with colors that match the provided text description. Our approach includes several technical contributions. Firstly, we separate the shape and color predictions to learn features from both texts and shapes. We introduce the word-level spatial transformer to correlate word features from the text with spatial features from the shape. Additionally, we incorporate a cyclic loss to ensure consistency between the text and shape, and utilize shape IMLE to diversify the generated shapes. Furthermore, we extend the framework to allow text-guided shape manipulation. Through extensive experiments on the largest existing text-shape benchmark, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach.
