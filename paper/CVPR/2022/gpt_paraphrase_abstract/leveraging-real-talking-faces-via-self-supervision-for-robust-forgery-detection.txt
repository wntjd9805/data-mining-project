This paper addresses the challenge of detecting manipulated face videos when faced with unseen forgery methods and common corruptions such as compression. The authors propose a method called RealForensics that utilizes videos of real talking faces, which are easily accessible online and contain valuable information about natural facial appearance and behavior. RealForensics consists of two stages. First, it learns temporally dense video representations by exploiting the natural correspondence between visual and auditory modalities in real videos in a self-supervised cross-modal manner. These representations capture factors such as facial movements, expression, and identity. In the second stage, these learned representations are used as targets for the forgery detector, along with the binary forgery classification task. This encourages the detector to make its real/fake decision based on these factors. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-manipulation generalization and robustness experiments. They also analyze the factors contributing to its performance. The results suggest that leveraging natural and unlabelled videos shows promise in developing more robust face forgery detectors.
