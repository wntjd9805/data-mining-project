Recently, there has been growing interest in crowd density estimation. The main challenge in this task is obtaining high-quality manual annotations for a large amount of training data. To address this challenge, previous studies have utilized unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques, which transfer knowledge from synthetic data to real-world datasets. However, existing methods either rely on external data or use a costly coarse-to-fine estimation process. In this study, we propose a new adversarial learning based method that is simple and efficient. To reduce the difference between synthetic and real data, we introduce a bi-level alignment framework called BLA. This framework includes task-driven data alignment and fine-grained feature alignment. Unlike previous domain augmentation methods, we use AutoML to search for an optimal transform on the source domain that is well-suited for the downstream task. Additionally, we perform fine-grained alignment separately for the foreground and background to alleviate alignment difficulties. We evaluate our approach on five real-world crowd counting benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our approach is straightforward to implement and efficient to apply. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Yankeegsj/BLA.
