Most object detection methods have traditionally used non-maximum suppression (NMS) to remove redundant bounding boxes. However, we challenge these NMS-based methods in three ways: 1) The bounding box with the highest confidence may not necessarily be the true positive with the greatest overlap with the ground-truth box. 2) It is not enough to simply suppress redundant boxes; we also need to enhance the confidence of true positives. 3) Sorting candidate boxes by confidence values is not necessary and can limit parallelism.In this paper, we propose a new method called ConÔ¨Ådence Propagation Cluster (CP-Cluster) inspired by belief propagation (BP) to replace NMS-based methods. CP-Cluster is fully parallelizable and achieves higher accuracy. It utilizes message passing to penalize redundant boxes and enhance true positives iteratively until convergence. We evaluated the effectiveness of CP-Cluster by applying it to popular detectors like FasterRCNN, SSD, FCOS, YOLOv3, YOLOv5, Centernet, etc. Experimental results on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our plug and play method significantly improves the average mAP (mean Average Precision) of these state-of-the-art models by a clear margin (0.3 to 1.9) compared to NMS-based methods. Furthermore, our method achieves these improvements without requiring retraining of the detectors.
