We introduce PHORHUM, a new deep neural network technique called PHORHUM, which allows for realistic 3D human reconstruction using only a single RGB image. Our approach accurately estimates the detailed 3D geometry of the human body and, for the first time, also captures the unshaded surface color and scene illumination. We acknowledge that relying solely on 3D supervision is insufficient for precise color reconstruction, so we propose patch-based rendering losses that improve color accuracy on visible parts of the human and provide plausible color estimation for non-visible areas. Furthermore, our method overcomes limitations of previous approaches by effectively disentangling geometry, albedo, and illumination factors within an end-to-end model. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in geometric and color reconstruction based on qualitative assessments and various metrics.
