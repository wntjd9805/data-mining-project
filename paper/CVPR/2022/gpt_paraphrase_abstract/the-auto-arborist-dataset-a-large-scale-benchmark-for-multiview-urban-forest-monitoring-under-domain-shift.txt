Generalizing computer vision models to new domains is a significant challenge. While these models perform well on benchmarks, they often fail when applied outside of the training distribution. To develop computer vision systems that can effectively address real-world problems on a global scale, it is crucial to have benchmarks that encompass the complexities of the real world, such as geographic domain shift, long-tailed distributions, and data noise.To address this need, we propose using urban forest monitoring as a testbed for studying and improving computer vision challenges. This approach not only helps advance computer vision techniques but also serves the important environmental and societal goal of monitoring urban forests. Urban forests offer numerous benefits to urban societies, but managing them is expensive. One costly aspect is monitoring existing trees, including their locations, species, and health. Currently, this monitoring is done through human-expert tree censuses, which are expensive and infrequently collected, costing cities millions of dollars per census.Existing research on automating urban forest monitoring has focused on small datasets from individual cities, limited to common tree categories. To overcome these limitations, we present a new large-scale dataset called Auto Arborist. This dataset combines public tree censuses from 23 cities with a vast collection of street-level and aerial imagery. Auto Arborist contains over 2.5 million trees and 344 genera, making it over two orders of magnitude larger than the closest dataset in the literature. We provide baseline results on our dataset across different data modalities and introduce metrics for analyzing generalization concerning geographic distribution shifts, which are vital for deploying such a system at scale.
