This paper explores a novel extrinsic method for aligning geometric shapes using point-to-point correspondences in ambient space. The method involves recovering a deformation, which enables the acquisition of more continuous and smooth maps. The traditional coherent point drift method is revisited and generalized to improve its performance. Firstly, the kernel method is extended to non-Euclidean domains, resulting in improved results for processing two-dimensional manifold shapes. Secondly, a generalized probabilistic model is proposed to address the sensitivity of the coherent point drift method to local optima. Instead of optimizing directly over the objective of coherent point drift, the new model allows focusing on a group of the most confident correspondences, thereby enhancing the robustness of the registration system. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple public datasets and compared to state-of-the-art competitors, demonstrating its superiority in terms of flexibility, efficiency, and improved matching accuracy. This is achieved through the extrinsic alignment objective in ambient space.
