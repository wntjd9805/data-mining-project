The field of image denoising has made significant progress by developing effective deep denoisers. Recent trends in improving denoising performance in real-world scenarios involve two approaches: creating better noise models for training data synthesis and estimating noise level functions to guide non-blind denoisers. This study combines both noise modeling and estimation to propose a novel pipeline for generating realistic noisy images. The model learns a fine-grained statistical noise estimation model in a contrastive manner and uses the estimated parameters to model camera-specific noise distribution, resulting in the synthesis of realistic noisy training data. An important aspect of this work is that by calibrating noise models of multiple sensors, the model can also predict noise models for other cameras. This means that camera-specific noise models can be estimated for unknown sensors using only testing images, without the need for laborious calibration frames or paired noisy/clean data. The proposed pipeline enhances the performance of deep denoisers, achieving competitive results compared to state-of-the-art real noise modeling methods.
