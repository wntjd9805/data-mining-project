We introduce De-formable ProtoPNet, an image classifier that combines deep learning and case-based reasoning to provide interpretable explanations. Unlike previous methods, our model uses spatially flexible prototypes composed of prototypical parts that adjust their positions according to each input image. This enables our model to capture pose variations and context, leading to improved accuracy and richer explanations. In comparison to other interpretable models, our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and provides explanations with greater context. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/jdonnelly36/Deformable-ProtoPNet.
