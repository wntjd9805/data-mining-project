To enhance the evaluation and enhancement of autonomous vehicle planning, it is necessary to create a large number of diverse traffic scenarios. These scenarios should be both realistic and challenging, while still being possible to navigate safely. This research introduces STRIVE, a method for automatically generating challenging scenarios that provoke undesirable behavior, such as collisions, from a given planner. To ensure the plausibility of the scenarios, a graph-based conditional VAE is utilized to learn a model of traffic motion. The generation of scenarios involves optimizing the latent space of this traffic model, perturbing real-world scenes to produce trajectories that result in collisions for the planner. An additional optimization is then employed to find a "solution" to the scenario, ensuring its usefulness for improving the given planner. The generated scenarios are further analyzed and grouped based on the type of collision. The effectiveness of STRIVE is demonstrated by applying it to two different planners, successfully generating realistic and challenging scenarios in both cases. Furthermore, these scenarios are utilized to optimize the hyperparameters of a rule-based planner, completing the loop of scenario generation and planner improvement.
