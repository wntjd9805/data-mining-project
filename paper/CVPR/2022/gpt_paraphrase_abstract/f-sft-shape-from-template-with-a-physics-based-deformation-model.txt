Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods are used to estimate 3D surface deformations from a single monocular RGB camera, assuming a known 3D state in advance. However, this is a challenging problem due to the limited information provided by the monocular setting. Previous SfT techniques have mainly relied on geometric and simplified deformation models, which can restrict their ability to accurately reconstruct surfaces. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel SfT approach that utilizes physical simulations to explain 2D observations, taking into account forces and material properties. A differentiable physics simulator is employed to regulate the surface evolution and optimize the elastic properties of the material, such as bending coefficients, stretching stiffness, and density. The estimated 3D states are then compared to the input images using a differentiable renderer, minimizing the dense reprojection error. The deformation parameters are recovered through adaptive gradient-based optimization. The proposed approach is evaluated using an RGB-D camera to capture real surfaces subjected to physical forces and various material properties and textures. Results demonstrate a significant reduction in 3D reconstruction error compared to other competing methods.
