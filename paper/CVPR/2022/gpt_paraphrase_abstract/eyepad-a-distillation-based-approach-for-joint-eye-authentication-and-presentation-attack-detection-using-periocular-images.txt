A practical eye authentication system is needed for edge devices that can authenticate users and defend against presentation attacks, while also being efficient in terms of computation and latency. However, current eye-based frameworks handle authentication and Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) separately and involve complex pre-processing steps to extract the iris region. In this study, we propose a combined framework for eye authentication and PAD using periocular images. Although a deep Multitask Learning (MTL) network can handle both tasks, it suffers from the forgetting effect due to disjoint training datasets for authentication and PAD. To address this issue, we introduce Eye Authentication with PAD (EyePAD), a distillation-based method that trains a single network for both tasks while minimizing the forgetting effect. Additionally, we present EyePAD++, an enhanced approach that trains an MTL network on both authentication and PAD data, and further incorporates an additional distillation step to capture the versatility of the EyePAD network. Our proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art in PAD and achieve near-state-of-the-art performance in eye-to-eye verification without requiring any pre-processing. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of EyePAD and EyePAD++ in user-to-user verification with PAD across different network backbones and image quality.
