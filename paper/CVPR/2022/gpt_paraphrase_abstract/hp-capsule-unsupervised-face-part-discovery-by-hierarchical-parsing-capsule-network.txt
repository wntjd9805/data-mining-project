This paper introduces the Hierarchical Parsing Capsule Network (HP-Capsule), which aims to discover unsupervised face subpart-part relationships. Unlike previous works that focused on simple objects like digits, HP-Capsule specifically targets human faces, which have homologous structures suitable for capsule-based description. The network encodes frequently observed patterns using explainable subpart capsules and then assembles them into part-level capsules using a Transformer-based Parsing Module (TPM) to learn the compositional relations. Throughout the training process, the part capsules progressively refine the face hierarchy and adaptively encode the face parts with semantic consistency. HP-Capsule not only extends the application of capsule networks to human faces but also demonstrates how neural networks can understand homologous objects without human intervention. Additionally, HP-Capsule provides unsupervised face segmentation results based on the covered regions of part capsules, enabling both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Experimental results on the BP4D and Multi-PIE datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
