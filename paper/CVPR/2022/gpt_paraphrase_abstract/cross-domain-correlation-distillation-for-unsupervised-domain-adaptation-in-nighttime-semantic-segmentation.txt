The performance of nighttime semantic segmentation is limited due to poor lighting conditions and a lack of detailed annotations. Previous approaches that use twilight as an intermediate domain for adaptation from daytime to nighttime may not effectively handle the inherent differences between datasets caused by camera equipment and urban style. To address both the illumination and dataset differences, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework called CCDistill. This framework utilizes cross-domain correlation distillation to explore the invariance of illumination and dataset differences, compensating for the lack of labels in nighttime images. By extracting content and style knowledge from features and calculating the degree of difference in illumination or dataset, CCDistill achieves domain adaptation. Extensive experiments on Dark Zurich and ACDC datasets demonstrate that CCDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance in nighttime semantic segmentation. Importantly, our method is a one-stage domain adaptation network that does not impact inference time. The implementation of CCDistill can be found at https://github.com/ghuan99/CCDistill.
