We investigate the issue of few-shot open-set recognition (FSOR), which involves developing a recognition system that can quickly adapt to new classes with limited labeled examples and reject unknown negative samples. Traditional large-scale open-set methods have proven ineffective for FSOR due to limited data. Current FSOR approaches typically adjust few-shot closed-set classifiers to be sensitive to negative samples so that they can be rejected using a predefined threshold. However, determining the appropriate threshold is a difficult task as different FSOR tasks may require different levels of rejection. In this study, we propose a task-adaptive negative class envision for FSOR, which incorporates threshold tuning into the learning process. Our approach involves enhancing the few-shot closed-set classifier with additional negative prototypes generated from few-shot examples. By considering few-shot class correlations in the negative generation process, we can establish dynamic rejection boundaries for FSOR tasks. Moreover, we expand our method to generalized few-shot open-set recognition (GF-SOR), which involves classifying both many-shot and few-shot classes while also rejecting negative samples. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our methods for both FSOR and GF-SOR tasks.
