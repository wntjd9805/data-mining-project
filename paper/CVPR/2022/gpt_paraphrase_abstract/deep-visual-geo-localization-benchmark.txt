This paper introduces a novel open-source benchmarking framework for Visual Geo-localization (VG) that enables the construction, training, and testing of various commonly used architectures while allowing for the modification of individual components in a geo-localization pipeline. The framework serves two main purposes: 1) gaining insights into how different components and design choices in a VG pipeline affect the final results in terms of performance and system requirements, and 2) establishing a systematic evaluation protocol for comparing different methods. By utilizing this framework, a comprehensive set of experiments is conducted to determine the optimal backbone, aggregation, and negative mining techniques based on specific use-cases and requirements. Additionally, the impact of engineering techniques such as pre/post-processing, data augmentation, and image resizing is assessed, revealing that significant performance improvements can be achieved through relatively simple procedures. For instance, reducing the resolution of images by 80% yields similar results while reducing extraction time and dataset storage by 36%. The code and trained models are readily available at the provided dataset storage requirement: https://deep-vg-bench.herokuapp.com/.
