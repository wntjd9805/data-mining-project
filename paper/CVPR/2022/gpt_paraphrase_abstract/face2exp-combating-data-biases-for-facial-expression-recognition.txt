Facial expression recognition (FER) is a difficult task due to imbalanced data collection. Previous approaches have addressed the issue by using labeled facial expression datasets. In contrast, we propose a novel method that leverages large unlabeled face recognition (FR) datasets to improve FER. However, this introduces a new challenge of distribution mismatch between FR and FER data. To address this, we introduce the Meta-Face2Exp framework, which includes a base network and an adaptation network. The base network learns expression knowledge from balanced FER data, while the adaptation network is trained to fit pseudo labels generated by the base model using FR data. To tackle the mismatch, Meta-Face2Exp incorporates a circuit feedback mechanism that enhances the base network using feedback from the adaptation network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art FER methods while utilizing only 10% of the labeled FER data used by baseline methods. Furthermore, we show that the circuit feedback mechanism effectively eliminates data bias.
