We propose a new approach for registering RGB-D scans with less overlap. Instead of relying on local feature points that often result in mismatches, our method utilizes global information to guide the registration process. We achieve this by constructing a panorama that captures the overall scene and aligning the scans with this panorama. To construct the panorama, we develop a scene inference network that captures global information. Furthermore, we employ a reinforcement learning strategy to iteratively align the scans with the panorama and refine the panorama representation. This strategy reduces noise and ensures consistency in both geometric and photometric alignments. Our method outperforms existing approaches on benchmark datasets such as SUNCG, Matterport, and ScanNet.
