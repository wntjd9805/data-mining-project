We propose a new model, called MIL-derived transformer, for weakly supervised point cloud segmentation. The model utilizes multiple instance learning (MIL) to explore pair-wise cloud-level supervision, where positive and negative bags are created based on the category of the clouds. Additionally, we integrate Adaptive global weighted pooling (AdaGWP) into the transformer model to improve robustness to noise and discover more complete foreground points. We also employ point subsampling and feature equivariance to regularize the model. Our method is end-to-end trainable and can work with different types of weak supervision signals. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. The source code can be found at https://github.com/jimmy15923/wspss_mil_transformer.
