We propose Programmatic Motion Concepts, a hierarchical motion representation for human actions that captures both low-level motion and high-level description as motion concepts. This representation facilitates the description, editing, and synthesis of new video sequences within a single framework. We introduce an architecture that learns this concept representation from paired video and action sequences using a semi-supervised approach. Additionally, our compact representation enables data-efficient learning through a low-resource training recipe. By surpassing established baselines, particularly in scenarios with limited data, we showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework for various applications.
