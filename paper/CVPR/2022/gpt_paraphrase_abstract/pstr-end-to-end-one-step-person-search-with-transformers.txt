We present a new approach called PSTR, which is a one-step transformer-based framework for person search. PSTR combines person detection and re-identification into a single architecture. It includes a specialized module called PSS, which consists of a detection encoder-decoder for person detection and a discriminative re-id decoder for person re-identification. The re-id decoder uses a multi-level supervision scheme and a part attention block to capture the relationship between different parts of a person. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale scheme to support re-identification across person instances at different scales. PSTR simultaneously achieves object-level recognition (detection) and instance-level matching (re-id). This is the first end-to-end one-step transformer-based person search framework proposed. We evaluate PSTR on the CUHK-SYSU and PRW benchmarks and conduct extensive ablations to demonstrate its effectiveness. PSTR achieves state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks, with a mean average precision (mAP) score of 56.5% on the challenging PRW benchmark.
