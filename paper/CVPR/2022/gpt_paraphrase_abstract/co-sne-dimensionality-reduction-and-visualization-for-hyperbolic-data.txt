Hyperbolic space has the ability to represent hierarchies found in real-world data and semantics. However, most hyperbolic models use low-dimensional embeddings due to the challenges of optimizing and visualizing high-dimensional hyperbolic data. In this study, we introduce CO-SNE, an extension of the visualization tool t-SNE, specifically designed for hyperbolic space. CO-SNE converts distances between data points into joint probabilities and aims to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint probabilities of high-dimensional data and low-dimensional embeddings. Unlike Euclidean space, hyperbolic space is not uniform, meaning that the density of points can vary depending on their location. To address this, CO-SNE uses hyperbolic normal distributions for the high-dimensional data and hyperbolic Cauchy distributions for the low-dimensional embeddings, while also preserving the individual distances of the data points to the origin. We evaluate CO-SNE using naturally hyperbolic data and supervisedly learned hyperbolic features, and our results show that CO-SNE successfully reduces high-dimensional hyperbolic data to a low-dimensional space without losing their hyperbolic characteristics. In fact, CO-SNE outperforms popular visualization tools like PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, and HoroPCA, which are also designed for hyperbolic data.
