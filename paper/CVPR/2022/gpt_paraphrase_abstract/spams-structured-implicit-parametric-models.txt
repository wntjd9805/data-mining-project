Parametric 3D models have been widely used to model deformable objects like human bodies, faces, and hands. However, creating these models requires a significant amount of manual effort and expertise. Recently, neural implicit 3D representations have emerged as a powerful method for capturing shape geometry. We have observed that deformable object motion often has a semantic structure. In light of this, we propose a new approach called Structured-implicit PArametric Models (SPAMs) that decomposes non-rigid object motion into part-based disentangled representations of shape and pose. These representations are learned using deep implicit functions. By decomposing the object into parts, we can establish coarse motion correspondence, allowing us to fit new depth sequences of unobserved shapes. This is achieved by establishing part correspondences between the input observation and our learned part spaces. Our approach enables robust joint optimization of the shape and pose of all parts, even in cases of dramatic motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that our part-aware shape and pose understanding leads to state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing and tracking depth sequences of complex deforming object motion.
