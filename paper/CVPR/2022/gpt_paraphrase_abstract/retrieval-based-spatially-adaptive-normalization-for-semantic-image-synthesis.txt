Semantic image synthesis is a difficult task with many practical uses. While progress has been made in this area, existing methods often produce blurry results due to the lack of fine-grained guidance. In this paper, we propose a new normalization module called RESAIL that introduces pixel-level guidance to the synthesis process. We achieve this by retrieving similar content patches from a training set and using them to guide the normalization of feature activations. We also incorporate distorted ground-truth images as an alternative source of guidance. Our experiments demonstrate that RESAIL outperforms existing methods in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and subjective evaluation.
