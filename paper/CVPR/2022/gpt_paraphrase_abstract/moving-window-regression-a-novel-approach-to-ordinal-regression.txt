This paper introduces a novel ordinal regression algorithm called moving window regression (MWR). The algorithm proposes a new order representation scheme called relative rank (ρ-rank) for input and reference instances. It also develops global and local relative regressors (ρ-regressors) to predict ρ-ranks for entire and specific rank ranges. Additionally, the algorithm iteratively refines an initial rank estimate by selecting two reference instances to form a search window and estimating the ρ-rank within that window. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets for facial age estimation and historical color image classification. The algorithm's source code is available at https://github.com/nhshin-mcl/MWR.
