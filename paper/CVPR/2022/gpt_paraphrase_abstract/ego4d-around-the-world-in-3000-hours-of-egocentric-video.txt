We have created Ego4D, a large-scale egocentric video dataset and benchmark suite. This dataset consists of 3,670 hours of daily-life activity videos, covering various scenarios like household, outdoor, workplace, leisure, etc. These videos were recorded by 931 individuals wearing cameras in 74 different locations across 9 countries. We have prioritized privacy and ethics by obtaining consent from participants and implementing robust de-identification processes. Ego4D significantly increases the availability of diverse egocentric video footage for the research community. Some of the videos are accompanied by audio, 3D environment models, eye gaze data, stereo, and synchronized videos from multiple cameras. Additionally, we have introduced new benchmark challenges focused on understanding the first-person visual experience in the past (retrieving memories), present (analyzing hand-object interactions, audio-visual conversations, and social interactions), and future (predicting activities). By publicly sharing this extensively annotated dataset and benchmark suite, our goal is to advance the field of first-person perception.
