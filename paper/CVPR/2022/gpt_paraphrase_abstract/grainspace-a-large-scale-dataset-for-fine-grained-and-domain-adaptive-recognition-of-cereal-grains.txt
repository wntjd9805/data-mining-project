Cereal grains are essential for human diets and global trade. Grain Appearance Inspection (GAI) is a crucial step in determining grain quality for proper storage and processing. Currently, GAI is done manually with the help of tools, but automation can greatly assist inspectors. However, the lack of datasets and clear task definitions has hindered progress in automated GAI. To address this, we present GrainSpace, a publicly available dataset for cereal grain inspection. We collected 5.25 million images of wheat, maize, and rice from different regions and countries. We also developed a benchmark using semi-supervised learning and self-supervised learning techniques. GrainSpace is the first dataset of its kind and is accessible at https://github.com/hellodfan/GrainSpace.
