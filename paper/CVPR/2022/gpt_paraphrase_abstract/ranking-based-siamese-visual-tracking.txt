Siamese-based trackers currently address visual tracking as two separate tasks: classification and localization. However, they overlook the relationship between positive and negative samples, and rely solely on the classification confidence of proposals for final prediction, leading to potential misalignment. To address these issues, this study introduces a ranking-based optimization algorithm that explores the relationship among different proposals. Two ranking losses are proposed: classification ranking loss and IoU-guided ranking loss. The classification ranking loss ensures that positive samples are ranked higher than hard negative samples, preventing trackers from being misled by distractors. The IoU-guided ranking loss aligns classification confidence scores with the Intersection over Union (IoU) of corresponding localization predictions for positive samples, enabling well-localized predictions to be represented with high classification confidence. These ranking losses are compatible with most Siamese trackers and do not require additional computation during inference. Extensive experiments on seven tracking benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ranking-based optimization algorithm.
