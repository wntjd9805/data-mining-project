Instance segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision that involves identifying and separating each object in an image. Traditionally, this task requires expensive annotations like bounding boxes and segmentation masks for training. However, in this study, we propose a fully unsupervised learning approach to achieve class-agnostic instance segmentation without any annotations.Our method, called FreeSOLO, is built upon the simple instance segmentation method SOLO and introduces a novel localization-aware pre-training framework. This framework allows objects to be discovered from complex scenes in an unsupervised manner. FreeSOLO achieves impressive results on the challenging COCO dataset, surpassing several segmentation proposal methods that rely on manual annotations. This demonstrates the successful implementation of unsupervised class-agnostic instance segmentation.Furthermore, FreeSOLO's box localization significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised object detection/discovery methods, demonstrating a relative improvement of about 100% in COCO AP. As a pre-training method, FreeSOLO also exhibits superiority by outperforming other self-supervised pre-training methods by 9.8% AP when fine-tuning instance segmentation using only 5% of COCO masks.It is worth mentioning that part of this research was conducted when XW was an intern at NVIDIA, and CS was affiliated with The University of Adelaide.
