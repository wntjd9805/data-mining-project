This study introduces TCTrack1, a comprehensive framework designed to maximize the utilization of temporal contexts in aerial tracking. Existing visual trackers often fail to fully exploit the temporal information present in consecutive frames. TCTrack1 addresses this limitation by incorporating temporal contexts at two levels: feature extraction and similarity map refinement.To enhance feature extraction, the framework proposes an online temporally adaptive convolution. This method leverages temporal information by dynamically adjusting convolution weights based on previous frames. By doing so, spatial features are enhanced, resulting in more accurate tracking.For similarity map refinement, TCTrack1 introduces an adaptive temporal transformer. This component efficiently encodes temporal knowledge and subsequently decodes it to accurately adjust the similarity map. By effectively utilizing temporal information, the framework achieves precise tracking.TCTrack1 proves to be both effective and efficient. Evaluation on four aerial tracking benchmarks demonstrates its impressive performance. Additionally, real-world UAV tests reveal its high speed, achieving over 27 frames per second on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform.
