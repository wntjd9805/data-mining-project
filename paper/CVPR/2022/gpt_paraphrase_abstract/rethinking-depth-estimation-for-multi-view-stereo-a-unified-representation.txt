Existing learning-based multi-view stereo methods solve depth estimation either as a regression or classification problem. While both approaches have shown excellent performance, they have their limitations. Regression methods tend to overfit due to indirect learning cost volume, and classification methods cannot directly predict the exact depth due to discrete predictions. To address these issues, we propose a novel representation called Unification, which combines the strengths of regression and classification. This representation can constrain the cost volume like classification methods while also achieving sub-pixel depth prediction like regression methods. To further enhance the potential of Unification, we introduce a new loss function called Unified Focal Loss, which effectively tackles the challenge of sample imbalance. By integrating these two modules, we present a coarse-to-fine framework called UniMVSNet. Our model achieves first place rankings on both DTU and Tanks and Temples benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance and generalization ability.
