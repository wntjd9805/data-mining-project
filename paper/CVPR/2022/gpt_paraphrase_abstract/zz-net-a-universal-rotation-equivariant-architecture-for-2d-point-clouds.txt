This paper focuses on achieving rotation equivariance on 2D point cloud data. The authors introduce a specific set of functions that can effectively approximate any continuous rotation equivariant and permutation invariant function. Building upon this finding, they propose a novel neural network architecture designed for processing 2D point clouds. The authors demonstrate the universality of this architecture in approximating functions that exhibit these symmetries. Additionally, they explain how to extend the architecture to handle a collection of 2D-2D correspondences as input, while preserving similar equivariance properties. The paper includes experimental results showcasing the estimation of essential matrices in stereo vision.
