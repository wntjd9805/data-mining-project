This paper introduces a system that trains driving policies using experiences from multiple vehicles, not just the ego-vehicle. By leveraging the behaviors of other agents, the system generates diverse driving scenarios without requiring additional data. The main challenge in learning from other vehicles is the lack of sensor information. To overcome this, the system utilizes supervisory tasks to learn an intermediate representation that is independent of the controlling vehicle's viewpoint. This not only enhances the training signal but also enables more advanced reasoning during inference. By learning from all vehicles' driving behaviors, the system can predict their actions during testing and prevent collisions. The system's performance is evaluated through closed-loop driving simulations, where it outperforms previous methods on the CARLA Leaderboard significantly. It achieves a 25-point improvement in driving score and a 24-point increase in route completion rate.
