This study focuses on cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CD-WSOD), which aims to adapt a detection model to a new target domain using easily acquired image-level annotations. The key challenge lies in aligning the source and target domains to improve CD-WSOD accuracy. While existing methods concentrate on aligning certain detection components, this paper introduces a Holistic and Hierarchical Feature Alignment (H2FA) R-CNN that considers the importance of all detection components.  H2FA R-CNN introduces two image-level alignments for the backbone features and two instance-level alignments for the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and detection head. This hierarchical alignment approach follows the detection pipeline, processing the image-level feature and instance-level features from bottom to top. Additionally, a novel hybrid supervision method is devised to enable weak/full supervision for learning the two instance-level alignments. This allows the RPN and detection head to simultaneously receive supervision from both the target and source domains.  By combining all these feature alignments, H2FA R-CNN effectively reduces the gap between the source and target domains. Experimental results demonstrate that H2FA R-CNN significantly improves cross-domain object detection accuracy, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks.
