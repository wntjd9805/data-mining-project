We present Clustering Mask Transformer (CMT-DeepLab), a transformer-based framework for panoptic segmentation that incorporates clustering. Unlike existing transformer architectures used in segmentation and detection, CMT-DeepLab treats object queries as cluster centers, which group pixels for segmentation purposes. The clustering process involves assigning pixels to clusters based on feature affinity and updating cluster centers and pixel features. This process, known as the Clustering Mask Transformer (CMT) layer, produces denser and more consistent cross-attention for the final segmentation task. CMT-DeepLab outperforms previous approaches with a notable improvement of 4.4% PQ, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance of 55.7% PQ on the COCO test-dev set.
