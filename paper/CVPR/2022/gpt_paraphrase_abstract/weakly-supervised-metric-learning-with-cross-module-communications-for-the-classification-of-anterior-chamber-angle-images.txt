The evaluation of the Anterior Chamber Angle (ACA) for glaucoma treatment strategies typically relies on the judgement of experts. However, there is a lack of experienced ophthalmologists available for this task. Therefore, computer-aided ACA evaluations have become a necessary and effective solution. In this study, we propose a new automated Glaucoma Classification framework called GCNet, which is based on ACA images or other Glaucoma-related medical images. We created a dataset of ACA images and provided pixel-level annotations. We then developed a segmentation module and an embedding module to improve the classification performance of ACA images. Within GCNet, we designed a Cross-Module Aggregation Net (CMANet) to capture contextual information between these modules using weakly-supervised metric learning. We conducted experiments on the ACA dataset as well as two public datasets (REFUGE and SIGF). Our results demonstrate that GCNet outperforms several state-of-the-art deep models in glaucoma medical image classification tasks.
