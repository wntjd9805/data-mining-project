We present a new deep homography estimation architecture called Iterative Homography Network (IHN). Unlike previous approaches that use network cascading or untrainable IC-LK iterator for iterative refinement, IHN's iterator has tied weights and is fully trainable. IHN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging scenes across multiple datasets. We propose two versions of IHN: IHN for static scenes and IHN-mov for dynamic scenes with moving objects. Both versions can be configured in 1-scale for efficiency or 2-scale for improved accuracy.We demonstrate that the basic 1-scale IHN outperforms most existing methods. Moreover, the 2-scale IHN surpasses all competitors by a significant margin on various datasets. To enhance the estimation accuracy of scenes with moving objects, we introduce IHN-mov by generating an inlier mask. Through experiments, we show that the iterative framework of IHN achieves a 95% reduction in error while minimizing network parameters. When processing sequential image pairs, IHN achieves a speed of 32.7 frames per second, which is approximately 8 times faster than the IC-LK iterator.
