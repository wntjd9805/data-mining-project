Multi-object tracking in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos is a crucial task with a wide range of applications. However, traditional multi-object trackers struggle to perform well on UAV videos due to challenging factors such as irregular motion caused by moving cameras and changes in viewing angles. This paper presents a UAVMOT network specifically designed for multi-object tracking in UAV views. The UAVMOT incorporates an ID feature update module to improve object feature association. To effectively handle complex motions in UAV views, an adaptive motion filter module is developed. Additionally, a gradient balanced focal loss is employed to address the issues of imbalanced categories and detection of small objects. Experimental results on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that the proposed UAVMOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tracking methods on UAV videos.
