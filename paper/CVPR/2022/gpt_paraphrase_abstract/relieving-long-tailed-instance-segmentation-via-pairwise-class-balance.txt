Addressing the challenge of long-tailed instance segmentation, where there is an extreme imbalance of training samples among classes, is crucial. The bias between head classes (with majority samples) and tailed classes needs to be appropriately defined and alleviated. Previous approaches have used label distribution or mean score information to indicate a coarse-grained bias. In this study, we propose a new method called Pairwise Class Balance (PCB) that explores the confusion matrix to relieve pairwise biases and generalize the coarse bias. The confusion matrix is continuously updated during training to accumulate ongoing prediction preferences. PCB generates fightback soft labels for regularization during training and incorporates an iterative learning paradigm for progressive and smooth regularization. PCB can be easily integrated with existing methods as a complementary technique. Our experimental results on LVIS dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without any additional complexity. The superior performance across various architectures shows its generalization ability. The code and trained models can be accessed at https://github.com/megvii-research/PCB.
