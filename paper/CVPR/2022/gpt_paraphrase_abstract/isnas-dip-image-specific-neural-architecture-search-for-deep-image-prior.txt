Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have a bias towards lower frequencies, making them suitable for image restoration tasks in the Deep Image Prior (DIP) framework. However, determining the best-performing model in this framework is challenging and time-consuming. Existing neural architecture search (NAS) techniques are resource-intensive and determine models for the entire dataset rather than each image independently. In this study, we propose an image-specific NAS strategy for the DIP framework that requires less training and enables image-specific NAS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy by conducting experiments on image denoising, inpainting, and super-resolution tasks. Our results show that image-specific metrics can significantly reduce the search space and outperform current NAS approaches for image restoration.
