This paper proposes a deep learning solution to address the problem of unpleasant irregular boundaries in stitched images. Existing methods use a two-stage process involving mesh deformation to generate rectangular images, but they are limited to images with linear structures and result in distortions for non-linear objects. The proposed solution utilizes a fully convolutional network to predict an initial mesh, which is then used to form the mesh deformation. A comprehensive objective function is introduced to ensure high content fidelity, including encouraging boundary rectangularity, preserving mesh shape, and maintaining natural content perception. Additionally, a diverse dataset with irregular boundaries and scenes is created for image stitching rectangling. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional approaches in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
