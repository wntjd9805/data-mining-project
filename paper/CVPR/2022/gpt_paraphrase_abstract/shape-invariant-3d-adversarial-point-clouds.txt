Adversarial attacks on 3D point cloud recognition have been criticized for their noticeable point outliers and lack of proper constraints. In this paper, we propose a Point-Cloud Sensitivity Map to improve the efficiency and imperceptibility of point perturbations. This map identifies the vulnerability of point cloud recognition models to shape-invariant adversarial noises. Instead of using an implicit constraint like global distance loss, we design explicit constraints on the shape surface. Our approach involves a reversible coordinate transformation to limit point movement and calculates the best attacking direction using gradients obtained from a white-box model. We construct a sensitivity map by assigning each point a non-negative score, which enhances both adversarial invisibility and query efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches in terms of adversarial imperceptibility and resistance to different point cloud defense settings.
