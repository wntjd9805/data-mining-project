The removal of adverse weather conditions, such as rain, fog, and snow, from images is a critical issue in various applications. Existing methods in the literature have primarily focused on tackling one type of degradation at a time. Recently, a CNN-based approach called All-in-One was proposed to address all weather conditions simultaneously. However, this method has a high number of parameters due to the use of multiple encoders for each weather removal task and still has room for improvement in terms of performance. In this study, we concentrate on developing an efficient solution for the removal of all adverse weather conditions. To achieve this, we introduce TransWeather, an end-to-end model based on the transformer architecture. Unlike All-in-One, TransWeather utilizes only a single encoder and decoder to restore images degraded by any type of weather condition. Specifically, we employ a novel transformer encoder that employs intra-patch transformer blocks to enhance attention within patches, effectively removing minor weather degradations. Additionally, we introduce a transformer decoder with learnable weather type embeddings to adapt to the specific weather degradation present. TransWeather demonstrates significant improvements across multiple test datasets compared to both the All-in-One network and methods fine-tuned for specific tasks. Furthermore, TransWeather has been validated on real-world test images and proven to be more effective than previous techniques. The implementation code for TransWeather can be found in the supplementary document, and it is available at https://github.com/jeya-maria-jose/TransWeather.
