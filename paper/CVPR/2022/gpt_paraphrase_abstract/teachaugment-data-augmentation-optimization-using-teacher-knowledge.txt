There has been extensive research on optimizing image transformation functions for data augmentation. Adversarial data augmentation strategies, which aim to maximize task loss through augmentation, have shown significant improvements in model generalization for various tasks. However, current methods require careful parameter tuning to avoid excessive deformations that may remove important image features necessary for generalization.In this paper, we propose a new data augmentation optimization method called TeachAugment. This method leverages a teacher model to generate informative transformed images for the target model, without the need for meticulous tuning. The augmentation is designed to make the augmented images adversarial for the target model while still recognizable for the teacher model. Additionally, we introduce data augmentation using neural networks, which simplifies the design of the search space and allows for the update of data augmentation using the gradient method. Experimental results in image classification, semantic segmentation, and unsupervised representation learning tasks demonstrate that TeachAugment outperforms existing methods.
