Previous super-resolution (SR) methods have typically approached SR as a regression problem, resulting in blurry and unrealistic SR outputs. Recent advancements have incorporated adversarial loss and pixel-wise loss to train GAN-based models or introduced normalizing flows to generate more realistic SR images. However, autoregressive (AR) models, despite being a powerful generative approach, have not been explored in low-level tasks due to their limitations. This paper proposes a novel autoregressive model-based SR approach called LAR-SR, which effectively generates realistic SR images using a new local autoregressive (LAR) module. The LAR module can parallelly sample all patches of textural components, significantly reducing time consumption. Moreover, it can leverage contextual pixel information and be optimized using a consistent loss. Experimental results on widely-used datasets demonstrate that LAR-SR outperforms other generative models such as GAN and Flow in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics. It also remains competitive with the mixture generative model.
