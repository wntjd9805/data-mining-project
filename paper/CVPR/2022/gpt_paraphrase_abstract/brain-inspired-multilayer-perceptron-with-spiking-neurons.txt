Recently, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) has gained attention in computer vision tasks. MLPs perform well in feature extraction and achieve impressive results. However, their simplicity leads to a high dependence on local feature communication mechanisms. To enhance MLP performance, we incorporate information communication mechanisms inspired by brain-inspired neural networks. The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a well-known brain-inspired neural network that excels in handling sparse data. We integrate the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons from SNNs into MLP models to improve accuracy without additional computational costs. We introduce a full-precision LIF operation to facilitate communication between patches, including horizontal and vertical LIF in different directions. Additionally, we propose using group LIF to extract superior local features. With the inclusion of LIF modules, our SNN-MLP model achieves top-1 accuracies of 81.9%, 83.3%, and 83.5% on the ImageNet dataset with FLOPs of 4.4G, 8.5G, and 15.2G, respectively. These results represent the current state-of-the-art. The source code will be accessible at https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/research/cv/snn-mlp.
