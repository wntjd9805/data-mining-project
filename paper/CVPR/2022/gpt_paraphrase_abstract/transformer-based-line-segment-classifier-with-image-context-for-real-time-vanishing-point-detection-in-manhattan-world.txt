Previous research on detecting vanishing points has typically relied on geometric principles to cluster line segments. However, we have discovered that considering image context can also enhance the accuracy of line classification. Building upon this insight, we present a new approach for classifying line segments into three groups based on three sought-after vanishing points, assuming a Manhattan world. Our method, called Transformer based Line segment Classifier (TLC), utilizes both geometric information and image context to group line segments and estimate the corresponding vanishing points. TLC incorporates a line segment descriptor that represents each segment using its position, direction, and local image context. Additionally, a Transformer based feature fusion module is employed to capture global features from all line segments, resulting in significantly improved classification performance. By employing a network to score line segments and reject outliers, vanishing points can be obtained through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) from the classified lines. Our proposed method achieves a high processing speed of 25 frames per second on an NVIDIA 2080Ti card for vanishing point detection. Experimental evaluations conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalization capabilities when trained and evaluated on different datasets.
