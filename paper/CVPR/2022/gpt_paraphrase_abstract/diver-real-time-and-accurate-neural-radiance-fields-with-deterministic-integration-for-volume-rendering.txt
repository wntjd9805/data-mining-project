DIVeR is a novel approach that builds upon the concepts of NeRF and its variations to create realistic 3D object models from a limited number of images. Unlike previous NeRF methods, DIVeR employs deterministic estimates instead of stochastic ones for the volume rendering integral. Its representation is based on voxels, with each voxel containing a field of features. To compute the volume rendering integral, DIVeR divides a ray into intervals corresponding to each voxel and estimates the integral components using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based on the features of each interval, which are then aggregated. This allows DIVeR to accurately render thin translucent structures that other methods may miss. Additionally, DIVeR offers a relatively exposed semantic representation compared to alternative approaches, enabling natural edits by manipulating feature vectors within the voxel space. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that DIVeR produces models that achieve or surpass state-of-the-art quality, while being compact in size and rendering quickly without the need for baking. Furthermore, DIVeR allows for intuitive and natural model editing. The real-time implementation of DIVeR is publicly available at: https://github.com/lwwu2/diver-rt.
