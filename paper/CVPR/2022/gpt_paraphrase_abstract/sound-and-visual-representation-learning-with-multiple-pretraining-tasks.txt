This research focuses on the combination of multiple self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks to improve performance in downstream tasks. Different SSL tasks extract different features from the data, and these feature representations can vary in their effectiveness for different tasks. The study specifically examines binaural sounds and image data.For binaural sounds, three SSL tasks are proposed: spatial alignment, temporal synchronization of foreground objects and binaural sounds, and temporal gap prediction. Various approaches to combining multiple SSL tasks are investigated, and their impact on downstream tasks such as video retrieval, spatial sound super resolution, and semantic prediction is analyzed using the OmniAudio dataset. The experiments demonstrate that incremental learning of SSL tasks through Multi-SSL outperforms both single SSL task models and fully supervised models in terms of downstream task performance for binaural sound representations.To test the applicability of Multi-SSL models to other modalities, the study also considers image representation learning. Two recently proposed SSL tasks, MoCov2 and DenseCL, are used in this context. The results show that Multi-SSL surpasses existing methods like MoCov2, DenseCL, and DetCo in terms of VOC07 classification and COCO detection performance.Overall, this research highlights the benefits of combining multiple SSL tasks for improved performance in downstream tasks, both in the context of binaural sounds and image data.
