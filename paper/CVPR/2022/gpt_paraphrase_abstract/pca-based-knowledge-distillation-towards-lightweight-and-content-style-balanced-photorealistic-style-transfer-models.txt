We propose a novel approach to photorealistic style transfer by using PCA-based knowledge distillation. We observed that existing models are slow due to their large sizes, so we aim to distill lightweight models that can achieve similar results. Our method is the first knowledge distillation technique for photorealistic style transfer. We conducted experiments using different backbone architectures, VGG and MobileNet, at various image resolutions. Our top-performing model is 5-20 times faster and uses only 1% of the parameters compared to existing models. Moreover, our distilled models strike a better balance between stylization strength and content preservation. To facilitate reproducibility, we have made our code available at https://github.com/chiutaiyin/PCA-Knowledge-Distillation.
