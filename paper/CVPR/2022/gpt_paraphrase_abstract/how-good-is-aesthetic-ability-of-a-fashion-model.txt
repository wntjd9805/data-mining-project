We present A100 (Aesthetic 100), a novel approach for evaluating the aesthetic ability of fashion compatibility models. Unlike previous methods, A100 incorporates detailed characterization based on professional fashion knowledge, making it the first work to address the AI model's aesthetic ability in this domain. A100 possesses several desirable qualities: 1. Completeness, as it encompasses all types of standards in the fashion aesthetic system through two tests, LAT (Liberalism Aesthetic Test) and AAT (Academicism Aesthetic Test). 2. Reliability, as it is independent of training data and aligns with major indicators, providing a fair and unbiased assessment for model comparison. 3. Explainability, surpassing previous indicators, A100 identifies crucial characteristics of fashion aesthetics, allowing for a more nuanced evaluation of the model's performance in areas such as color, balance, material, and more. Experimental results demonstrate the advancements achieved by A100 in these aspects. All data can be accessed at https://github.com/AemikaChow/AiDLab-fAshIon-Data.
