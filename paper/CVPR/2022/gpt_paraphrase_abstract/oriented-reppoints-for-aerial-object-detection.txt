This paper introduces a novel approach to aerial object detection that addresses the challenges posed by non-axis aligned and arbitrarily oriented aerial targets with cluttered surroundings. Instead of regressing bounding box orientations, the proposed method utilizes adaptive points representation to capture the geometric information of these instances. Three oriented conversion functions are presented to facilitate accurate orientation-based classification and localization. Additionally, an effective quality assessment and sample assignment scheme is proposed for adaptive points learning, which selects representative oriented reppoints samples during training to capture non-axis aligned features and background noises. A spatial constraint is also introduced to penalize outlier points for robust adaptive learning. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experimental results on four challenging aerial datasets, including DOTA, HRSC2016, UCAS-AOD, and DIOR-R.
