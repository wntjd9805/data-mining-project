Trojan attacks pose a threat to deep neural networks (DNNs) by manipulating their behavior on specific inputs while appearing normal on most samples. Previous research has focused on detecting these attacks by identifying triggers injected during training. In a separate line of study, the lottery ticket hypothesis suggests the existence of sparse sub-networks that can achieve competitive performance after independent training. Building on these findings, we investigate the detection of Trojan DNNs through the lens of sparsity, even in the absence of clean training data. Our key observation is that Trojan features are more resistant to network pruning compared to benign features. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel Trojan network detection approach: first, identifying a "winning Trojan lottery ticket" that retains almost complete Trojan information but performs poorly on clean inputs; then, recovering the trigger embedded within this isolated sub-network. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets and network architectures, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-20s, and DenseNet-100, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
