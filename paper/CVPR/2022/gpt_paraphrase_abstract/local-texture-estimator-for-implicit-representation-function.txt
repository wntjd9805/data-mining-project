In this study, we examine the representation of images at various resolutions using implicit neural functions. While traditional multi-layer perceptron models have limitations in capturing high-frequency components, we propose a new approach called Local Texture Estimator (LTE). LTE is capable of estimating dominant frequencies in natural images, allowing the implicit function to preserve fine details during image reconstruction. When combined with a deep super-resolution architecture, LTE effectively characterizes image textures in 2D Fourier space. Our experiments demonstrate that the LTE-based neural function outperforms existing deep super-resolution methods across different scale factors. Additionally, we show that our implementation has the shortest running time compared to previous approaches.
