To address the challenge of constructing large-scale 3D point cloud datasets, we propose a new point cloud fractal database (PC-FractalDB). This database is based on a family of formula-driven supervised learning techniques inspired by fractal geometry found in natural 3D structures. Our research hypothesis is that by learning fractal geometry, we can obtain representations from a wider range of real-world 3D patterns compared to traditional 3D datasets. In this study, we demonstrate how PC-FractalDB helps solve various dataset-related issues in 3D scene understanding, including 3D model collection and labor-intensive annotation. Our experiments showcase impressive results, with performance rates of up to 61.9% and 59.0% achieved on the Scan-NetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively. These scores outperform the current highest scores attained by PointContrast, contrastive scene contexts (CSC), and RandomRooms. Notably, the PC-FractalDB pre-trained model proves particularly effective in training with limited data. For instance, with only 10% of training data on ScanNetV2, the PC-FractalDB pre-trained VoteNet achieves an accuracy of 38.3%, which is 14.8% higher than CSC. Remarkably, our proposed method also yields the best results for 3D object detection pre-training when dealing with limited point cloud data.
