This study examines the use of face models in image processing and other domains. The input data for creating a 3D face model can range from accurate laser scans to simple 2D RGB photographs. However, these input data types often have deficiencies, such as missing regions or being under-constrained. Therefore, reconstruction methods incorporate prior knowledge to define the valid domain of faces. When designing a system for a specific application that requires a certain level of accuracy, it is important to determine which types of input data are suitable. This paper aims to address this question by utilizing synthetic data.  The researchers utilize a ground truth dataset to assess the accuracy achievable from various types of input data, including 2D landmarks, 3D landmarks, low quality 3D data, high quality 3D data, texture color, normals, dense 2D image data, and cases where regions of the face are missing. Since the data used in this analysis is synthetic, it allows for evaluation with and without measurement errors. The findings from this idealized synthetic analysis are then compared to real results obtained from different methods of constructing 3D faces from 2D photographs.  The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of 3D face reconstruction is significantly limited when only 2D raw input data is available.
