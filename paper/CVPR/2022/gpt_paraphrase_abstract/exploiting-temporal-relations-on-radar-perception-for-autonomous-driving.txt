This study focuses on the problem of object recognition in autonomous driving using radar sensors. Radar is preferred over Lidar sensors due to its cost-effectiveness and ability to perform well in all weather conditions. However, radar signals have limitations in terms of angular resolution and precision in identifying surrounding objects. To address this, the researchers propose utilizing the temporal information from consecutive radar image frames to improve radar object recognition. They exploit the consistency of object attributes and existence, such as size and orientation, and introduce a temporal relational layer to explicitly model the relationships between objects in successive radar images. Through object detection and multiple object tracking experiments, the researchers demonstrate the superior performance of their method compared to various baseline approaches.
