We present a new method called E2EC for high-quality instance segmentation using contours. Existing methods rely on manual contour initialization and fixed backend prediction, limiting their performance. E2EC introduces a learnable contour initialization module and a global contour deformation module to improve performance. We also propose a label sampling scheme called multi-direction alignment to reduce learning difficulty. Additionally, we dynamically match predicted and ground truth vertex pairs to enhance boundary details and introduce a dynamic matching loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that E2EC achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets and is efficient for real-time applications. The code is available at the provided GitHub repository.
