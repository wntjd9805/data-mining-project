Enhancing the visibility of low-light images is a challenging task that is crucial for improving image quality in poor lighting conditions. In this study, we address the issue of photon loss caused by the Bayer-Filter on color camera sensors by developing a deep neural network-based De-Bayer-Filter simulator. This simulator generates a monochrome raw image from the colored raw image. We then propose a fully convolutional network that combines the colored raw data with the synthesized monochrome data to enhance low-light images. To ensure a complementary interaction between features from the colored and monochrome raw images, we introduce channel-wise attention during the fusion process. To train our convolutional networks, we create a dataset called Mono-Colored Raw paired dataset (MCR), which consists of monochrome and color raw image pairs captured using a monochrome camera without a Bayer-Filter and a color camera with a Bayer-Filter. Our approach leverages the fusion of virtual monochrome and color raw images, and our extensive experiments demonstrate that significant improvement in low-light image enhancement can be achieved through the use of raw sensor data and data-driven learning.
