Semantic segmentation of 3D medical images is a difficult task due to the variability in object shape and pattern. Deep learning has been successful in this field, but Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have faced challenges due to the computational requirements and discrete optimization nature. Existing NAS methods have long search times and often result in sub-optimal network architectures. One-shot NAS has the potential to overcome these limitations, but its application in the segmentation domain is not well-studied. To address this, our method, called HyperSegNAS, introduces a HyperNet to assist super-net training by incorporating architecture topology information. The HyperNet can be removed once the super-net is trained, and it does not add overhead during architecture search. HyperSegNAS outperforms previous state-of-the-art segmentation networks, producing better performing and more intuitive architectures. It can also quickly and accurately find good architecture candidates under different computing constraints. Our method is evaluated on public datasets from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
