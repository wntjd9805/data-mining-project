Recent works in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) have utilized pre-training techniques. However, existing pre-training methods for VLN either lack the ability to predict future actions or disregard trajectory contexts, which are crucial for a successful navigation process. To address these limitations and enhance the learning of spatio-temporal visual-textual correspondence and decision-making abilities, we propose a new pre-training paradigm called History-and-Order aware pre-training (HOP). HOP incorporates VLN-specific objectives that leverage past observations and support future action prediction. In addition to the commonly used Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Trajectory-Instruction Matching (TIM), we introduce two proxy tasks, Trajectory Order Modeling (TOM) and Group Order Modeling (GOM), to capture temporal order information. Furthermore, we improve navigation action prediction by including the task of Action Prediction with History (APH), which considers the agent's history of visual perceptions. Through extensive experiments on four VLN tasks (R2R, REVERIE, NDH, RxR), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several state-of-the-art agents.
