Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has made significant advancements in generating realistic views of scenes using neural representations. However, NeRF is limited in its ability to handle complex reflections, such as those from glass and mirrors. This limitation leads to inaccurate depth estimation and blurry renderings when the multi-view consistency is violated. To address these issues, we propose NeRFReN, an extension of NeRF that can model scenes with reflections. NeRFReN splits a scene into transmitted and reflected components and models them separately using neural radiance fields. To ensure accurate decomposition, we incorporate geometric priors and employ carefully-designed training strategies. Experimental results on various scenes demonstrate that our method produces high-quality novel views and accurate depth estimation, making it suitable for scene editing applications.
