Despite the impressive performance of current semantic segmentation methods, they face challenges in adapting their models to newly discovered categories. Additionally, the process of annotating images pixel by pixel is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces a new framework called Weakly Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation, which aims to learn to segment new classes using easily accessible image-level labels. Unlike existing approaches that generate pseudo-labels offline, our framework utilizes a localizer that is trained with image-level labels and guided by the segmentation model to generate pseudo-supervision in real-time and update the model incrementally. To address the inherent noise in this process, we employ soft-labels generated by the localizer. Our approach is evaluated on the Pascal VOC and COCO datasets, and it outperforms weakly-supervised methods that operate offline while achieving results comparable to incremental learning methods that require full supervision.
