The purpose of semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) is to enhance the training and implementation of object detectors by utilizing a significant amount of unlabeled data. Existing SSOD methods mainly focus on anchor-based detectors, disregarding the demand for anchor-free detectors in real-world scenarios. This study aims to bridge this gap by introducing a DenSe Learning (DSL) algorithm for anchor-free SSOD. The proposed method incorporates innovative techniques such as Adaptive Filtering for accurate dense pixel-wise pseudo-label assignment, an Aggregated Teacher for generating stable and precise pseudo-labels, and an uncertainty-consistency-regularization term for improving the detector's generalization capability. Thorough experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate that the DSL method achieves state-of-the-art SSOD performance, surpassing existing methods significantly.
