Training semantic segmentation models requires a large amount of meticulously labeled data, making it difficult to adapt quickly to new classes that do not meet this requirement. Few-Shot Segmentation (FS-Seg) addresses this issue with several constraints. This paper presents a new benchmark called Generalized Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (GFS-Seg), which evaluates the ability to simultaneously segment both novel categories with limited examples and base categories with sufficient examples. It is the first study to demonstrate that previous state-of-the-art FS-Seg methods are inadequate in GFS-Seg, primarily due to the constrained setting of FS-Seg. To address this, we establish a GFS-Seg baseline that achieves decent performance without any structural changes to the original model. Additionally, we propose Context-Aware Prototype Learning (CAPL), which significantly enhances performance by leveraging co-occurrence prior knowledge from support samples and dynamically enriching contextual information for the classifier based on the content of each query image. Both contributions have been experimentally proven to have practical value. Extensive experiments conducted on Pascal-VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate that CAPL generalizes well to FS-Seg, achieving competitive performance.
