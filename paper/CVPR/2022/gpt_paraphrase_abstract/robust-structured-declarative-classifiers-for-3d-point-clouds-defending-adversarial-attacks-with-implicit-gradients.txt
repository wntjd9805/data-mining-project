Deep neural networks, such as PointNet, used for classifying 3D point clouds have been found to be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Current defense methods typically involve denoising the attacked point clouds through reconstruction before inputting them into the classifiers. In contrast, we propose a family of robust declarative classifiers that can effectively defend against adversarial attacks using implicit gradients. These classifiers can be formulated using a bilevel optimization framework. We also introduce an efficient instantiation of our approach called the Lattice Point Classifier (LPC), which combines structured sparse coding in the permutohedral lattice with 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). LPC is end-to-end trainable. We demonstrate superior performance in robust point cloud classification on the ModelNet40 and ScanNet datasets against seven different attackers. For example, our approach achieves test accuracies of 89.51% and 83.16% on each dataset respectively, when compared to the recent JGBA attacker, outperforming DUP-Net and IF-Defense with PointNet by approximately 70%.
