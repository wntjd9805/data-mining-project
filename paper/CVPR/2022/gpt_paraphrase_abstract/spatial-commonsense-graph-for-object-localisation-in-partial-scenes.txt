We address the problem of object localization in partial scenes, which involves estimating the unknown position of an object based on a partial 3D scan of the scene. Our approach utilizes a novel scene graph model called the Spatial Commonsense Graph (SCG). In this model, objects are represented as nodes, and pairwise distances between objects are represented as edges. Additionally, the SCG incorporates concept nodes and relationships from a common-sense knowledge base to enhance spatial inference in unknown 3D scenes. To estimate the position of the target object, we employ a two-step process. First, we input the SCG into a novel Proximity Prediction Network, a graph neural network that employs attention mechanisms to predict distances between the target object node and the nodes representing observed objects in the SCG. Second, we propose a Localisation Module based on circular intersection. This module utilizes all the predicted pairwise distances to estimate the object's position, ensuring independence from any reference system.To evaluate our method and compare it to existing approaches, we introduce a new dataset of partially reconstructed scenes. Our proposed method achieves the best performance in object localization in partial scenes.
