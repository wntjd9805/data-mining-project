Dashed curves are commonly used in drawing and illustration applications. Humans can easily recognize dashed curves by perceiving the continuity between disjoint curve segments, but this is challenging for computers. This is because recognizing dashed curves requires high-level semantic understanding, which is difficult for machines. Additionally, the various styles and backgrounds of dashed curves make the task even more complicated. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based framework that combines high-level features and low-level clues to recognize dashed curves. Our framework learns the computational analogy of the Gestalt Law in different domains, enabling it to locate and extract instances of dashed curves in raster and vector representations. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our framework is efficient and robust compared to existing solutions.
