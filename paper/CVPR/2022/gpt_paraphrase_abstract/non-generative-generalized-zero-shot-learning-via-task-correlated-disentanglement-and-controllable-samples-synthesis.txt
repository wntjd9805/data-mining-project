Synthesizing pseudo samples is the most effective method for solving the Generalized Zero Shot Learning (GZSL) problem. However, current models still face two challenges: (1) Feature confounding, where the overall representations mix task-correlated and task-independent features. Existing models address this by disentangling the features in a generative manner, but this approach is impractical with limited samples to synthesize reliable pseudo samples. (2) Distribution uncertainty, where existing models require a large amount of data to synthesize samples from uncertain distributions, resulting in poor performance when dealing with limited samples from seen classes. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a non-generative model consisting of two modules: (1) Task-correlated feature disentanglement, which separates task-correlated features from task-independent ones using adversarial learning of domain adaptation for reasonable synthesis. (2) Controllable pseudo sample synthesis, which generates edge-pseudo and center-pseudo samples with specific characteristics to enhance diversity and intuitive transfer. Additionally, a new Zero Shot Learning (ZSL) task called the 'Few-shot Seen class and Zero-shot Unseen class learning' (FSZU) is introduced to describe the scenario where the training process has limited samples from seen classes. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method in both GZSL and FSZU tasks.
