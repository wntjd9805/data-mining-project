We propose a new method for learning spatio-temporal correspondence in videos using Bayesian Model Averaging and self-cycle regularization within a self-supervised learning framework. Traditional methods for self-supervised correspondence learning are hindered by noisy labels and the presence of occlusion. To address this, we employ a probabilistic approach that handles model uncertainty in path selection on a complete graph. We introduce self-cycle regularization to ensure cycle-consistency on individual edges, preventing convergence on noisy or trivial solutions. Additionally, we utilize a mixture of sequential Bayesian filters to estimate posterior distribution for targets and a domain contrastive loss to learn discriminative representation among videos. Our algorithm is evaluated on various datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning based video correspondence algorithms, while also converging significantly faster.
