A method is proposed to predict the 3D shape and layout of objects in a 3D scene using 2D images. Most existing approaches require expensive 3D ground truth for training, but this method relies on multi-view images with 2D supervision, which can be easily collected at scale. The method is evaluated on ShapeNet, Hypersim, and ScanNet datasets and shows promising results compared to methods using 3D ground truth. In cases where reliable 3D ground truth is not available, the proposed method outperforms supervised approaches trained on smaller and less diverse datasets.
