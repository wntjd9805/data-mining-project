Interactive segmentation allows users to extract target masks by clicking positive or negative areas. However, existing models have limitations in terms of efficiency on low-power devices and their ability to refine preexisting masks without destroying the correct part. FocalClick addresses both issues by predicting and updating the mask in localized areas. To improve efficiency, the model performs fast inferences on small crops, including a coarse segmentation on the Target Crop and a local refinement on the Focus Crop. To enable the model to work with preexisting masks, a sub-task called Interactive Mask Correction is formulated, and the solution called Progressive Merge is proposed. Progressive Merge utilizes morphological information to determine which parts of the mask to preserve and update, allowing users to effectively refine any preexisting mask. FocalClick achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer floating-point operations. It also demonstrates significant superiority in correcting preexisting masks. The code and data for FocalClick are available at github.com/XavierCHEN34/ClickSEG.
