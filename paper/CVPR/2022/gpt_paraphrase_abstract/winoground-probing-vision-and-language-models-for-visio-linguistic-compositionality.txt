We introduce a new task and dataset called Winoground, designed to evaluate the ability of vision and language models in conducting visio-linguistic compositional reasoning. In this task, two images and two captions are provided, and the objective is to correctly match them. However, both captions consist of the same words, arranged in a different order. The dataset was meticulously curated by expert annotators and includes detailed tags for analyzing model performance. We evaluate several state-of-the-art vision and language models and surprisingly find that none of them perform significantly better than chance. This suggests that these models lack proficiency in visio-linguistic compositional reasoning. To address this limitation, we conduct a thorough analysis to gain insights that can guide future research. Our aim is for Winoground to serve as an invaluable evaluation set for advancing the field and fostering further progress.
