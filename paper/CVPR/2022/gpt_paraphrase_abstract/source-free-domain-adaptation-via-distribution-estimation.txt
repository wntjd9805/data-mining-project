Domain Adaptation, a technique that transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain with different data distributions, faces the challenge of unavailable training data in real-world applications due to privacy policies. To address this issue, Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has gained attention as it aims to solve the domain adaptation problem without using source data. In this study, we introduce a new framework called SFDA-DE, which utilizes source Distribution Estimation to tackle the SFDA task. Initially, we generate reliable pseudo-labels for the target data using spherical k-means clustering, with the initial class centers being the weight vectors (anchors) learned from the pretrained model's classifier. Additionally, we propose estimating the class-conditioned feature distribution of the source domain by leveraging the target data and corresponding anchors. We then sample surrogate features from this estimated distribution, which we utilize to align the two domains by minimizing a contrastive adaptation loss function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple Domain Adaptation benchmarks and even outperforms traditional methods that rely on abundant source data.
