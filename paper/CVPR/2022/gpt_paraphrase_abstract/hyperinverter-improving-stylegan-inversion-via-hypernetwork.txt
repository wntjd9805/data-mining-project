Recent advancements in real-world image manipulation have been remarkable, largely due to the exploration and utilization of GAN latent spaces. The initial step in this process is GAN inversion, which aims to accurately map real images to their corresponding latent codes. However, existing GAN inversion methods often fail to meet the three essential requirements: high reconstruction quality, editability, and fast inference. This research introduces a novel two-phase strategy that successfully fulfills all three requirements simultaneously. In the first phase, an encoder is trained to map input images to StyleGAN2 W-space, known for its excellent editability but relatively lower reconstruction quality. In the second phase, a series of hypernetworks are employed to recover the missing information during inversion, thereby enhancing the reconstruction ability achieved in the initial phase. These two steps complement each other, resulting in high reconstruction quality through the hypernetwork branch and excellent editability through the inversion conducted in the W-space. Notably, our approach is entirely encoder-based, leading to extremely fast inference. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging datasets validate the superiority of our method.
