This paper introduces a new method for constructing a cost volume in stereo matching. The method uses correlation clues to generate attention weights, which help suppress redundant information and improve matching-related information in the volume. To ensure reliable attention weights, a multi-level adaptive patch matching technique is proposed. The resulting cost volume, named attention concatenation volume (ACV), can be seamlessly integrated into various stereo matching networks. By using ACV, these networks can achieve higher accuracy with a more lightweight aggregation network, requiring only a fraction of the parameters compared to previous approaches. Additionally, the authors present ACVNet, a highly accurate network based on ACV, which outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks. The code for ACVNet is available at the provided GitHub repository.
