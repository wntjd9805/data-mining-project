The precise prediction of trajectories requires understanding the interactions among multiple agents based on their past trajectories. However, previous studies have only considered pairwise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose GroupNet, a novel multiscale hypergraph neural network that captures interactions and learns their representations comprehensively. GroupNet utilizes a trainable multiscale hypergraph to capture both pairwise and group-wise interactions at different group sizes. It also introduces a three-element format for representation learning, which allows for the explicit reasoning of relational factors such as interaction strength and category. We evaluate GroupNet in both CVAE-based prediction systems and existing state-of-the-art prediction systems. Synthetic physics simulations are used to assess its ability to capture group behaviors, interaction strength, and category. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world trajectory prediction datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) to validate the effectiveness of the prediction. The results demonstrate that GroupNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the CVAE-based prediction system. Moreover, integrating GroupNet into existing state-of-the-art prediction systems further improves their performance.
