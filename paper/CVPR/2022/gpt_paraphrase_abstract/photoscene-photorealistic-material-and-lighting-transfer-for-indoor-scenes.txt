This study introduces a framework called PhotoScene1, which aims to create realistic digital replicas of indoor scenes by combining input images of the scene with CAD geometry. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on reconstructing 3D geometry and scene layout, PhotoScene1 goes further by incorporating high-quality materials and similar lighting to enhance the realism of the digital twin. Procedural material graphs are utilized to model the scene materials, allowing for photorealistic and resolution-independent representations. By optimizing the parameters of these graphs, as well as the texture scale, rotation, and scene lighting, the framework ensures the best possible match with the input image through differentiable rendering. The effectiveness of PhotoScene1 is demonstrated through evaluations on reconstructions from various datasets, including ScanNet, SUN RGB-D, and stock photographs. The results exhibit the ability of the method to generate fully relightable 3D scenes of high quality, which can be re-rendered from any viewpoint, zoom level, and lighting condition.
