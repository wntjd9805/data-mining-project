Accurately predicting the long-term trajectories of multiple agents in complex scenes is a difficult task. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE-VAE, a new modeling framework that uses a cascade of Conditional VAEs. This framework takes a coarse-to-fine approach to forecasting, learning a joint representation of the environment and agent movements in the Macro stage to predict long and short term motion goals. In the Micro stage, the model learns a detailed spatio-temporal representation for predicting individual agent trajectories. By utilizing VAE backbones in both stages, MUSE-VAE is able to account for uncertainty at different levels of granularity. This results in diverse and more accurate predictions compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments on nuScenes, SDD benchmarks, and PFSD, a synthetic dataset, demonstrate the effectiveness of MUSE-VAE in complex agent-environment interaction scenarios.
