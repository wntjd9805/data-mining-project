A new model for efficient parallel hyper-parameter optimization is proposed using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The model, called Attention and Memory Enhancement (AME), incorporates multi-head attention and memory mechanisms to capture both short-term and long-term relationships between different hyper-parameter configurations. This allows for the identification of high-performance configurations within a large search space. To address the issue of insufficient samples due to untimely feedback, a powerful strategy is applied during the optimization process. Experimental results on three visual tasks (image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation) validate the effectiveness of the AME model.
