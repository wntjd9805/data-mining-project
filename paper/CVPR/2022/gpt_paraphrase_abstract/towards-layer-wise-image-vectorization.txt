Image vectorization, the process of converting raster images to scalable vector graphics (SVGs), is a challenging task in computer graphics. While deep learning models have made significant advancements in generating vector graphs, they struggle to generalize well to different types of data and often produce complex and redundant shapes. Furthermore, the underlying topology and semantics of images are not well understood and have not been fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a new approach called Layer-wise Image Vectorization (LIVE). LIVE aims to convert raster images to SVGs while preserving the image topology. It generates compact SVG forms with layer-wise structures that are consistent with human perception. This is achieved by progressively adding new BÃ©zier paths and optimizing them using a layer-wise framework, newly designed loss functions, and component-wise path initialization technique.Our experiments show that LIVE produces more realistic vectorized forms compared to previous methods and can be applied to new images. By learning the underlying image topology, LIVE enables the creation of editable SVGs for designers and other applications. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/LIVE-Layerwise-Image-Vectorization.
