The current methods for estimating the 3D pose of multiple people rely on a two-stage approach, either top-down or bottom-up, which leads to redundant processes and high computational costs. We propose a more efficient single-stage solution called Decoupled Regression Model (DRM) with three key innovations. Firstly, DRM introduces a new representation for 3D pose that separates the 2D pose in the image plane and the depth information of each person using the center point and root point. Secondly, to improve the feature representation for depth regression, DRM incorporates a 2D Pose-guided Depth Query Module (PDQM) that extracts features from the 2D pose regression branch, enabling the depth regression branch to capture scale information. Lastly, DRM utilizes a Decoupled Absolute Pose Loss (DAPL) to enhance the accuracy of absolute 3D pose estimation by facilitating root depth estimation. Our comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including MuPoTS-3D and Panoptic, demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing bottom-up absolute 3D pose estimation methods.
