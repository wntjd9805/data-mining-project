FocalPose is a new method that uses neural rendering and comparison to estimate the camera-object 6D pose and camera focal length based on a single RGB image of a known object. The main contributions of this research are twofold. Firstly, it introduces a focal length update rule that expands upon a previous state-of-the-art pose estimator to address the joint estimation task. Secondly, it explores different loss functions for the simultaneous estimation of object pose and focal length. The study finds that combining direct focal length regression with a re-projection loss, which separates the effects of translation, rotation, and focal length, yields improved results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on three challenging benchmark datasets featuring known 3D models in uncontrolled environments. The results indicate that the estimated focal length and 6D pose have lower error compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
