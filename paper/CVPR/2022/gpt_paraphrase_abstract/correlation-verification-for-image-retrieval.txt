We introduce CVNet, a new image retrieval re-ranking network that utilizes geometric verification. CVNet consists of 4D convolutional layers that compress dense feature correlation into image similarity, while also learning diverse geometric matching patterns from different image pairs. To enable cross-scale matching, CVNet builds feature pyramids and constructs cross-scale feature correlations within a single inference, eliminating the need for multiple scale inferences. Additionally, curriculum learning with hard negative mining and the Hide-and-Seek strategy are employed to handle challenging samples. Our re-ranking network outperforms existing methods by a significant margin (+12.6% in mAP on the ROxford-Hard+1M set) and is available online with source code and models at https://github.com/sungonce/CVNet.
