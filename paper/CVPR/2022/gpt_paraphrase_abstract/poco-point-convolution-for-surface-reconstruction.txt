We present a novel approach to surface reconstruction from point clouds using implicit neural networks. Existing methods encode the isosurface function into a single latent vector, leading to scalability issues. To address this, we propose computing latent vectors at each input point using point cloud convolutions. This allows us to maintain a direct connection with the input points on the surface and focus on important areas near the surface. We also introduce a learning-based interpolation method to improve the accuracy of occupancy queries. Our experiments on object and scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other methods in terms of classical metrics, producing finer details and better reconstructions of thinner volumes. The code for our approach is publicly available.
