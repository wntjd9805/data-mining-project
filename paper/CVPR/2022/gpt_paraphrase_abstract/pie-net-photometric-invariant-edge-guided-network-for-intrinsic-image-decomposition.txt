This paper presents a novel approach to intrinsic image decomposition, which involves recovering the reflectance and shading components of an image. Existing methods rely on explicit priors or implicit constraints through deep learning, but they can be affected by strong illumination conditions that cause shading-reflectance leakages. To address this issue, the proposed approach utilizes an end-to-end edge-driven hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN). The edges in the image are used as illumination invariant gradients. A hierarchical approach is employed to handle challenging illumination transitions, incorporating global and local refinement layers. Attention layers are also incorporated to enhance the learning process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments and an ablation study. The results show that using illumination invariant descriptors and separating global and local cues improve the performance of the network. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates good generalization to real-world images.
