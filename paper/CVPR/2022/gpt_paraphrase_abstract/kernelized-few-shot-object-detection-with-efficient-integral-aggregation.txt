We present a novel approach for designing a Kernelized Few-shot Object Detector. Our method involves using kernelized matrices computed over multiple proposal regions to create expressive non-linear representations. These representations have a learned model complexity, allowing for flexibility in the detection process. Our pipeline consists of several modules. First, an Encoding Network is used to encode both the support and query images. Then, our Kernelized Auto-correlation unit generates linear, polynomial, and RBF kernelized representations by extracting features from the support regions of the support images. These features are then cross-correlated with the features of the query image to obtain attention weights. Next, an Attention Region Proposal Net generates query proposal regions based on the attention weights. Since there are multiple query proposal regions, each described by the linear, polynomial, and RBF kernelized matrices, the formation of these regions can be computationally expensive. However, we propose a solution called the Integral Region-of-Interest Aggregation unit, which reduces the cost of forming these regions. Finally, our Multi-head Relation Net combines all the kernelized representations with the first-order feature maps to learn the relations and locations of the support-query classes. In our experiments, we have achieved superior performance compared to the state of the art on novel classes. We have improved the mean average precision (mAP) by 3.8% on PASCAL VOC 2007, 5.4% on FSOD, and 5.7% on COCO.
