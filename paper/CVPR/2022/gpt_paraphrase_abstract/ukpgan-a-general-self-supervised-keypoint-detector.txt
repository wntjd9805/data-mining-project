We introduce UKPGAN, a self-supervised 3D keypoint detector that treats keypoint detection as information compression. By distilling important points of an object, UKPGAN can reconstruct the original object shape. Our approach includes two modules: a GAN-based keypoint sparsity control and a salient information distillation module. Experimental results demonstrate that our detected keypoints align well with human annotated keypoint labels and can be effectively used for SMPL human bodies with non-rigid deformations. Additionally, our keypoint detector trained on clean object collections performs well in real-world scenarios, improving geometric registration when combined with off-the-shelf point descriptors. Repeatability experiments confirm the stability of our model under both rigid and non-rigid transformations, with local reference frame estimation.
