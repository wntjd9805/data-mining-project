Active learning is a promising solution for reducing the high cost of annotating data in computer vision tasks. However, active learning for object detection is a more challenging problem and there are few existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach to tackle this issue. Our approach considers both instance-level uncertainty and diversity in a bottom-up manner. To manage computational complexity, we design a two-stage procedure. In the first stage, we introduce an entropy-based non-maximum suppression (ENMS) method to estimate the uncertainty of each image. ENMS removes redundant predictions by applying non-maximum suppression based on entropy in the feature space. In the second stage, we explore a diverse prototype (DivProto) strategy to ensure diversity across images by progressively converting it into intra-class and inter-class diversities using entropy-based class-specific prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments on MS COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, and our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms other methods, demonstrating its superiority in object detection.
