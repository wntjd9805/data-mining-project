Pedestrian counting is a crucial tool for understanding pedestrian behavior and analyzing crowd flow. Existing methods either focus on counting pedestrians at the image level or rely on manual annotation of lines. In this study, we propose a new approach called Video Individual Counting (VIC) which counts the total number of individual pedestrians in a given video, ensuring that each person is only counted once. Instead of using Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) techniques, we decompose the pedestrians into initial pedestrians from the first frame and new pedestrians with separate identities in each subsequent frame. We then use an end-to-end Decomposition and Reasoning Network (DRNet) to estimate the initial pedestrian count using density estimation, and determine the count of new pedestrians in each frame using differentiable optimal transport. We conducted extensive experiments on two datasets with crowded pedestrian scenarios and diverse scenes, and our method outperformed baseline approaches in accurately counting individual pedestrians.
