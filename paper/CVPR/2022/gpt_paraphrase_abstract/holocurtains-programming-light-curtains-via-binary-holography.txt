This study introduces a new approach called Holocurtains that allows for the creation of light curtains with arbitrary shapes. Traditional light curtains are limited to straight lines, but Holocurtains use a rolling-shutter camera and a holographic projector to generate bright structured light patterns. The system utilizes a binary digital micromirror device (DMD) to produce holographic interference patterns quickly. This innovation enables the generation of 3D light curtains that were not possible with previous methods. The Holocurtains system has various applications, such as capturing multiple light curtains simultaneously in one frame, detecting subtle scene geometry changes, and transforming any 3D surface into an optical touch interface.
