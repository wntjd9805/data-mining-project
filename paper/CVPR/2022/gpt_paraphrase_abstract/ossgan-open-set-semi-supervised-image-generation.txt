We present a novel training approach for conditional GANs called open-set semi-supervised image generation. In this approach, the training dataset consists of labeled data and unlabeled data, which includes both samples belonging to labeled data classes (closed-set) and samples not belonging to any labeled data class (open-set). This differs from existing semi-supervised image generation tasks where unlabeled data only includes closed-set samples. Our approach is more practical and cost-effective as it allows open-set samples. By utilizing entropy regularization, the classifier trained on labeled data can determine the importance of each sample as confidence for training the cGAN. This enables us to utilize all samples in the unlabeled data. We propose a method called OSSGAN that provides decision clues to the discriminator based on whether an unlabeled image belongs to one of the classes of interest or none. This allows smooth integration of labeled and unlabeled data during training. Experimental results on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet demonstrate significant improvements over supervised Big-GAN and other semi-supervised methods.
