This paper introduces a new approach to single image super-resolution (SISR) by zooming an image from RAW to RAW within the camera imaging pipeline. This approach bridges the gap between ideal and real degradation models by operating in the RAW-to-RAW domain and excluding the image signal processing pipeline. The proposed method uses two convolutional neural networks to learn the high-resolution image and the degradation model in lower-dimensional subspaces, converting the ill-posed SISR problem into a well-posed one. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and the RAW-to-RAW domain, evaluations are conducted on the RealSR and SR-RAW datasets. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques both qualitatively and quantitatively, and it also generalizes well across different sensors, enabling zero-shot transfer.
