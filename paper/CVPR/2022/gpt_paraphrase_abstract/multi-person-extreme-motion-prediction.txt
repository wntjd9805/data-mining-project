This study focuses on the problem of predicting the future motion of two interacting persons in collaborative tasks using their past skeletons. While previous research has mainly addressed motion prediction for single individuals, we propose a novel cross interaction attention mechanism that leverages historical information from both individuals to predict cross dependencies between their pose sequences. To train our model, we collected a new dataset called ExPI, which consists of 115 sequences of professional dancers performing Lindy-hop dancing actions, annotated with 3D body poses and shapes. We evaluate our cross interaction network on this dataset and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for single-person motion prediction in both short- and long-term predictions. The code and dataset are available for public use at the provided link.
