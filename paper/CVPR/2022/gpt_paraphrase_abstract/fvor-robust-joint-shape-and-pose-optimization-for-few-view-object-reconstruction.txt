Reconstructing a precise 3D object model from a limited number of image observations is still a difficult task in the field of computer vision. Current approaches rely on accurate camera poses as input, which can be challenging to obtain in real-world scenarios. This study introduces FvOR, a learning-based method for object reconstruction that can predict accurate 3D models even when provided with noisy input poses. The key aspect of this approach is a fast and robust algorithm that combines multi-view reconstruction and camera pose estimation through the use of neural network modules. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark on ShapeNet, comparing it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in terms of accuracy. Additionally, it is significantly faster than the recent optimization-based approach IDR.
