This paper introduces two new modules, focal sparse convolution (Focal Conv) and focal sparse convolution with fusion (Focal Conv-F), to enhance the performance of Sparse CNNs in 3D object detection. These modules make feature sparsity learnable with position-wise importance prediction. They can replace existing basic components in Sparse CNNs and be trained together in an end-to-end manner. The paper demonstrates that spatially learnable sparsity is crucial for advanced 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which outperforms existing single-model entries on the nuScenes test benchmark. The code and models are available on GitHub at github.com/dvlab-research/FocalsConv.
