Spotting graphical symbols in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings is crucial for various industrial applications. Unlike raster images, CAD drawings are made up of vector graphics that consist of geometric shapes such as segments, arcs, and circles. We propose a new graph attention network called GAT-CADNet to address the problem of panoptic symbol spotting by treating each CAD drawing as a graph. In this network, vertex features obtained from the GAT branch are mapped to semantic labels, and their attention scores are used to predict instances. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we formulate the instance symbol spotting task as a subgraph detection problem and solve it by predicting the adjacency matrix; 2) we introduce a relative spatial encoding module that explicitly encodes the relative positional and geometric relationships between vertices to enhance vertex attention; 3) we develop a cascaded edge encoding module that extracts vertex attention from multiple stages of GAT and uses it as edge encoding to predict the adjacency matrix. GAT-CADNet is intuitive yet effective, providing a consolidated network to solve the panoptic symbol spotting problem. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that our graph-based approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods significantly. Figure 1 illustrates a floor plan with panoptic symbol spotting results, where line semantics are color-coded and instances are represented by translucent rectangles. The annotated floor plan can be used to reconstruct a Building Information Model (BIM) model with complete semantic and accurate geometry. For the sake of clarity, only the 3D models of walls, windows, and doors are shown in the BIM model.
