Predictive learning aims to create a model of physical processes in various environments. However, in real-world scenarios, prediction tasks may occur sequentially, leading to persistent changes in the environments during training. This raises the question of whether predictive learning algorithms can handle non-stationary environments. This paper focuses on the problem of continual learning in video prediction and identifies that existing methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting in this context. To address this issue, the authors propose the continual predictive learning (CPL) approach. CPL utilizes predictive experience replay and non-parametric task inference to learn a mixture world model and adapt at test time. To evaluate the effectiveness of their approach, the authors introduce two new benchmarks based on RoboNet and KTH. These benchmarks represent different physical robotic environments and human actions as tasks. The results show that CPL successfully mitigates forgetting and significantly outperforms previous methods in video prediction and continual learning.
