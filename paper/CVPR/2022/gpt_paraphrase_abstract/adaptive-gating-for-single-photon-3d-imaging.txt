Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are increasingly used for depth sensing, but they struggle with high ambient light due to pile-up effects. Existing techniques for mitigating pile-up, such as fixed or asynchronous gating, are non-adaptive and cannot consider scene priors or previous photon detections. We propose an adaptive gating scheme based on Thompson sampling. This scheme updates the gate position periodically using prior photon observations to minimize depth errors. Our experiments demonstrate that our gating strategy significantly reduces depth reconstruction error and acquisition time, even in outdoor settings with strong sunlight.
