Modern object detectors have made impressive advancements in close-set object detection. However, open-set object detection (OSOD) remains a challenge as unknown objects are often misclassified as known classes. In this study, we propose a method to identify unknown objects by separating high and low-density regions in the latent space. It is widely accepted that unknown objects are typically distributed in low-density regions. Traditional threshold-based approaches only maintain limited low-density regions, which fails to cover all unknown objects. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Open-set Detector (OpenDet) that expands the low-density regions. OpenDet consists of two learners: Contrastive Feature Learner (CFL) and Unknown Probability Learner (UPL). CFL utilizes instance-level contrastive learning to encourage compact features of known classes, thereby creating more low-density regions for unknown classes. UPL optimizes the unknown probability based on prediction uncertainty, further dividing additional low-density regions around the cluster of known classes. As a result, unknown objects in low-density regions can be easily identified using the learned unknown probability. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves OSOD performance. For instance, OpenDet reduces the Absolute Open-Set Errors by 25%-35% across six OSOD benchmarks.
