The video anomaly detection problem can be effectively addressed using multiple-instance learning (MIL), which treats it as a weakly supervised task due to limited frame-level labels. To enhance the training of MIL models and improve anomaly detection in practical scenarios with outlier segments or various abnormal events, we introduce a novel method called Bayesian non-parametric submodular video partition (BN-SVP). BN-SVP utilizes dynamic non-parametric hierarchical clustering with an enhanced self-transition to group video segments into temporally consistent and semantically coherent hidden states resembling scenes. Each segment is generated through a non-parametric mixture process, accommodating the dynamic and noisy nature of real-world surveillance videos. The scene and mixture component assignment in BN-SVP also establishes pairwise similarity among segments, leading to the construction of a non-parametric submodular set function. By integrating this function with an MIL loss, the model is exposed to a diverse set of potentially positive instances, thereby improving its training. To optimize the submodular function and facilitate efficient model training, we develop a greedy algorithm. The proposed algorithm is theoretically analyzed and guarantees strong performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on multiple real-world anomaly video datasets, achieving robust detection performance.
