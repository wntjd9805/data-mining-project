This paper introduces a new approach to deformable image registration (DIR) using neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs). The proposed framework models each voxel as a moving particle in a high-dimensional dynamical system, with the trajectory determining the desired deformation field. Deep neural networks are employed to model the dynamical system and optimize the transformation between image pairs. The method allows for the imposition of constraints along the transformation to ensure desired regularities. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, and the potential for extending the framework to register multiple image sets using a unified transformation.
