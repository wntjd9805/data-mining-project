This study examines the impact of adversarial perturbations on deep stereo matching networks used for the task of estimating disparities in images. The researchers propose a method to create a universal set of perturbations that can deceive a stereo network and significantly alter the perceived scene geometry when applied to any stereo image pair in a dataset. These perturbation images are not only effective on the dataset they are optimized for, but they also generalize to different network architectures trained on different datasets. The approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets, and the perturbations are found to increase the D1-error (a measure of fooling rate) of state-of-the-art stereo networks from 1% to as high as 87%. The researchers also analyze the impact of the perturbations on the estimated scene geometry and identify the object classes that are most vulnerable. Through an analysis of the activations of registered points between left and right images, architectural components that enhance robustness against adversaries are discovered. Incorporating these components into network designs can reduce the effect of adversaries by up to 60.5%, which is comparable to the robustness achieved through costly adversarial data augmentation. Furthermore, this design principle improves the networks' robustness against common image corruptions by an average of 70%.
