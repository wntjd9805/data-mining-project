Energy-based latent variable models (EBLVMs) are more expressive than traditional energy-based models, but their effectiveness in visual tasks is limited due to the challenging training process that involves sampling from two intractable distributions. To address this limitation, we propose Bi-level doubly variational learning (BiDVL) in this study. BiDVL is based on a novel bi-level optimization framework and utilizes two tractable variational distributions to facilitate the learning of EBLVMs. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled EBLVM comprising a marginal energy-based distribution and a structural posterior, which helps overcome the difficulties encountered when training deep EBLVMs on images. By employing a symmetric KL divergence in the lower level of our framework, we obtain a compact BiDVL model suitable for visual tasks. Our proposed model achieves impressive image generation performance compared to existing methods. Additionally, it demonstrates notable capabilities in image reconstruction and out-of-distribution detection.
