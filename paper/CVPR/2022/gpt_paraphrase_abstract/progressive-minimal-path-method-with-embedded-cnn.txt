We propose Path-CNN, a new approach for segmenting the centerlines of tubular structures. This method combines the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the progressive minimal path method. While minimal path methods are commonly used for centerline segmentation, they often rely on manually designed image features. In contrast, CNNs automatically learn strong image features from data. However, CNNs typically do not consider the topology of the results and require a large amount of annotated training data.  To address these limitations, we integrate CNNs into the minimal path method. This integration allows both techniques to benefit from each other. CNNs utilize learned image features to improve the determination of minimal paths, while the minimal path method ensures the correct topology of the segmented centerlines. Additionally, the minimal path method provides strong geometric priors, enhancing the performance of CNNs, and significantly reducing the need for annotations during training.   Compared to recent methods, our approach has lower hardware requirements. Through qualitative and quantitative comparisons with other methods, we demonstrate that Path-CNN achieves superior performance, particularly when dealing with complex-shaped tubular structures in challenging environments. Overall, our method offers an efficient and effective solution for centerline segmentation.
