Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in face recognition, but the data used to train them is often imbalanced. Previous research has mainly focused on the long-tailed nature of face datasets in terms of data volume per identity or single bias variation. In this paper, we demonstrate that various bias variations, such as ethnicity, head pose, occlusion, and blur, can all significantly affect accuracy. To address this, we propose a sample level weighting approach called Multi-variation Cosine Margin (MvCoM), which considers multiple variation factors simultaneously. This approach enhances face recognition losses to incorporate the importance of training samples. Additionally, we utilize a learning to learn approach guided by a held-out meta learning set and employ additive modeling to predict the MvCoM. Through extensive experiments on challenging face recognition benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of our method in handling imbalances caused by multiple variations.
