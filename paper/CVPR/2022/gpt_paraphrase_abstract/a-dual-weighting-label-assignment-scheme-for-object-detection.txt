Existing methods for label assignment in object detection focus on designing a positive weight function, while the negative weight is derived from the positive weight. This approach limits the learning capacity of detectors. In this paper, we propose a new weighting paradigm called dual weighting (DW) to assign separate positive and negative weights. We analyze evaluation metrics in object detection to identify key factors influencing the weights. Based on these factors, we design weighting functions for positive and negative samples. The positive weight is determined by the consistency between a sample's classification and localization scores, while the negative weight is decomposed into two terms: the probability of being a negative sample and its importance conditioned on being negative. This flexible weighting strategy allows for better differentiation between important and less important samples, resulting in a more effective object detector. By applying the proposed DW method, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector achieves a 41.5% mean average precision (mAP) on COCO under a 1Ã— schedule, outperforming other existing label assignment methods. Our approach consistently improves baseline performance on COCO with various backbones, without any additional enhancements. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/strongwolf/DW.
