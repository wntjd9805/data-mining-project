The difficulty of training conventional models directly on large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs) due to their gigapixel size has led to the adoption of multiple-instance learning (MIL) in current approaches. One significant branch combines MIL with graph convolutional network (GCN), treating sampled patches as graph nodes to uncover their correlations. However, establishing correspondence between patches from different WSIs is challenging, leading to the use of non-ordered node pooling in most methods to generate bag-level representation. Unfortunately, direct non-ordered pooling results in the loss of crucial structural and contextual information essential for WSI representation, such as patch distribution and heterogeneous patterns. To address this issue, we propose a hierarchical global-to-local clustering strategy for constructing a Node-Aligned GCN (NAGCN) that represents WSIs with rich local structural information and global distribution. Our approach involves global clustering based on instance features to establish correspondence across WSIs, followed by local clustering-based sampling to select representative instances from each cluster within the WSI. We then employ graph convolution to obtain the representation. By ensuring alignment among different WSIs in our graph construction strategy, we can easily generate WSI-level representation for subsequent classification tasks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of performance, as demonstrated by experiments on two cancer subtype classification datasets.
