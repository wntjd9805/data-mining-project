Image manipulation detection algorithms often struggle to generalize to images manipulated with Generative Models (GMs) that were not seen during training. In contrast to conventional detection algorithms, we propose a proactive approach to image manipulation detection. Our approach involves estimating a set of templates that, when added to a real image, improve the accuracy of manipulation detection. We use certain constraints to estimate these templates based on desired properties. By comparing a template-protected real image with its manipulated version, we achieve better discrimination compared to comparing the original real image with its manipulated version. Our approach shows significant improvement over prior work, with an average precision increase of 16% for CycleGAN and 32% for GauGAN in image manipulation detection. Additionally, our method is generalizable to various GMs, resulting in an average precision increase of 10% across 12 GMs. The code for our approach is available at https://www.github.com/vishal3477/proactive_IMD.
