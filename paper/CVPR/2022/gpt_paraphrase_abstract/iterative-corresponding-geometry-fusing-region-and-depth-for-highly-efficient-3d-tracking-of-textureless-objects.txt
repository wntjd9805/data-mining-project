A new probabilistic tracker called ICG is proposed in this study for tracking objects in 3D space and predicting their 6DoF pose in computer vision. Existing approaches rely on object texture, but this assumption fails for objects with insufficient texture. ICG overcomes this limitation by fusing region and depth information and using object geometry alone. The method utilizes correspondence lines and points to iteratively refine the pose and includes robust occlusion handling for improved performance in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that ICG outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness, even for textured objects. Furthermore, ICG exhibits fast convergence and exceptional efficiency, requiring only 1.3 ms per frame on a single CPU core. The study also analyzes the impact of individual components and compares the performance of ICG with deep learning-based methods. The source code of the tracker is publicly available.
