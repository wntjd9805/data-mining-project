We propose a framework called Harmony that can disentangle images into semantic content factors and transformations. This is particularly useful in biomedical research, where objects undergo changes in visual properties while the semantic content remains the same. Harmony uses a cross-contrastive learning framework with multiple parameterized latent representations to achieve this disentanglement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Harmony by applying it to various image datasets and achieving improved disentanglement compared to baseline models. Harmony is also capable of modeling structural heterogeneity of macromolecules and learning transformation-invariant representations in bioimage analysis. It performs well in disentangling content from 3D transformations and can align 3D cryo-ET subtomograms quickly. Additionally, Harmony is applicable to other imaging domains and has the potential to be extended beyond imaging.
