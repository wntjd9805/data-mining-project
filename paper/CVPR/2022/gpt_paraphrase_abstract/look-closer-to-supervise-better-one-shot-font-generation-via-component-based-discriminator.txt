The challenge of automatic font generation is due to the complexity of character structures and the limited number of samples available for reference. Previous studies have struggled to preserve local style patterns and detailed glyph structures using a coarse-grained discriminator. In this study, we propose a Component-Aware Module (CAM) that supervises the font generator at a more fine-grained level, decoupling content and style at the component level. Instead of increasing the complexity of the generator, we aim to provide more effective supervision for a relatively simple generator. This new perspective, which we call Component-Guided GAN (CG-GAN), achieves remarkable results by combining component-level supervision with adversarial learning. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art one-shot font generation methods and can also be applied to handwritten word synthesis and scene text image editing, demonstrating its generalization capabilities.
