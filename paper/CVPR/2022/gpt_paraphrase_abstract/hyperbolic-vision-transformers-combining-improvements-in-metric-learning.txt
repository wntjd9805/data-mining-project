Metric learning aims to create a model that encourages similar classes to have close embeddings in the chosen metrics, while pushing apart dissimilar classes. This is typically achieved by using an encoder to extract embeddings and a distance-based loss function, often the Euclidean distance. Recently, there has been growing interest in using hyperbolic geometry for learning embeddings of natural data. In line with this, we propose a new hyperbolic-based model for metric learning. Our approach utilizes a vision transformer to generate embeddings that are mapped to hyperbolic space. These embeddings are then optimized using a modified pairwise cross-entropy loss. We evaluate our model on four datasets using six different formulations and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The source code for our model is available at https://github.com/htdt/hyp_metric.
