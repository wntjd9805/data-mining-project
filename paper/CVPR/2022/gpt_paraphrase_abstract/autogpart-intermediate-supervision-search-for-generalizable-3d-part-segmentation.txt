Training a 3D part segmentation network that can be applied to various real-world applications is a challenging task. Some approaches attempt to design task-specific solutions based on human understanding, but this runs the risk of overlooking the optimal strategy as machines do not have the same understanding as humans. Other approaches use task-agnostic methods designed for domain generalization problems without considering task-specific knowledge. In order to address these challenges, we propose AutoGPart, a method that allows for the training of generalizable 3D part segmentation networks while considering task-specific knowledge. AutoGPart creates a supervision space that incorporates geometric prior knowledge and enables the machine to automatically search for optimal supervisions for a given segmentation task. We conduct extensive experiments on three different 3D part segmentation tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AutoGPart. The results show that simple backbone segmentation networks can achieve significantly improved performance when trained with supervisions obtained through our method.
