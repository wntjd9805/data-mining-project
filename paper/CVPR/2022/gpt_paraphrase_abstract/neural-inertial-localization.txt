This paper introduces the concept of inertial localization, which involves determining the absolute location using data from inertial sensors. The authors present a comprehensive dataset consisting of 53 hours of inertial sensor data along with corresponding ground truth locations. They propose a solution called neural inertial localization (NILoc) that leverages a neural inertial navigation technique to convert the sensor data into a sequence of velocity vectors. A transformer-based neural architecture is then used to estimate the device's location based on this velocity sequence. The proposed approach only utilizes an IMU sensor, making it energy efficient and privacy-preserving compared to other data sources like WiFi and cameras. Despite not requiring a floorplan and being faster, the NILoc method achieves competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art approaches, which are 20 to 30 times slower. The authors provide the code, model, and data for their solution at https://sachini.github.io/niloc.
