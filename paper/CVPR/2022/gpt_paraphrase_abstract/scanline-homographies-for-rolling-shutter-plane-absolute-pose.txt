Cameras on portable devices use a rolling-shutter mechanism where image rows are read out sequentially. This causes motion-related distortions known as RS effects. Existing literature solves this problem by making assumptions about camera motion. However, in this study, we propose a solution to the absolute pose problem without relying on motion assumptions. We introduce a new mathematical concept called the scanline-homography, which is a 3x2 matrix with 5 degrees of freedom, for RS cameras observing a planar scene. By establishing the relationship between scanline-homography and the corresponding plane-homography, a 3x3 matrix with 6 degrees of freedom, we can estimate the scanline-homographies of an RS frame using a smooth image warp technique. We then recover the plane-homographies to obtain the scanline-poses based on motion smoothness. Our claims are supported by various experiments.
