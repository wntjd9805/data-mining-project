This paper introduces a new approach to time-of-flight (ToF) imaging, a technology commonly used in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Conventional ToF imaging methods rely on measuring the time it takes for the first-arriving photons to reflect back from a scene surface, while disregarding all subsequent photons as noise. In contrast, this paper proposes an all-photon ToF imaging method that analyzes both the first-arriving and late-arriving photons using temporal-polarimetric analysis. By considering all photons captured by the system, this method is able to extract rich scene information related to geometry and material properties. The proposed approach includes a novel temporal-polarimetric reflectance model, an efficient capture method, and a reconstruction method that leverages the temporal-polarimetric changes of light. Compared to conventional ToF imaging, this all-photon polarimetric ToF imaging method is capable of acquiring more detailed information, including depth, surface normals, and material parameters. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results using a prototype system.
