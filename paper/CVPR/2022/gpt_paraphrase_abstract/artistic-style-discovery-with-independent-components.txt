In recent years, style transfer has been extensively researched, resulting in impressive performance. However, most existing methods focus on using CNNs for stylization, neglecting exploration of the latent style space. This lack of exploration leads to poor control over style and limits practical applications. This study reconsiders the meaning of style features and presents an unsupervised algorithm for style discovery and personalized manipulation. By examining the mechanism of style transfer, we identify different artistic style components in the latent space. We can then generate new styles by combining these components linearly. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in restyling outputs with diverse artistic styles while preserving the original content. Furthermore, our method is compatible with various style transfer techniques. The code for our algorithm is available at https://github.com/Shelsin/ArtIns.
