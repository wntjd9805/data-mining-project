This paper introduces TransMVSNet, a novel approach for feature matching in multi-view stereo (MVS) tasks. The authors propose the use of a Feature Matching Transformer (FMT) that utilizes intra- and inter-attention mechanisms to capture long-range contextual information within and across images. To enhance the adaptation of the FMT, an Adaptive Receptive Field (ARF) module is employed to ensure smooth transitions in feature scopes and connect different stages with a feature pathway. Pair-wise feature correlation is employed to measure feature similarity, and an ambiguity-reducing focal loss is applied to improve supervision. Notably, this is the first attempt to incorporate Transformers into MVS tasks. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets including DTU, Tanks and Temples, and BlendedMVS.
