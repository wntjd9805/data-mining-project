Little attention has been given to the problem of human pose estimation from multiple cameras with unknown calibration in the era of deep learning. We demonstrate a neural model that can be trained to achieve high precision and minimal latency overhead for this task. Our model addresses the uncertainty of joint location caused by occlusion from different viewpoints and only requires 2D keypoint data for training. Through experiments on the Human3.6M dataset and the Ski-Pose PTZ dataset, which pose more challenges, we prove that our method outperforms classical bundle adjustment and weakly-supervised monocular 3D baselines.
