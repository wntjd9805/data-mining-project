Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a challenging task that aims to recognize unseen compositions formed from known state and object combinations. Existing methods either use separate classifiers for state and object recognition, ignoring the interaction between them, or try to learn a joint representation that creates a domain gap between seen and unseen compositions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Siamese Contrastive Embedding Network (SCEN) for recognizing unseen compositions. Our method considers the entanglement between state and object by embedding visual features into a Siamese Contrastive Space, capturing prototypes separately. We also introduce a State Transition Module (STM) to increase the diversity of training compositions, improving the robustness of the recognition model. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets, including the recent C-QGA dataset, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
