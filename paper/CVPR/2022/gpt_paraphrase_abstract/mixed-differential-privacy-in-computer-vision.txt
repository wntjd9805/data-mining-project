AdaMix is a novel algorithm designed to train deep neural network classifiers using a combination of private and public image data while ensuring differential privacy. While pre-training language models on public datasets has proven effective in maintaining privacy with minimal accuracy loss, this approach does not work as well for vision tasks. In fact, a baseline method that ignores private data can outperform fine-tuning on a large private dataset. To address this trade-off, AdaMix incorporates few-shot training or cross-modal zero-shot learning on public data before fine-tuning with private data. This approach significantly reduces the error increase compared to the non-private upper bound, achieving a range of 68-92% depending on the desired privacy level. AdaMix effectively tackles the challenge of visual classification by balancing privacy sensitivity and classification accuracy. Furthermore, AdaMix offers strong theoretical privacy guarantees and convergence analysis.
