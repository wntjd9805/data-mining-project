We introduce a new approach called Neural Kernel Fields for reconstructing implicit 3D shapes. By leveraging kernel ridge regression, our method achieves impressive results in reconstructing 3D objects and large scenes from sparse oriented points. Moreover, it can accurately reconstruct shape categories that were not present in the training set. Our approach capitalizes on the effectiveness of kernel methods in shape reconstruction when the chosen kernel possesses the appropriate inductive bias. To tackle the problem, we divide it into two components: (1) a backbone neural network that learns kernel parameters from data, and (2) a kernel ridge regression that fits the input points in real-time by solving a simple positive definite linear system using the learned kernel. This factorization enables our reconstruction to benefit from data-driven methods while maintaining interpolatory behavior, meaning that it converges to the true shape as the density of the input sampling increases. Our experiments showcase the strong generalization capability of our approach to objects and scenes that are outside the training set.
