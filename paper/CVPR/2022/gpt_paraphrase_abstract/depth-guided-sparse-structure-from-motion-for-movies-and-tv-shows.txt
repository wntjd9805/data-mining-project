Current methods for Structure from Motion (SfM) are effective in producing 3D reconstructions using images with large parallax. However, in the context of creating engaging video content for movies and TV shows, the camera movement during filming is often limited, resulting in small-motion parallax between frames. This makes traditional geometry-based SfM approaches less effective. To overcome this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach that utilizes a pretrained network to obtain depth information from a single frame, which significantly improves geometry-based SfM for our small-parallax setting. We reconstruct the point cloud and camera pose using depth estimates from detected key points in the initial two-view reconstruction. We then use depth-regularized optimization to register new images and triangulate new points during incremental reconstruction. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new dataset called StudioSfM, which consists of 130 shots and 21K frames from 15 studio-produced videos that have been manually annotated by a professional CG studio. Our approach demonstrates that it (a) greatly enhances the quality of 3D reconstruction for small-parallax scenarios, (b) does not degrade performance for data with large parallax, and (c) maintains the generalizability and scalability of geometry-based sparse SfM.
