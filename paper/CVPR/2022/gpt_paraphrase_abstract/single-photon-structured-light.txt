We introduce a new method for 3D scanning using Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays, which allows for high-frame rates and low-light conditions. This method, known as "Single-Photon Structured Light," works by detecting binary images that indicate the presence or absence of photon arrivals during each exposure. To achieve this, we combine the SPAD array with a high-speed binary projector, both operating at speeds up to 20 kHz. However, the binary images obtained are prone to corruption from photon noise and ambient light sources. To overcome this challenge, we develop innovative temporal sequences using error correction codes that are resilient to short-range effects such as projector and camera defocus, as well as resolution differences between the two devices. Our laboratory prototype successfully performs 3D imaging in difficult scenarios involving objects with low reflectivity or fast motion, as well as scenes with intense ambient lighting.
