We propose a theoretical framework that extends simple and fast algorithms for hierarchical agglomerative clustering to weighted graphs with attractive and repulsive interactions between nodes. This framework introduces GASP, a Generalized Algorithm for Signed graph Partitioning, which allows for the exploration of different combinations of linkage criteria and cannot-link constraints. We demonstrate the equivalence of existing clustering methods to certain combinations and introduce new algorithms for unexplored combinations. Theoretical and empirical analyses of these combinations reveal that some define an ultra-metric on the graph. Through a comprehensive comparison of various instances of GASP on synthetic and existing signed clustering problems, we evaluate accuracy, efficiency, and noise robustness. Additionally, we illustrate that combining certain algorithms from our framework with predictions from a CNN model enables a simple bottom-up instance segmentation pipeline. This pipeline achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the CREMI 2016 EM segmentation benchmark without relying on domain-specific superpixels.
