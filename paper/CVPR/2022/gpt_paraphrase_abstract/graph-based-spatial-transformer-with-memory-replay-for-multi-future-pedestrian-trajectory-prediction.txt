Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a challenging task with various real-life applications like autonomous driving and robotic motion planning. Recent work on trajectory prediction has focused on generating multiple plausible future paths instead of just one. However, existing methods tend to prioritize spatial interactions between pedestrians and their surroundings while neglecting the smoothness and temporal consistency of predictions. Our model addresses this issue by utilizing multi-scale graph-based spatial transformers and a trajectory smoothing algorithm called "Memory Replay" with a memory graph. This approach allows us to effectively incorporate spatial information and correct temporally inconsistent trajectories, such as sharp turns. We also introduce a new evaluation metric called the "Percentage of Trajectory Usage" to assess the comprehensiveness of diverse multi-future predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-future prediction and competitive results in single-future prediction.
