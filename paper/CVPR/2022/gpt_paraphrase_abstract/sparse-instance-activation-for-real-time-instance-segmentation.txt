This paper introduces a unique and efficient framework for real-time instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods that rely on object detection and mask prediction, our approach uses a sparse set of instance activation maps to identify informative regions for each foreground object. These maps are used to aggregate features for recognition and segmentation. By employing bipartite matching, our framework can predict objects in a one-to-one manner, eliminating the need for non-maximum suppression in post-processing. The use of instance activation maps allows for fast inference speed, and our framework achieves impressive results on the COCO benchmark, outperforming other methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. The code and models for our framework are available at https://github.com/hustvl/SparseInst.
