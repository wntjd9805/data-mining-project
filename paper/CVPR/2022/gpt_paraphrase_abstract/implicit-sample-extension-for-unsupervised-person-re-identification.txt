Most existing unsupervised methods for person re-identification (Re-ID) use clustering to create pseudo labels for model training. However, clustering can sometimes result in mixing different true identities or splitting the same identity into multiple sub clusters. This leads to decreased accuracy in Re-ID. We propose a method called Implicit Sample Extension (ISE) to uncover underlying information and generate support samples around cluster boundaries. These support samples are generated using a progressive linear interpolation strategy, considering the direction from the actual sample to its K-nearest clusters and the degree of mixing context information from these clusters. Additionally, ISE utilizes a label-preserving loss to pull the support samples towards their corresponding actual samples, effectively compacting each cluster. By reducing the errors in clustering, ISE improves the performance of unsupervised person Re-ID. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at: https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleClas.
