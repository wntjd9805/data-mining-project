Rotation equivariance is a highly desired property in the field of 3D deep learning. However, existing methods mainly focus on equivariance with respect to global input rotation, overlooking the fact that rotation symmetry has its own spatial support. In the context of object detection in 3D scenes, it is important for an object bounding box to be equivariant with respect to the object pose, regardless of the scene motion. This introduces a new desired property called object-level rotation equivariance. To achieve this, we need a mechanism that can extract equivariant features with local object-level spatial support, while also capturing cross-object context information. In this study, we propose the Equivariant Object detection Network (EON), which incorporates a rotation equivariance suspension design to achieve object-level equivariance. EON can be applied to modern point cloud object detectors, such as VoteNet and PointR-CNN, allowing them to leverage object rotation symmetry in scene-scale inputs. Our experiments on indoor scene and autonomous driving datasets demonstrate significant improvements when incorporating our EON design into state-of-the-art 3D object detectors.
