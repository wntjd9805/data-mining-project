The conventional method for night video surveillance involves using near-infrared (NIR) LEDs, typically at 850nm or 940nm, to illuminate the scene. This saves power and prevents detection by human eyes. However, the resulting images lack color and texture, making it difficult for humans and machines to interpret them. Previous attempts to convert NIR images to RGB using deep learning have been unsatisfactory and lack generalizability. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by investigating how single-chip silicon-based RGB cameras function under NIR illumination and proposing a deep learning approach to optimize LED multiplexing. Experimental results demonstrate that multiplexing NIR LEDs close to the visible spectral range improves the translation from NIR to RGB compared to using 850nm and 940nm LEDs.
