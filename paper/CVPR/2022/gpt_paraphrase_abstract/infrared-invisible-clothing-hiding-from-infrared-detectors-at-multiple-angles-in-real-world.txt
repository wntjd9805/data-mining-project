In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the safety research of thermal infrared imaging, which is commonly used for body temperature measurement and security monitoring. Our study introduces the concept of infrared adversarial clothing, which has the ability to deceive infrared pedestrian detectors from multiple angles. To achieve this, we developed a digital simulation that involved the transformation of cloth into clothing, and then designed an adversarial "QR code" pattern. The key aspect of our method is creating a basic pattern that can be expanded periodically, while ensuring that the pattern remains adversarial even after random cropping and deformation. This allows us to apply the adversarial pattern onto flat cloth to create 3D clothes. Our results demonstrate that the optimized "QR code" pattern significantly reduces the Average Precision (AP) of YOLOv3 (a popular object detection model) by 87.7% in the digital world. Similarly, the random "QR code" pattern and blank pattern lower the AP of YOLOv3 by 57.9% and 30.1%, respectively. Additionally, we produced an adversarial shirt using a new material called aerogel and conducted physical-world experiments. These experiments showed that the adversarial "QR code" pattern clothing reduced the AP of YOLOv3 by 64.6%, while the random "QR code" pattern clothing and fully heat-insulated clothing lowered the AP by 28.3% and 22.8%, respectively. To enhance the transferability of the attack to unseen models, we employed the model ensemble technique.
