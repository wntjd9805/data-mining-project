This study introduces SkinningNet, a Two-Stream Graph Neural Network architecture that can compute skinning weights for a given input mesh and its associated skeleton. Unlike previous methods that rely on pre-computed features or assume a fixed skeleton topology, SkinningNet learns the relationship between mesh vertices and skeleton joints in an end-to-end manner. The proposed method makes use of Multi-Aggregator Graph Convolution, which combines the results of different aggregators to summarize the information passed between vertices and joints. This allows the model to generalize well for unseen topologies. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SkinningNet, as it outperforms current state-of-the-art alternatives.
