We present a new approach called Human-centered 4D Scene Capture (HSC4D) for creating a dynamic digital world that includes large-scale indoor-outdoor scenes, diverse human motions, and realistic interactions between humans and their environments. HSC4D utilizes body-mounted IMUs and LiDAR sensors to capture data, eliminating the need for external devices or pre-built maps. By combining the strengths of both sensors through joint optimization, HSC4D achieves accurate and efficient long-term capture. Additionally, HSC4D explores the relationships between humans and their environments to enhance the realism of their interactions. To support various applications such as AR, VR, robots, and autonomous driving, we have created a dataset consisting of three large scenes with accurate dynamic human motions and locations. The dataset includes diverse scenarios (climbing gym, multi-story building, slope, etc.) and challenging human activities (exercising, walking up/down stairs, climbing, etc.) to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of HSC4D. The dataset and code are publicly available at lidarhumanmotion.net/hsc4d.
