Long-term tracking is challenging due to discontinuous movement caused by factors like occlusion or going out of view. Current methods for long-term tracking follow two main strategies. The first strategy involves using a local tracker for smooth tracking and a re-detector to locate the target when it is lost. However, a drawback of this strategy is that the local tracker may mistakenly identify a nearby distractor as the target instead of activating the re-detector when the real target is not visible. The second strategy involves tracking the target globally throughout the entire image instead of relying on local tracking based on previous results. However, this global tracking strategy does not effectively utilize the temporal context. In this study, we propose a combination of both strategies by tracking the target globally while still exploiting the temporal context. We achieve this by using an ensemble of local trackers that cover the entire image. One local tracker handles the smooth movement of the target, but if it loses track due to sudden discontinuous movement, another local tracker close to the target takes over seamlessly. The activated local tracker leverages the temporal context for local tracking, while the ensemble of local trackers provides the global view for tracking. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.
