This study focuses on solving challenging inverse problems in multi-dimensional imaging, such as completion, denoising, and compressive sensing. These problems are difficult due to the large amount of data and the inherent ill-posedness. To address these issues, the researchers propose a hierarchical low-rank tensor factorization (HLRTF) approach that learns from observed multi-dimensional images without supervision. The HLRTF incorporates a deep neural network (DNN) into the tensor singular value decomposition framework to capture the underlying low-rank structures of the images with compact representation abilities. The DNN acts as a nonlinear transform to improve the low-rank representation. The HLRTF infers the DNN parameters and the underlying low-rank structure of the original data through gradient descent and a non-reference loss function. To handle extreme scenarios like structural missing pixels, the researchers introduce a parametric total variation regularization to constrain the DNN and tensor factor parameters, supported by theoretical analysis. The HLRTF is applied to various inverse problems in multi-dimensional imaging, including completion, denoising, and snapshot spectral imaging, demonstrating its generality and wide applicability. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
