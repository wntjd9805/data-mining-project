The use of deep implicit shape models is widespread in computer vision but has not been widely adopted in biomedical applications. This is due to the lack of large training databases and the presence of noisy biomedical annotations. We present a solution to these challenges by incorporating templates into the deep learning pipeline. Our framework, called ImplicitAtlas, represents a shape as a deformation field from a learned template field. Multiple templates can be integrated to enhance the capacity of shape representation without significant computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on three medical shape datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of ImplicitAtlas over existing implicit representation methods.
