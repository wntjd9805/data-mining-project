This paper proposes a method for learning part segmentation through unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from synthetic data. The authors introduce a comprehensive part segmentation dataset called UDA-Part, which includes labeled parts on 3DCAD models and annotated synthetic images. They also annotate parts on real images to provide a real test set. To improve the adaptation of part models trained on synthetic data to real images, a new UDA algorithm is introduced that utilizes the object's spatial structure. Experimental results on two real test datasets demonstrate the superiority of this approach compared to existing works and show the potential of learning part segmentation from synthetic data for general objects. The authors believe that their dataset can serve as a valuable testbed for studying UDA in part segmentation and will contribute to advancing research in this field.
