Dropout is commonly used in high-level vision tasks to address overfitting, but it is rarely used in low-level vision tasks such as image super-resolution (SR). However, this paper demonstrates that using dropout appropriately can actually benefit SR networks and enhance their generalization ability. The authors find that embedding dropout at the end of the network is more effective, particularly in multi-degradation settings. This unexpected discovery prompts further investigation into the underlying mechanism of dropout in SR. To gain insights, the authors employ two analysis tools - one from a recent network interpretation work and another specifically designed for this task. The results of the analysis support the experimental findings and offer a new perspective for understanding SR networks.
