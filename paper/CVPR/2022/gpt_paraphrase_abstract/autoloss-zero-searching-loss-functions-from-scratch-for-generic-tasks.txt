The automatic design of loss functions for different tasks in deep networks has not been extensively explored. Current approaches rely on handcrafted loss functions, which are limited in their applicability. Searching for loss functions is challenging due to the large search space. Existing methods use task-specific heuristics, making them difficult to generalize to other tasks without significant human effort. To address this, we propose AutoLoss-Zero, a framework for searching loss functions from scratch for various tasks. We create a simple search space using basic mathematical operators to accommodate different tasks and evaluation metrics. We employ a variant of the evolutionary algorithm to discover loss functions in this search space. Additionally, we develop a loss-rejection protocol and a gradient-equivalence-check strategy to enhance search efficiency, applicable to any task. Extensive experiments on computer vision tasks demonstrate that our searched loss functions perform as well as or better than existing ones. They also generalize well to different datasets and networks. We will release the code for our framework.
