In recent years, there has been significant progress in the field of single image dehazing due to the use of deep neural networks and diverse datasets. However, existing methods are limited in their ability to handle different types of hazy images using a dehazing model trained on a specific dataset. To address this issue, one approach is to train on multiple datasets together, but this often compromises the model's performance on individual datasets. Based on this observation, we propose a test-time training method that utilizes a helper network to assist the dehazing model in adapting better to a specific domain. During the test phase, the helper network assesses the quality of the dehazing results and guides the dehazing network to improve its parameters through self-supervision. However, simply including the helper network does not guarantee performance improvement. To address this, we employ a meta-learning approach to align the objectives of the dehazing and helper networks.Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
