We introduce a regularization technique for few-shot novel view synthesis using neural implicit representation. Our approach addresses the problem of reconstruction inconsistency caused by limited viewpoints by imposing an entropy constraint on the density in each ray. To prevent degeneracy when training images are acquired from similar viewpoints, we incorporate a spatial smoothness constraint by limiting information gains from slightly different viewpoints. Our algorithm aims to create compact and consistent reconstructed scenes along individual rays and in the surrounding neighborhood. These regularizers can be easily integrated into existing neural volume rendering techniques based on NeRF. Despite its simplicity, our method consistently outperforms other neural view synthesis methods by a large margin on various standard benchmarks.
