This study focuses on the learning dynamics of deep segmentation networks trained on data with inaccurate annotations. The researchers observe that the networks initially learn from clean pixel-level labels before memorizing the false annotations, a phenomenon previously observed in classification tasks. However, unlike classification, the memorization in segmentation occurs at different times for different semantic categories. Based on these findings, the researchers propose a new method for segmentation from noisy annotations. The method includes two main components. Firstly, the researchers detect the start of the memorization phase for each category individually, allowing for adaptive correction of the noisy annotations to utilize early learning. Secondly, a regularization term is incorporated to enforce consistency across scales and enhance robustness against annotation noise. The proposed method outperforms standard approaches in a medical imaging segmentation task with synthesized annotation errors and achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012, demonstrating robustness to realistic noisy annotations in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.
