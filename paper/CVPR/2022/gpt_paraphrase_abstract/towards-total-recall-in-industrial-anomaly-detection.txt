Detecting defective parts is crucial in large-scale industrial manufacturing. This study addresses the cold-start problem of building a model using only non-defective example images. While manual solutions for each class exist, the aim is to develop systems that can automatically handle multiple tasks effectively. The most successful methods combine ImageNet model embeddings with outlier detection models. This paper introduces PatchCore, which utilizes a highly representative memory bank of nominal patch-features. PatchCore achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and localization, while maintaining competitive inference times. On the widely used MVTecAD benchmark, PatchCore achieves an impressive image-level anomaly detection AUROC score of up to 99.6%, significantly outperforming its closest competitor. Competitive results are also achieved on two other datasets, even in scenarios with limited sample availability.
