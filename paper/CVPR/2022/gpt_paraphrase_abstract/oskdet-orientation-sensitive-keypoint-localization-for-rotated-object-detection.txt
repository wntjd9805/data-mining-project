Rotated object detection is a challenging problem in the field of computer vision. The lack of an effective representation and the confusion caused by parametric regression have hindered the performance of rotated detection. In this study, we propose a novel rotated detector called OSKDet, which is based on orientation-sensitive keypoints. Our approach utilizes a set of keypoints to represent the target object and predicts the keypoint heatmap on the region of interest (ROI) to obtain the rotated bounding box. By introducing an orientation-sensitive heatmap, OSKDet can implicitly learn the shape and direction of the rotated target, enhancing its modeling capabilities for rotated representation. This leads to improved localization accuracy and high-quality detection results. Additionally, we introduce a new unordered keypoint representation paradigm to avoid the confusion caused by rule-based ordering in keypoint regression. Furthermore, we propose a localization quality uncertainty module, which leverages the distribution uncertainty of the keypoints heatmap to better predict the classification score. We evaluate the performance of OSKDet on several public benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we achieve an average precision (AP) of 80.91% on DOTA, 89.98% on HRSC2016, 97.27% on UCAS-AOD, and a F-measure of 92.18% on ICDAR2015 and 81.43% on ICDAR2017, respectively.
