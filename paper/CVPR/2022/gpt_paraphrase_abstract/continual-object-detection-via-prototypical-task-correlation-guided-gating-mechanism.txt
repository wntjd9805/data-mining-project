Continual learning is a difficult problem in developing advanced AI systems due to the continuous streaming of data. While there has been progress in continual classification, continual object detection is hindered by the varying sizes and numbers of objects in each image. To address this issue, we propose a flexible framework called ROSETTA (pRotOtypical taSk corrElaTion guided gaTing mechAnism) for continual object detection. Our approach involves a shared framework for all tasks, with task-aware gates that automatically select sub-models for specific tasks. This allows for the successive memorization of different knowledge by storing corresponding sub-model weights. To determine the availability and usefulness of each experience, we introduce a Gating Diversity Controller (GDC) that adaptively adjusts the diversity of gates based on class-specific prototypes. The GDC module computes a class-to-class correlation matrix to depict cross-task correlation and activates more exclusive gates for new tasks if a significant domain gap is observed. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate that ROSETTA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both task-based and class-based continual object detection.
