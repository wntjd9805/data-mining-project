We examine a common issue in scene-level sketch research, which is the presence of "partial" scene sketches. These sketches do not always include all objects from the corresponding photo due to the subjective interpretation of scenes. Additionally, there are significant empty regions in the sketches resulting from object-level abstraction. As a consequence, existing methods for fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval fail when scene sketches are more partial. To address this problem, we propose a simple set-based approach that utilizes optimal transport (OT) to model region associations in a partially-aware manner. We enhance OT by considering holistic partialness through the comparison of adjacency matrices within the same modality. Our method not only handles partial scene sketches effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing datasets.
