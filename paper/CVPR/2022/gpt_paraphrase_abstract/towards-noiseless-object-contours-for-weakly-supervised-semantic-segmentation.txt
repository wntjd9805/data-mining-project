Weakly supervised semantic segmentation using image-level labels has gained significant attention due to the ease of obtaining these labels. However, existing methods that generate pseudo labels from class activation maps (CAM) often result in incomplete labels as CAM tends to highlight only parts of objects. Some approaches address this issue by training a contour model with CAM seed label supervision and propagating CAM scores from discriminative to non-discriminative regions using contour guidance. However, the propagation process is hindered by noisy intra-object contours, leading to inadequate pseudo labels. To overcome these limitations, we propose training a SANCE model that incorporates an auxiliary segmentation module for contour training. This module supplements high-level semantic information by sharing backbone features and providing more accurate localization maps than CAM for pseudo label generation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.
