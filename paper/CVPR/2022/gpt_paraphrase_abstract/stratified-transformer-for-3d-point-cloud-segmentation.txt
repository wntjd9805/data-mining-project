3D point cloud segmentation has seen significant advancements in recent years, with many methods focusing on local features. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture long-range contexts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Stratified Range Dependencies Transformer, which addresses this limitation and achieves strong generalization ability and high performance.Our approach introduces a unique key sampling strategy. We sample nearby points densely and distant points sparsely as keys for each query point in a stratified manner. This allows the model to effectively expand its receptive field and incorporate long-range contexts without incurring high computational costs. Additionally, we tackle the challenges posed by irregular point arrangements by employing first-layer point embedding to aggregate local information. This technique aids in convergence and enhances overall performance. Furthermore, we utilize contextual relative position encoding to adaptively capture position information.To overcome the issue of varying point numbers in each window, we introduce a memory-efficient implementation. This ensures our method can handle different point densities effectively. We conducted extensive experiments on S3DIS, ScanNetv2, and ShapeNetPart datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Stratified-Transformer.
