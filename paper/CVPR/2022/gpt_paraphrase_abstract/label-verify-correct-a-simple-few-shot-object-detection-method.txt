This paper focuses on few-shot object detection (FSOD), which involves training an object detector for a new category with only a few instances. The authors propose a simple pseudo-labelling method to generate high-quality pseudo-annotations from the training set, significantly increasing the number of training instances and addressing class imbalance. This method also identifies previously unlabeled instances. However, training the model solely on these predictions leads to sub-optimal results. To improve the precision of the pseudo-labelling process, the authors introduce two novel techniques: a verification technique to remove candidate detections with incorrect class labels and a specialized model to correct poor quality bounding boxes. By implementing these steps, the authors obtain a large set of high-quality pseudo-annotations that enable end-to-end training of their final detector. The authors also demonstrate that their method maintains the performance of the base class and highlights the effectiveness of simple augmentations in FSOD. In benchmarking against PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets, the authors' method achieves state-of-the-art or second-best performance compared to existing approaches across all number of shots.
