This study addresses the challenge of temporally interpolating dynamic 3D point clouds with significant non-rigid deformation. The problem is approached by estimating smooth point-wise trajectories and considering the challenges of temporal irregularity and under-sampling. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose IDEA-Net, a deep learning framework that leverages explicitly learned temporal consistency. The framework includes a temporal consistency learning module to align consecutive point cloud frames and enable linear interpolation for coarse trajectories. To account for the non-linear components of trajectories, aligned feature embeddings encoding local geometry properties are used to regress point-wise increments, which are then combined with the coarse estimations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually. The framework has potential applications in 3D motion data acquisition. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/ZENGYIMING-EAMON/IDEA-Net.git.
