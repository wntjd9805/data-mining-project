This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) based solution for unsupervised video anomaly detection (UVAD). Unlike existing UVAD methods that rely on shallow models, our approach utilizes deep reconstruction, which we refer to as "normality advantage," to detect anomalies in unlabeled videos. We introduce a baseline method called Localization based Reconstruction (LBR) that leverages this property for effective UVAD. Additionally, we propose a self-paced refinement (SPR) scheme that gradually eliminates suspicious anomalies from the learning process, further enhancing UVAD performance. We also incorporate motion cues into our solution, resulting in even better UVAD performance compared to classic VAD methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods and is on par with the mainstream performance of classic VAD.
