The abstract discusses the problem of multi-view clustering, which aims to improve clustering performance by using information from multiple views. However, it is observed that learning from more views does not always result in better clustering performance. To address this issue, the authors propose a deep learning framework that reduces the risk of performance degradation when adding more views. The framework simultaneously extracts complementary information and eliminates meaningless noise by automatically selecting features. These two learning procedures are combined into a unified framework using an optimization objective. The authors theoretically prove that the model's clustering risk is not higher than learning from data with fewer views or from the new increased single view. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework in achieving safe multi-view clustering.
