Many recent studies aim to develop lightweight deep networks for video object detection on mobile devices. It has been observed that several existing detectors, which were previously considered computationally expensive for mobiles, inherently support adaptive inference and offer a multi-branch object detection framework (MBODF). The term MBODF refers to a solution with multiple execution branches that can be dynamically selected at inference time to meet different latency requirements, such as by adjusting the input frame resolution. This paper addresses the broad question of exposing the appropriate set of execution branches and scheduling the optimal one at inference time for all MBODFs. Furthermore, it emphasizes the significance of making a content-aware decision regarding which branch to run, as the optimal choice depends on the video content. The study explores a content-aware scheduler, both in an ideal scenario (Oracle) and in a practical scenario, utilizing various lightweight feature extractors. The evaluation demonstrates that our SMARTADAPT, built on the Faster R-CNN-based MBODF, achieves a higher Pareto optimal curve in the accuracy-vs-latency space compared to seven baseline methods when tested on the ILSVRC VID dataset.
