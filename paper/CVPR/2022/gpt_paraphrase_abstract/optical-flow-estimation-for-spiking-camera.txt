The spiking camera is a bio-inspired sensor known for its high temporal resolution and potential in motion estimation for high-speed scenes. However, existing methods are not suitable for analyzing spike streams from the spiking camera due to differences in data modalities. To address this, we propose SCFlow, a deep learning pipeline specifically designed to estimate optical flow from spike streams in high-speed scenes. We introduce a new input representation that can effectively remove motion blur in spike streams based on prior motion information. We also create two synthetic datasets, SPIFT and PHM, to train SCFlow using random high-speed and well-designed scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that SCFlow can accurately predict optical flow from spike streams in various high-speed scenes and shows promising generalization on real spike streams. The codes and datasets for SCFlow are available at https://github.com/Acnext/Optical-Flow-For-Spiking-Camera.
