In recent years, there has been a growing interest in improving the perception performance of LiDARs on autonomous vehicles. While most previous research has focused on developing new deep learning algorithms or model architectures, our study takes a different approach by examining the physical design aspect of LiDAR placement and its impact on learning-based perception. We propose an easily computable information-theoretic surrogate metric to evaluate the placement of multiple LiDARs for 3D object detection. Additionally, we introduce a new framework in the CARLA simulator for data collection, detection model training, and evaluation of different multi-LiDAR configurations. Through extensive experiments using popular placements inspired by self-driving companies, we demonstrate the correlation between our surrogate metric and the object detection performance of various algorithms on the KITTI dataset. This validates the effectiveness of our LiDAR placement evaluation approach. Our findings reveal that sensor placement significantly affects 3D point cloud-based object detection, leading to a performance discrepancy of 5% to 10% in terms of average precision in challenging detection settings. This study represents one of the first quantitative investigations into the influence of LiDAR placement on perception performance.
