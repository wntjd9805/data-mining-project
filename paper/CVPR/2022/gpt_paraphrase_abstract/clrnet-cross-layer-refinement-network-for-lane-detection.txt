We propose a novel approach called Cross Layer Refinement Network (CLRNet) for accurate lane detection in intelligent vehicles. Lanes play a crucial role in the vision navigation system and possess high-level semantics. However, accurately localizing lanes requires detailed low-level features. While the use of different feature levels is important, it remains unexplored in lane detection.CLRNet addresses this issue by utilizing both high-level and low-level features in lane detection. It first detects lanes using high-level semantic features and then refines the detection using low-level features. This approach allows us to leverage contextual information for lane detection while improving localization accuracy with local detailed lane features. To enhance the feature representation of lanes, we introduce ROIGather to gather global context. Additionally, we propose a Line IoU loss, which regresses the lane line as a whole unit to improve localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art lane detection approaches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Turoad/CLRNet.
