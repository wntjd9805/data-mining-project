This paper introduces SIMBAR, a new image-based relighting pipeline that can enhance autonomous driving datasets with a broader range of lighting conditions. Unlike previous methods, SIMBAR leverages explicit geometric representations from a single image. The effectiveness of SIMBAR is demonstrated through qualitative comparisons with existing multi-view scene relighting approaches. Additionally, object detection and tracking experiments using a state-of-the-art method show that leveraging SIMBAR for data augmentation improves the Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) by 9.0% relative to the baseline. The achieved MOTA of 93.3% on the SIMBAR-augmented KITTI dataset surpasses the MOTA of 85.6% on the original KITTI dataset. Both models were trained from scratch and tested on Virtual KITTI.
