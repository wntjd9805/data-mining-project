Lidar sensors are commonly used in autonomous driving and augmented reality but can generate a large amount of data, resulting in high costs for storage and transmission. Previous research has mainly focused on compressing 3D point cloud data, but in this study, we propose a new approach that directly compresses range images. We introduce a data-driven range image compression algorithm called RID-DLE, which utilizes the scanning pattern of lidar. The algorithm employs a deep model that predicts the next pixel value in a raster scanning order based on contextual laser shots from current and past scans. The differences between the predictions and original values are then compressed using entropy encoding. Our method, evaluated on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI, shows significant improvement in compression rate compared to commonly used point cloud and range image compression algorithms, as well as recent deep learning methods.
