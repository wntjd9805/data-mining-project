The increasing interest in 3D motion estimation, including scene flow and point cloud registration, has led to the use of deep neural networks to construct cost volumes for accurate 3D flow estimation. However, these methods face limitations when defining a search window on point clouds due to their irregular data structure. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method that decomposes the problem into two stages. In the first stage, 3D flows are optimized point-wise, while in the second stage, a recurrent network globally regularizes the flows using the point-wise information. Our method outperforms previous approaches in both 3D scene flow estimation and point cloud registration tasks, demonstrating its superiority on irregular point cloud data. The proposed method is evaluated on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets for 3D scene flow estimation, and on ModelNet40 for point cloud registration. The results show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in both tasks. The source code for our method is available at https://github.com/gxd1994/RCP.
