Spherical novel view synthesis (SNVS) involves generating 360-degree views of dynamic novel scenes based on a set of 360-degree input views. Existing methods use multi-sphere image (MSI) representations to render views quickly, but they can only model low-dimensional color values. Attempting to model high-dimensional appearance features in MSI spheres with a large number of spheres (> 64) is not practical. In this study, we propose a new MSI representation called Soft Occlusion MSI (SOMSI) that allows for modeling high-dimensional appearance features while maintaining fast rendering times. Instead of using a large number of MSI levels, we use a smaller set (e.g. 3) of occlusion levels to model appearance features. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes show that SOMSI achieves a good balance between accuracy and run-time. Compared to the MSI-based MODS method, SOMSI produces considerably better results while maintaining similar fast rendering times. Furthermore, SOMSI achieves view synthesis quality comparable to state-of-the-art NeRF-like models but is two orders of magnitude faster.
