The current methods for pose estimation require a large number of annotated images, which is a time-consuming process. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Meta Agent Teaming Active Learning (MATAL) that actively selects and labels informative images for effective learning. MATAL uses a Markov Decision Process to select images and learns a sampling policy that maximizes the pose estimator's performance. Our framework includes a unique state-action representation and a multi-agent team for batch sampling in active learning. We optimize the framework using Meta-Optimization to adapt to expanding labeled data during deployment. We conduct experiments on human hand and body pose estimation datasets and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches within the same annotation budget. Additionally, our MATAL framework reduces labeling efforts by around 40% compared to state-of-the-art active learning frameworks while maintaining similar pose estimation accuracy.
