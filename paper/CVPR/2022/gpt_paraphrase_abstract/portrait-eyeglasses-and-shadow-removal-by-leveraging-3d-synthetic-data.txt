This paper introduces a new framework for removing eyeglasses and their cast shadows from face images. The method follows a detect-then-remove approach, where both the eyeglasses and cast shadows are detected and then removed. To address the lack of paired data for supervised training, a synthetic portrait dataset is created with intermediate and final supervisions for both the detection and removal tasks. Additionally, a cross-domain technique is utilized to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data. This technique is the first of its kind to simultaneously remove eyeglasses and their cast shadows. The code and synthetic dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/StoryMY/take-off-eyeglasses.
