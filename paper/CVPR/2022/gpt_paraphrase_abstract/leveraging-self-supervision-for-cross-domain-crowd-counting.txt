Current methods for counting people in crowded scenes rely on deep networks to estimate crowd density. However, these approaches require a large amount of annotated data to achieve good performance, making them unsuitable for emergency situations where data annotation is costly or time-consuming. One solution is to use synthetic data for training, but this often leads to poor generalization on real images due to domain shift. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that combines synthetic images with unlabeled real images for training. Our network is trained to recognize upside-down real images and predict its own uncertainty, allowing it to generate useful pseudo labels for fine-tuning. This method consistently outperforms existing cross-domain crowd counting algorithms without the need for additional computation during inference. The code for our algorithm is publicly available at the specified GitHub repository.
