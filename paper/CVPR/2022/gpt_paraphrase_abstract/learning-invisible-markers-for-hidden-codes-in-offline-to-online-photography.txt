This paper introduces a new approach to hiding information in publicity materials using invisible codes. Traditional QR codes are not ideal for this purpose as they take up valuable space. Previous methods of invisible codes required markers to locate them, which defeats the purpose of being invisible. Our proposed architecture includes hiding, locating, correcting, and recovery modules, with invisible markers that make the hidden codes truly invisible. Instead of hiding information in the entire image, we hide it in a sub-image and incorporate a localization module for accuracy. To ensure both visual quality and robustness, we propose a multi-stage training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing information hiding methods in both visual quality and robustness. Additionally, the automatic localization of hidden codes reduces the time required for manual correction, which is a significant innovation for information hiding in mobile applications.
