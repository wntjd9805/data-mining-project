Deep learning for graph matching has rapidly developed in the past decade, particularly in computer vision. While recent methods have achieved impressive results in matching graphs of equal size, the problem of matching graphs with varying sizes remains open and challenging. To address this issue, we propose an approach that formulates the graph matching problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem. This formulation allows for flexibility and efficiency in comparing graphs of different sizes. Additionally, we introduce a Graph-context Attention Network (GCAN) that captures both the intrinsic structure of the graph and cross-graph information to enhance the discrimination of node features. The GCAN model is trained to solve the ILP problem with node correspondence supervision. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective in solving the graph-level matching problem and can learn node-to-node similarity through graph-level matching. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets, including those for keypoint matching and blood vessel pattern matching, and our experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms in both keypoint and graph-level matching.
