This study addresses the challenge of 3D face modeling from low-resolution images, where facial geometry and texture are difficult to predict accurately due to the lack of reliable clues. The proposed approach, called Learning to Restore (L2R), aims to reconstruct high-quality 3D faces by extracting generative facial priors and leveraging pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). L2R consists of two main components: an albedo restoration network to model facial texture and a displacement map learning module to enhance facial structure and geometry. These components are optimized together using a 3D-aware adversarial loss, which improves modeling performance and reduces uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that L2R outperforms existing methods when dealing with low-quality inputs and achieves better performance compared to 2D pre-processed modeling approaches with limited 3D information.
