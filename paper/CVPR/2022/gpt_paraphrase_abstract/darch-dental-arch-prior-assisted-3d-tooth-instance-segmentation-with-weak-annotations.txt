This study introduces a low-cost annotation method for 3D tooth instance segmentation on dental models. Instead of annotating each point, only tooth centroids and a few teeth per model are labeled. To address the challenge of weak annotation, a two-stage method called DArch is proposed. The first stage involves tooth centroid detection, which is aided by leveraging a dental arch prior. A coarse-to-fine approach is used to estimate the dental arch, and a graph-based convolutional network refines it. The estimated dental arch is then used in a novel Arch-aware Point Sampling (APS) method to generate tooth centroid proposals. In the second stage, a segmentor is trained using a patch-based strategy to segment tooth instances from 3D patches centered at the tooth centroids. Experimental results on a large dataset demonstrate the accuracy of DArch in segmenting each tooth of a dental model, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
