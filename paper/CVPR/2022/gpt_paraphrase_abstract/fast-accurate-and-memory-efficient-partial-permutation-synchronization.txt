Previous algorithms for multi-object matching, such as partial permutation synchronization (PPS), often require computationally expensive and memory-intensive matrix operations. These operations become impractical for large-scale structure-from-motion datasets. In contrast, the Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP) framework offers a memory-efficient and fast solution for pure permutation synchronization. However, CEMP is limited to compact groups. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improved algorithm called CEMP-Partial, which estimates corruption levels in observed partial permutations. This allows us to implement a nonconvex weighted projected power method without spectral initialization. Our resulting PPS algorithm, MatchFAME (Fast, Accurate and Memory-Efficient Matching), only requires sparse matrix operations, resulting in lower time and space complexities compared to previous PPS algorithms. We prove that, under adversarial corruption and certain assumptions, CEMP-Partial can accurately classify corrupted and clean partial permutations. We demonstrate the superior accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency of our method on both synthetic and real datasets.
