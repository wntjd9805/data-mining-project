This paper addresses the issue of multi-object tracking using the min-cost flow (MCF) formulation, which is commonly studied as a linear program. The success of MCF tracking depends on the learned cost function, but previous studies have only considered two frames during training, resulting in sub-optimal cost functions for multi-frame data association during inference. To overcome this problem, a novel differentiable framework is proposed in this paper. This framework links training and inference together by solving a bi-level optimization problem, where the lower-level solves a linear program and the upper-level includes a loss function that incorporates global tracking results. By back-propagating the loss through differentiable layers via gradient descent, the cost function is explicitly learned and regularized. This approach enables the learning of a better objective for global MCF tracking, leading to competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods on popular multi-object tracking benchmarks such as MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20.
