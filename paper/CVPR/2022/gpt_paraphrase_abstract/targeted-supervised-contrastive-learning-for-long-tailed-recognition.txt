Supervised contrastive learning has been explored as a method to improve performance in long-tailed recognition tasks, where imbalanced data distribution can negatively affect results. However, previous approaches have suffered from poor uniformity in the feature space due to imbalanced data. To address this issue, we propose targeted supervised contrastive learning (TSC), which aims to improve the uniformity of the feature distribution. TSC achieves this by generating uniformly distributed targets on a hypersphere and guiding the features of different classes to converge towards these targets during training. This ensures that all classes, including minority classes, maintain a uniform distribution in the feature space, leading to improved class boundaries and better generalization in the presence of long-tail data. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that TSC achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-tailed recognition tasks.
