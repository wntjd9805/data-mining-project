LAKe-Net is a novel approach to point cloud completion that addresses the issue of missing topology in existing methods. Unlike previous methods that solely predict the location of complete points, LAKe-Net predicts both structured and topological information of the complete shape, resulting in improved performance.The proposed LAKe-Net model completes missing topology through three main steps. Firstly, it employs an asymmetric keypoint locator, consisting of an unsupervised multi-scale keypoint detector and a complete keypoint generator, to localize aligned keypoints from both complete and partial point clouds. The detector is proven to effectively capture aligned keypoints for objects within a sub-category.Secondly, LAKe-Net generates a new type of skeleton called Surface-skeleton from the localized keypoints. This skeleton incorporates geometric priors and fully represents the topological information captured from the keypoints, enhancing the recovery of local details.Lastly, the model includes a refinement sub-net where multi-scale surface-skeletons are inputted into recursive skeleton-assisted refinement modules. This assists in the completion process and further refines the shape.Experimental results demonstrate that LAKe-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud completion. By considering both geometric and topological aspects, the proposed model successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods and provides more accurate and comprehensive completion results.
