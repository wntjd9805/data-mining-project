Camouflaged object detection (COD) is a challenging task that involves identifying objects that are seamlessly blended into their surroundings. Traditional methods rely on mimicking human visual ability in the RGB domain, but in this study, we propose going beyond human biological vision by incorporating the frequency domain as an additional clue. To achieve this, we introduce a powerful network with two components: a novel frequency enhancement module (FEM) and a high-order relation module (HOR). The FEM utilizes the offline discrete cosine transform and learnable enhancement to extract frequency clues of camouflaged objects. We then use feature alignment to combine the features from the RGB and frequency domains. The HOR module further utilizes the rich fusion feature to improve detection accuracy. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on three widely-used COD datasets.
