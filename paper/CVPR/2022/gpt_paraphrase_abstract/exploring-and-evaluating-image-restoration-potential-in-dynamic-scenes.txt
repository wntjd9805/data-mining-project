In dynamic scenes, images often have blurred or noisy quality due to overlapping motions or quick shutter speed. The ability to restore sharp and clean images depends on the restoration methods used and the quality of the input image. While previous research has focused on developing better restoration models, fewer studies have evaluated the impact of different input images on the quality of the restored results. This paper introduces a new concept called "image restoration potential" (IRP) to better understand the value of an image for restoration. A dynamic scene imaging dataset is created to validate the existence of IRP and investigate its properties. A novel deep model is proposed to accurately predict IRP values by distilling and fusing degradation features. The proposed model demonstrates its superiority in IRP prediction. The predicted IRP values are then used to benefit various image restoration applications, such as filtering valuable frames, guiding restoration models, and optimizing camera settings for dynamic scenarios.
