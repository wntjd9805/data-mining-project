Recent studies in semi-supervised learning (SSL) have focused on teacher-student architectures, where the student network is trained using supervisory signals generated by the teacher. However, data augmentation strategies in SSL frameworks have proven to be challenging, particularly in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). Existing strong augmentation methods that involve image geometry and interpolation-regularization can potentially compromise the accuracy of bounding box location in object detection. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation technique called Mix/UnMix (MUM) for SSOD. MUM involves mixing and reconstructing input image tiles in the feature space, allowing us to leverage the interpolation-regularization effect and generate meaningful weak-strong pairs with non-interpolated pseudo-labels. MUM can easily be integrated into different SSOD methods and our experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets show that MUM consistently improves the mean Average Precision (mAP) performance compared to the baseline across various SSOD benchmark protocols.
