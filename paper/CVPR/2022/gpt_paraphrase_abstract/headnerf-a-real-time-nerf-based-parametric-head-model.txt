This paper introduces HeadNeRF, a novel parametric head model that combines the neural radiance field (NeRF) with the parametric representation of the human head. By using the neural radiance field instead of the traditional 3D textured mesh, HeadNeRF is able to generate high fidelity head images. However, the original NeRF's computationally expensive rendering process poses a challenge in constructing the parametric NeRF model. To overcome this issue, the authors integrate 2D neural rendering into the rendering process of NeRF and propose new loss terms. This significantly accelerates the rendering speed of HeadNeRF, reducing the rendering time of one frame from 5 seconds to 25 milliseconds. The designed loss terms also improve rendering accuracy and enable the synthesis of fine-level details such as gaps between teeth, wrinkles, and beards. The effectiveness of HeadNeRF is demonstrated through extensive experiments and various applications. The trained parametric model can be accessed at https://github.com/CrisHY1995/headnerf.
