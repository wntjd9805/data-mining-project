This paper presents a new algorithm for detecting road lanes using eigen-lane space. The algorithm introduces the concept of eigenlanes, which are data-driven descriptors that can represent various types of lanes, including curved and straight lanes. To obtain eigenlanes, a rank-M approximation is performed on a lane matrix that contains all lanes in a training set. The algorithm then generates a set of lane candidates by clustering the training lanes in the eigenlane space. Finally, an optimal set of lanes is determined using an anchor-based detection network called SIIC-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent detection performance for lanes with different structures. The source code for the algorithm is available at https://github.com/dongkwonjin/Eigenlanes.
