We present a new approach for domain adaptive semantic segmentation using self-training. While self-training has been effective in generating pseudo labels for unlabeled target data, it often leads to biased and noisy labels due to imbalanced datasets. Our proposed method, Region Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty (RIPU), utilizes a region-based active learning approach to automatically select a small set of image regions for labeling, maximizing segmentation performance. RIPU incorporates a novel acquisition strategy that considers the spatial adjacency of image regions and their prediction confidence. This region-based selection strategy optimizes the limited labeling budget better than existing image-based or point-based approaches. Additionally, RIPU enforces local prediction consistency between pixels and their nearest neighbors in the source image, and introduces a negative learning loss to enhance feature discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves near-supervised performance with very few annotations and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/RIPU.
