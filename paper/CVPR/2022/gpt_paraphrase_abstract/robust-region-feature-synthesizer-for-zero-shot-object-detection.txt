Zero-shot object detection is a research area that focuses on detecting both seen and unseen classes in an unconstrained test image by incorporating class semantic vectors. This study identifies the main challenges in this field, which involve synthesizing robust region features for unseen objects that are as diverse within the class and separable across classes as real samples. To tackle these challenges, a new framework for zero-shot object detection is proposed. This framework consists of an Intra-class Semantic Diverging component and an Inter-class Structure Preserving component. The former allows for the generation of diverse visual features from each class semantic vector, preventing misclassification of real unseen objects as image backgrounds. The latter ensures that the synthesized features are not too scattered, avoiding confusion between inter-class relationships and the foreground-background relationship. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, COCO, and DIOR datasets. Particularly, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC and COCO, and it is the first study to apply zero-shot object detection in remote sensing imagery.
