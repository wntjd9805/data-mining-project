Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown promise as an alternative to image-based methods, as it is not affected by occlusions and is not limited to the camera's field of view. However, capturing motion and global position accurately with only a few inertial sensors is challenging and often leads to ambiguous results. Current methods struggle to handle long duration motions and often produce unrealistic artifacts due to the lack of consideration for physical constraints. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines a neural kinematics estimator and a motion optimizer that takes into account physical constraints to track body motions using only 6 inertial sensors. The kinematics module predicts the motion status as a reference, and the physics module refines the motion to ensure it adheres to physical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in capture accuracy, temporal stability, and adherence to physical correctness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
