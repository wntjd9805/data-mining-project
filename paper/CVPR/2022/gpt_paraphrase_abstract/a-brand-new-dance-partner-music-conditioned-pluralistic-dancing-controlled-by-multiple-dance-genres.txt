Choreographers often rely on their familiar dance genres, resulting in repetitive patterns in their movements. This limitation can be overcome with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). By using AI, choreographers can blend different dance genres and find new ways to match their choreographic style. Many autoregressive networks have been developed for dance generation, but they have the drawback of returning repeated patterns. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called MNET. This approach uses a single model to synthesize pluralistic dance generation by leveraging a conditional generative adversarial network with a Transformer architecture. Through extensive experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method, compared to existing methods, generates diverse and high-quality dance sequences across multiple genres.
