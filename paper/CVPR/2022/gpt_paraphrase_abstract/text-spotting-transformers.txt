This paper introduces TESTR, a text spotting framework that utilizes Transformers for detecting and recognizing text in various environments. TESTR utilizes a single encoder and dual decoders to perform joint text-box control point regression and character recognition. Unlike existing methods, TESTR does not rely on Region-of-Interest operations or heuristics-driven post-processing procedures. It is particularly effective in handling curved text-boxes, which require special attention for adapting traditional bounding-box representations. The paper presents a canonical representation of control points suitable for text instances in both Bezier curve and polygon annotations. Additionally, a bounding-box guided polygon detection process (box-to-polygon) is designed. Experimental results on curved and arbitrarily shaped datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed TESTR algorithm.
