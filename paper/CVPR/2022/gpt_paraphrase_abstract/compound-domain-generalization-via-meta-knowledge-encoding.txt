This study focuses on the problem of domain generalization (DG), which aims to improve the ability of a model to generalize to unseen target domains by leveraging knowledge from multiple seen source domains. Traditional DG methods assume that the domain label of each source sample is known in advance, which is often not feasible in real-world applications. Therefore, this paper explores the practical problem of compound DG, where the discrete domain assumption is relaxed to a mixed source domains setting.Existing DG algorithms primarily focus on achieving semantic invariance across domains (one-vs-one), while paying less attention to the holistic semantic structure (many-vs-many). However, this holistic semantic structure, referred to as meta-knowledge, is essential for learning representations that can be generalized to out-of-distribution domains. To address this, the authors propose a general approach called COmpound domain generalization via Meta-knowledge ENcoding (COMEN).COMEN consists of two steps. Firstly, the authors introduce Style-induced Domain-specific Normalization (SDNorm) to re-normalize the underlying distributions of the multi-modal data, effectively dividing the mixture of source domains into latent clusters. This step helps in automatically discovering and modeling the latent domains. Secondly, COMEN utilizes prototype representations, which are the centroids of classes, to perform relational modeling in the embedding space. This is done using two parallel and complementary modules that explicitly encode the semantic structure for generalization to out-of-distribution domains.Experimental results on four standard DG benchmarks demonstrate that COMEN outperforms existing approaches without requiring domain supervision. This means that COMEN can effectively discover and model latent domains, and utilize the holistic semantic structure to improve the generalization performance of models in unseen target domains. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach for compound DG that addresses the limitations of existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in DG tasks.
