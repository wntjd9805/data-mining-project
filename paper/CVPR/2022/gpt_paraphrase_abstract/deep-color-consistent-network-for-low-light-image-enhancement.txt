Existing methods for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) focus on improving the illumination but neglect the importance of maintaining color consistency. This often results in a noticeable difference in color between the enhanced image and the original. To address this issue, we propose a new deep learning network called DCC-Net that aims to retain color consistency in LLIE. Our approach employs a collaborative strategy called "divide and conquer" which separates the color image into two components: a gray image for generating structures and textures, and a color histogram for preserving color consistency. By utilizing both components, our network enhances both illumination and color simultaneously. Additionally, we introduce a new pyramid color embedding module (PCE) to better incorporate color information into the LLIE process. Experimental results on six real datasets demonstrate that our DCC-Net produces enhanced images that are more natural and colorful compared to state-of-the-art methods.
