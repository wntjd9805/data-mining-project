Multi-view clustering methods have gained popularity for their ability to combine different perspectives without manual annotations. However, these methods often assume that each instance is present in all views. In reality, some views may have missing instances, leading to incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Existing IMVC methods suffer from high complexity and time expenditure, making them impractical for large-scale tasks. This paper proposes a flexible and highly-efficient approach to address these challenges. The approach is based on a bipartite graph framework that incorporates multi-view anchor learning and incomplete bipartite graph representation. This unified framework boosts cluster performance and offers linear complexity, making it suitable for large-scale IMVC tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to other IMVC methods. The code for the algorithm is available at 1.
