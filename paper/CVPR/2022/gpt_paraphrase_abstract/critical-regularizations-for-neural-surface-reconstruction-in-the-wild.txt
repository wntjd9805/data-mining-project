RegSDF is a novel method for surface reconstruction that addresses the issues of time complexity and poor robustness in existing neural implicit function approaches. By incorporating point cloud supervisions and geometry regularizations, RegSDF achieves high-quality and robust reconstruction results. It takes an oriented point cloud as input and utilizes a differentiable rendering framework to optimize a signed distance field and a surface light field. Two critical regularizations are introduced: Hessian regularization, which smooths the signed distance values for noisy and incomplete input, and minimal surface regularization, which interpolates and extrapolates missing geometry. Experimental evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that RegSDF outperforms recent neural surface reconstruction methods by reconstructing surfaces with fine details, even in open scenes with complex topologies and unstructured camera trajectories.
