Most existing 3D point cloud analysis models have focused on developing new network architectures or more efficient modules for aggregating point features. However, regardless of the approach used, these models commonly rely on max-pooling to obtain permutation-invariant features. This traditional method only considers a fraction of the 3D points, discarding the rest. To address this limitation and enhance the performance of baseline models for point classification or segmentation, we propose a new module called the Recycling Max-Pooling (RMP) module. This module recycles and utilizes the features of the discarded points, incorporating a refinement loss to improve prediction accuracy. Our work is the first to explore recycling useful points that are traditionally discarded by max-pooling. We validate the effectiveness of the RMP module by integrating it into various baseline and state-of-the-art networks for point cloud classification and indoor semantic segmentation tasks. We consistently observe performance improvements across all tested networks, without making any additional modifications to the base network implementation or hyperparameters.
