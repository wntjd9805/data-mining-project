Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS) aims to segment and identify all object instances consistently across all frames by assigning a class label to each pixel. Traditional solutions break down the VPS task into sub-tasks and use multiple surrogates to represent objects. However, this approach requires complex post-processing and is prone to failures. In this paper, we propose Slot-VPS, the first end-to-end framework for VPS. We introduce panoptic slots, a unified representation that encodes all panoptic entities in a video, including foreground instances and background semantics. Our Video Panoptic Retriever retrieves and encodes spatio-temporal object information into the panoptic slots, enabling the localization, segmentation, differentiation, and association of objects in a unified manner. The output panoptic slots can be directly converted into the class, mask, and object ID of panoptic objects in the video. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive ablation studies on the Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art performance with VPQ scores of 63.7, 63.3, and 56.2, respectively.
