We propose Continuous Scene Representations (CSR), a scene representation created by an embodied agent navigating within a space. In CSR, objects and their relationships are modeled using continuous valued embeddings. Our method captures the relationships between objects and constructs a graph structure in real-time, while also placing the agent within the representation. Our main innovation is embedding pairwise object relationships in a latent space, which allows for a more comprehensive representation compared to discrete relations commonly used in scene building. CSR can track objects as the agent moves in a scene, update the representation accordingly, and detect changes in room configurations. Using CSR, we achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods in the challenging task of visual room rearrangement, without requiring specific training for the task. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned embeddings capture important spatial details of the scene and are applicable to real-world data.
