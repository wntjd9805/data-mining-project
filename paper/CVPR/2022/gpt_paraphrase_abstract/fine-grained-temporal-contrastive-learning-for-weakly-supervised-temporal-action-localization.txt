In the task of weakly-supervised action localization (WSAL), where only video-level action labels are provided during model training, existing methods primarily use a classification-based approach and ignore the fine-grained temporal differences between video sequences. This leads to challenges in classification learning and adapting classification to localization. This paper proposes that learning through contextually comparing sequence-to-sequence differences is crucial in WSAL and aids in identifying coherent action instances. The paper introduces two contrastive objectives, namely Fine-grained Sequence Distance (FSD) contrasting and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) contrasting, formulated under differentiable dynamic programming. FSD contrasting considers the relationships between action and background proposals using match, insert, and delete operators, while LCS contrasting discovers the longest common subsequences between two videos. Both contrastive modules complement each other and effectively bridge the gap between action-background separation and the classification-localization tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.
