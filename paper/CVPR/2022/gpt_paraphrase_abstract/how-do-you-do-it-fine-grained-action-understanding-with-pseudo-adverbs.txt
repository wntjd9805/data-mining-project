In this study, our objective is to comprehend the execution of actions and differentiate subtle variances, such as the distinction between 'fold firmly' and 'fold gently'. Our proposed method aims to identify adverbs across various actions; however, obtaining precise annotations for these nuances is challenging due to their limited availability and the difficulty in recognizing adverbs in uncommon combinations of actions and adverbs. To overcome these challenges, we employ a semi-supervised learning approach that utilizes multiple adverb pseudo-labels in conjunction with videos labeled only with action annotations. By applying adaptive thresholding to these pseudo-adverbs, we effectively utilize the available data while addressing the long-tailed distribution issue. Furthermore, we collect adverb annotations for three existing video retrieval datasets, enabling us to introduce the novel tasks of recognizing adverbs in unseen combinations of actions and adverbs, as well as in unseen domains. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method, surpassing previous approaches in adverb recognition and outperforming semi-supervised methods adapted for adverb recognition. We also illustrate how adverbs can establish connections between fine-grained actions.
