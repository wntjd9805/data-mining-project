Data imbalance is a common issue in real-world visual regressions, such as age estimation and pose estimation, which negatively impacts the model's ability to generalize and be fair. As a result, there has been a growing interest in addressing imbalanced regression. Unlike imbalanced classification, imbalanced regression deals with continuous labels that can be boundless and high-dimensional, making it more challenging.  This study examines the widely used Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function and finds that it is ineffective in imbalanced regression. From a statistical perspective, the researchers propose a new loss function called Balanced MSE to better handle imbalanced training label distributions. They also develop various implementations of Balanced MSE to address different real-world scenarios, including situations where prior knowledge about the training label distribution is not available.  Notably, Balanced MSE is the first general solution for high-dimensional imbalanced regression in the modern context, as far as the researchers know. The effectiveness of Balanced MSE is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on synthetic data and three real-world benchmarks. The researchers have made the code and models for Balanced MSE available on GitHub.  Overall, this research highlights the importance of addressing data imbalance in visual regressions and introduces a novel loss function, Balanced MSE, as a solution. The results of the experiments indicate that Balanced MSE is effective in improving the performance of imbalanced regression models.
