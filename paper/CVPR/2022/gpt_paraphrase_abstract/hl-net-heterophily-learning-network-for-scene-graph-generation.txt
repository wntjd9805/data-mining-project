Current scene graph generation methods utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to detect objects and predict their relationships within an image. However, these methods only consider scene graph homophily and ignore heterophily. In this paper, we propose a novel Heterophily Learning Network (HL-Net) that comprehensively explores both homophily and heterophily in scene graphs. HL-Net consists of an adaptive reweighting transformer module that integrates information from different layers to exploit both homophily and heterophily in objects, a relationship feature propagation module that efficiently explores connections between relationships by considering heterophily to refine the relationship representation, and a heterophily-aware message-passing scheme that distinguishes heterophily and homophily between objects/relationships for improved message passing in graphs. We conducted extensive experiments on the Visual Genome (VG) and Open Images (OI) datasets, and the results demonstrate that HL-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, HL-Net achieves a 2.1% higher performance on the VG dataset for scene graph classification and a 1.2% higher performance on the OI dataset for the final score.
