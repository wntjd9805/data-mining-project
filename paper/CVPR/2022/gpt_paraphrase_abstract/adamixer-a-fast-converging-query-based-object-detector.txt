Traditional object detectors use a dense scanning approach to detect objects in images. However, recent query-based object detectors have emerged as an alternative, decoding image features with learnable queries. Despite their potential, these detectors face challenges such as slow convergence, limited performance, and complex network designs. This paper addresses these issues by focusing on the adaptability of decoders in casting queries for different objects. The proposed detector, called AdaMixer, improves adaptability in two ways. Firstly, each query samples features based on estimated offsets, efficiently attending to coherent object regions. Secondly, these sampled features are dynamically decoded using an adaptive MLP-Mixer guided by each query. AdaMixer achieves architectural simplicity by eliminating the need for dense attentional encoders or explicit pyramid networks. Experimental results on the MS COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaMixer, achieving high average precision (AP) scores, particularly in detecting small objects. The proposed architecture provides a simple, accurate, and fast-converging solution for query-based object detection. The code for AdaMixer can be found at the provided GitHub link.
