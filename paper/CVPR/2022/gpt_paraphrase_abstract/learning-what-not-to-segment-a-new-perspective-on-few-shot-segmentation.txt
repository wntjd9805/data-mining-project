Recently, there has been significant development in the field of few-shot segmentation (FSS). However, most previous approaches focus on achieving generalization through the meta-learning framework derived from classification tasks. This leads to trained models that are biased towards the classes they have seen during training, making it difficult to recognize new concepts. This paper presents a novel solution to address this problem.The proposed approach introduces an additional branch, referred to as the base learner, to the conventional FSS model, which is known as the meta learner. The role of the base learner is to explicitly identify the regions in the image that do not need to be segmented, i.e., the targets of the base classes. In parallel, the meta learner generates coarse segmentation results. These two sets of results are then adaptively integrated to produce precise segmentation predictions.To account for the sensitivity of the meta learner, an adjustment factor is introduced to estimate the differences between the scenes depicted in the input image pairs. This factor aids in improving the ensemble forecasting of the model. Experimental results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant performance gains achieved. Surprisingly, even with just two plain learners, our versatile scheme sets a new state-of-the-art.Furthermore, the proposed approach is extended to a more challenging setting known as generalized FSS. In this setting, both base and novel classes are required to be determined. The proposed approach shows promising results in this realistic scenario as well.The source code for the proposed approach is available on GitHub at github.com/chunbolang/BAM.
