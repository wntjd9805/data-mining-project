Recent advancements in 3D vision have been driven by the development of specialized architectures that incorporate geometric inductive biases. This paper aims to address 3D reconstruction using a versatile architecture and explores the incorporation of these inductive biases directly as additional inputs to the model. By adopting this approach, it becomes possible to utilize existing general models, like Perceivers, in this complex domain without requiring architectural modifications. Moreover, this approach maintains the data efficiency of customized models. The focus of this study is on encoding cameras, projective ray incidence, and epipolar geometry as inputs to the model. The results demonstrate competitive performance in multi-view depth estimation across various benchmarks.
