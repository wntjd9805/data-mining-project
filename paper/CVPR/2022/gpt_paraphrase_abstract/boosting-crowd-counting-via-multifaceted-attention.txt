This paper introduces a Multifaceted Attention Network (MAN) to address the challenging task of crowd counting. Current convolutional neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers struggle to handle the large-scale variations present in crowd images. To overcome this limitation, MAN combines global attention from transformer models with learnable local attention and instance attention. The proposed Learnable Region Attention (LRA) assigns attention dynamically to each feature location, while Local Attention Regularization ensures consistent attention across different locations. Additionally, an Instance Attention mechanism focuses on important instances during training. The effectiveness of MAN is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four crowd counting datasets. The results confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, which can be accessed at https://github.com/LoraLinH/Boosting-method.Crowd-Counting-via-Multifaceted-Attention.Code.
