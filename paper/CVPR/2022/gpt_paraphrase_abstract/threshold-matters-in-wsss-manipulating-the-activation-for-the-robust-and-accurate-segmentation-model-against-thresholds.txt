Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has recently received significant attention due to its ability to train segmentation models using only image-level labels. Existing WSSS methods argue that the limited coverage of Class Activation Maps (CAM) is the main performance bottleneck. However, this paper presents analytical and empirical evidence suggesting that the bottleneck may not be the sparse coverage, but rather a global thresholding scheme applied after CAM. The study demonstrates that this issue can be addressed by meeting two conditions: 1) reducing the imbalance in foreground activation and 2) increasing the gap between foreground and background activation. Based on these findings, a novel activation manipulation network is proposed, incorporating a per-pixel classification loss and a label conditioning module. The per-pixel classification induces a two-level activation in activation maps, effectively penalizing the most distinctive parts, promoting the less distinctive parts, and deactivating the background regions. The label conditioning module ensures that the output label of pseudo-masks aligns with true image-level labels, penalizing incorrect activation assigned to non-target classes. Extensive analysis and evaluations demonstrate that each component contributes to generating accurate pseudo-masks, achieving robustness against the choice of the global threshold. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on both the PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. The code for the model is accessible at https://github.com/gaviotas/AMN.
