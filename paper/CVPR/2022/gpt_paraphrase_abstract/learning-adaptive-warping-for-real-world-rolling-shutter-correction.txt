This paper introduces the BS-RSC dataset and a corresponding model for correcting the rolling shutter (RS) effect in distorted videos. CMOS-based sensors used in consumer mobile devices often result in RS effects when there are relative movements during video capture. However, existing RS correction methods struggle to remove RS effects in real scenarios due to the diverse and difficult-to-model motions. To address this issue, the authors propose the BS-RSC dataset, which consists of real distorted videos and corresponding ground truth. These videos are recorded simultaneously using a beam-splitter-based acquisition system and contain various camera and object motions in dynamic scenes. Additionally, an RS correction model with adaptive warping is proposed. This model can adaptively warp the learned RS features into global shutter counterparts using predicted multiple displacement fields. The warped features are then aggregated and reconstructed into high-quality global shutter frames using a coarse-to-fine strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the BS-RSC dataset enhances the model's ability to remove RS effects in real-world scenarios.
