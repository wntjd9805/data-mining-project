Detectors trained with large labeled datasets often experience significant performance degradation in certain scenarios where there is a gap in data distribution. To address this issue of domain shift, conventional approaches typically focus on reducing the differences between the source and target domains through the use of domain classifiers. However, these approaches overlook the challenge of transferring features that can handle both classification and localization tasks in object detection. To tackle this problem, our paper introduces Task-specific Inconsistency Alignment (TIA), which introduces a new alignment mechanism in separate task spaces to enhance the performance of the detector on both subtasks. We incorporate auxiliary predictors for classification and localization branches and utilize their behavioral inconsistencies as domain-specific measures. We then design task-specific losses to align the disagreements between the domains for both subtasks. By individually optimizing these losses, we are able to approximate the discrepancies in each task space, improving performance in a decoupled manner. TIA produces superior results compared to previous state-of-the-art methods across various scenarios. Additionally, we observe that the classification and localization capabilities of the detector are significantly strengthened, providing further evidence of the effectiveness of our TIA method.
