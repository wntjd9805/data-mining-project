A new approach is proposed for creating elimination templates to solve polynomial systems efficiently in various computer vision problems. The method involves constructing an affine parameterization of the templates and using a heuristic greedy optimization strategy to minimize their size. The method is tested on 34 minimal problems in computer vision, and the resulting templates are either the same size or smaller compared to the current state-of-the-art. In some challenging cases, the templates are significantly smaller, ranging from 2.1 to 6.6 times smaller. Additionally, a template that is 20 times smaller is found for the problem of refractive absolute pose estimation with unknown focal length. The experiments conducted on synthetic data demonstrate that the new solvers are both fast and accurate. Furthermore, a fast and accurate solver is presented for the problem of relative pose estimation with unknown common focal length and radial distortion.
