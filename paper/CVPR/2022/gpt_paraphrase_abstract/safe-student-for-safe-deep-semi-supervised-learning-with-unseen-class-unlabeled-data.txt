This paper introduces a deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) method called SAFE-STUDENT, which addresses the problem of unseen-class instances appearing in unlabeled data. While one solution is to remove these instances, this approach is limited by the small number of labeled data and ignores the availability of unlabeled data. To overcome this, SAFE-STUDENT proposes a teacher-student view approach. It introduces a scoring function called energy-discrepancy (ED) to improve the security of instance selection by the teacher model. It also incorporates a novel unseen-class label distribution learning mechanism to mitigate the perturbation caused by unseen-class instances. Additionally, an iterative optimization strategy is proposed to facilitate teacher-student network learning. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that SAFE-STUDENT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its feasibility and robustness in addressing this under-explored problem.
