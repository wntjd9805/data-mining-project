We propose a new method for unsupervised activity segmentation that combines video frame clustering with representation learning and online clustering. Unlike previous approaches that perform these tasks sequentially, our approach simultaneously learns representations and clusters frames. We incorporate temporal information using temporal optimal transport, which includes a regularization term to preserve the temporal order of activities. This allows our method to effectively learn representations for unsupervised activity segmentation. Additionally, while previous methods require storing learned features for the entire dataset before clustering, our approach processes one mini-batch at a time in an online manner. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including our own, we demonstrate that our approach performs as well as or better than previous methods while requiring significantly less memory.
