This study addresses the challenge of reconstructing a 3D human mesh of a single person in crowded scenes. Existing methods struggle in such scenarios due to two main reasons. Firstly, there is a domain gap between the training and testing data. The training data, which consists of accurate 3D labels from motion capture datasets, lacks crowd data. This prevents the network from learning robust image features for a target person in crowded scenes. Secondly, the feature processing techniques used in existing methods spatially average the feature map of a bounding box containing multiple people. This averaging makes it difficult to distinguish the features of a target person from others.To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a new method called 3DCrowdNet. This method explicitly targets crowded scenes and aims to estimate a robust 3D human mesh. Firstly, instead of relying on motion capture datasets with 3D labels, the authors leverage 2D human pose estimation for training. This approach does not suffer from the domain gap and does not require 3D labels. Secondly, the authors introduce a joint-based regressor that can distinguish a target person's features from others. This regressor samples features from the target's joint locations and regresses human model parameters. As a result, 3DCrowdNet learns features that are focused on the target person and effectively excludes irrelevant features from nearby individuals.The authors conduct experiments on various benchmarks to evaluate the performance of 3DCrowdNet. The results show that the proposed method is robust in handling crowded scenes, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The researchers provide the source code for their method.In summary, this study introduces 3DCrowdNet, a novel approach for recovering a 3D human mesh in crowded scenes. The method addresses the challenges of domain gap and indistinguishable features by leveraging 2D pose estimation and a joint-based regressor. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DCrowdNet in handling crowded scenes.
