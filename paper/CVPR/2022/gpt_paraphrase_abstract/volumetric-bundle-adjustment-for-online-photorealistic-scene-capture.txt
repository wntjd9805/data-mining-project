Efficiently capturing photorealistic scenes is a difficult task. Although current online reconstruction systems are efficient, the generated images often lack photorealism. Neural volume rendering approaches can produce high-fidelity images but require lengthy training, making them unsuitable for real-time scene capture applications. This paper introduces a system that can reconstruct photorealistic models of complex scenes efficiently. The system processes images in real-time, providing good quality estimates of scene geometry and appearance at the same rate as video capture. To achieve efficiency, a hierarchical feature volume using VDB grids is proposed, which allows for quick retrieval of scene information while being memory-efficient. Additionally, a new optimization technique is presented to enhance the efficiency of bundle adjustment, enabling the system to converge to the desired camera poses and scene geometry faster. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing systems in terms of efficiency and capture quality. This is the first method known to achieve online photorealistic scene capture. The method is illustrated in Figure 1, which showcases the online scene capture approach using a stream of monocular RGB images. The scene is represented using a neural volumetric dynamicB+Tree (nVDB) that stores spatial features in a hierarchical manner. The tree dynamically adjusts its topology as the camera explores the scene. The camera and volume parameters are optimized in real-time using a novel volumetric bundle adjustment method (VBA), allowing for efficient capture of scene appearance and geometry. An online demo of the method can be found in the supplementary video.
