This study focuses on atlas building and image registration in medical image analysis. These tasks involve warping images into an atlas space to study variations within or between subjects, or warping a probabilistic atlas into image space to assign anatomical labels. Previous methods for atlas building have been computationally expensive and have difficulty aligning fuzzy atlases with individual images due to the lack of clear anatomical structures in the fuzzy atlas. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to predict the atlas and a stationary velocity field (SVF) parameterization for diffeomorphic image registration. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require affine pre-registrations and utilizes pairwise image alignment losses for improved accuracy. The model is evaluated on 3D knee magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the OAI-ZIB dataset and demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art image registration algorithms. It also allows for end-to-end training and fast inference at test time.
