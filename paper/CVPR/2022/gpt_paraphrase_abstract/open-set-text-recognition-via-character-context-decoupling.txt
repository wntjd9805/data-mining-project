The open-set text recognition task is a new challenge that requires the ability to recognize new characters during evaluation. The limited performance of current methods is due to the influence of contextual information on the visual information of individual characters. This bias in contextual information affects the classification performance. To address this problem, we propose a framework called Character-Context Decoupling. This framework separates contextual information from character-visual information by isolating temporal information and linguistic information. Temporal information, which includes character order and word length, is handled by a detached temporal attention module. Linguistic information, such as n-grams and other linguistic statistics, is managed through a decoupled context anchor mechanism. Our method shows promising performance on open-set, zero-shot, and close-set text recognition datasets through various experiments.
