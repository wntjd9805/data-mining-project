We propose an efficient method called action boundary detection (ABD) for unsupervised action segmentation in untrimmed videos. Our method has the advantages of no training stage and low-latency inference. To detect action boundaries, we estimate similarities across smoothed frames, leveraging internal consistency within actions and external discrepancy across actions. We transform the boundary detection task into change point detection based on similarity. Non-maximum suppression is applied to select the smallest points as candidate boundaries, followed by a clustering algorithm to refine the proposals. We also extend ABD to the online setting, enabling real-time action segmentation in long videos. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four challenging datasets and strikes the best balance between accuracy and inference time compared to existing unsupervised approaches.
