Deep Implicit Functions (DIFs) are used to represent 3D geometry by employing continuous signed distance functions learned through deep neural networks. While DIFs have been successfully applied in shape reconstruction and dense point correspondences, they do not inherently preserve the topology of shapes, limiting their applicability in scenarios where topological structures are important, such as anatomical structures in medical images. To address this limitation, we propose a new model called Neural Diffeomorphic Flow (NDF). NDF learns deep implicit shape templates by representing shapes as conditional diffeomorphic deformations of templates, thereby preserving the shape topologies. This diffeomorphic deformation is achieved using an auto-decoder composed of Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) blocks that progressively map shapes to implicit templates. We extensively evaluate NDF on various medical image organ segmentation datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in reconstructing and aligning shapes. NDF consistently achieves state-of-the-art results in organ shape reconstruction and registration in terms of both accuracy and quality. The source code for NDF is publicly available at https://github.com/Siwensun/Neural_Diffeomorphic_Flow--NDF.
