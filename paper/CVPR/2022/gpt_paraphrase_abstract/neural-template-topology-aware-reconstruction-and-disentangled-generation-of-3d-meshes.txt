This paper presents a new framework called DT-Net for reconstructing and generating 3D meshes using Dis-entangled Topology. Unlike previous approaches, DT-Net learns a topology-aware neural template for each input and deforms the template to reconstruct a detailed mesh while preserving the learned topology. The key insight is to separate the complex mesh reconstruction into two tasks: topology formulation and shape deformation. This decoupling allows DT-Net to implicitly learn a disentangled representation for the topology and shape in the latent space. As a result, it enables new disentangled controls that support various shape generation applications, such as remixing the topologies of 3D objects, which were not achievable with previous reconstruction methods. Extensive experimental results show that our method produces high-quality meshes, particularly with diverse topologies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
