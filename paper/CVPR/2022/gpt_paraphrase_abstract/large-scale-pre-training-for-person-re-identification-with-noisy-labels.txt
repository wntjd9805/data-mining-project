This paper addresses the issue of pre-training for person re-identification (Re-ID) using noisy labels. The authors introduce a pre-training framework called PNL, which utilizes a simple online multi-object tracking system on raw videos to generate a noisy-labeled dataset called LUPerson-NL. The PNL framework consists of three learning modules: supervised Re-ID learning, prototype-based contrastive learning, and label-guided contrastive learning. These modules not only cluster similar examples but also rectify noisy labels based on prototype assignment. The authors demonstrate that learning directly from raw videos is a promising approach for pre-training, as it utilizes spatial and temporal correlations as weak supervision. They show that their pre-trained model, when applied to the MGN supervised Re-ID method, improves the mean Average Precision (mAP) by 5.7%, 2.2%, and 2.3% on the CUHK03, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17 datasets, respectively. The performance gain is even more significant under the small-scale or few-shot setting, indicating better transferability of the learned representation.
