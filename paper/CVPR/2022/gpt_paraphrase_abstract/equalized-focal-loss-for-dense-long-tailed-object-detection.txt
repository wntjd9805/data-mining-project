Most long-tailed object detectors are based on a two-stage paradigm, but one-stage detectors are more commonly used in industry due to their simplicity and speed. However, the performance of one-stage detectors in long-tailed scenarios has not been explored. We found that the main obstacle for one-stage detectors is the varying imbalance between positive and negative samples in different categories. The conventional focal loss fails to address this issue. To overcome this problem, we propose the Equalized Focal Loss (EFL) which rebalances the loss contribution for different categories based on their imbalance levels. EFL uses a category-relevant modulating factor that can be adjusted dynamically during training. Experimental results on the LVIS v1 benchmark show that EFL achieves an overall AP of 29.2% and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in rare categories.
