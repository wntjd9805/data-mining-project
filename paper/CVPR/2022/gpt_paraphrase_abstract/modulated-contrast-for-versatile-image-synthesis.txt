Perceiving the similarity between images is a fundamental challenge in visual generation tasks. Current methods use pointwise absolute deviations to measure inter-image distance, resulting in blurred and artifact-ridden generated images. This paper introduces MoNCE, a versatile metric that incorporates image contrast to accurately measure multifaceted inter-image distances. Unlike traditional contrast methods that push negative samples away from the anchor regardless of their similarity, MoNCE dynamically adjusts the pushing force based on the similarity between negative samples and the anchor. This adaptation improves the effectiveness of contrastive learning using informative negative samples. MoNCE employs optimal transport to collaboratively modulate the pushing force of negative samples across multiple patch-level contrastive objectives. Extensive experiments across various image translation tasks demonstrate that MoNCE outperforms existing metrics significantly. The code for MoNCE is available at MoNCE.
