Shadow removal is a difficult task due to its ill-posed nature. Existing deep learning methods focus solely on content matching and lack supervision in shadow generation. In this study, we propose a Bijective Mapping Network (BMNet) that combines the learning processes of shadow removal and shadow generation. By optimizing both procedures simultaneously, BMNet effectively restores the background in shadow regions. Additionally, we introduce a Shadow-Invariant Color Guidance Module (SICGM) that utilizes shadow-invariant color information to reduce color bias effects. Experimental results on ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD benchmarks demonstrate that our network outperforms the state-of-the-art method in de-shadowing performance while using significantly fewer network parameters and floating point operations.
