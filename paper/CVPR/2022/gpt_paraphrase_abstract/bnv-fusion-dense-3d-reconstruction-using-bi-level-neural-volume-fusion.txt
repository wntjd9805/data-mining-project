Dense 3D reconstruction from a sequence of depth images is crucial for various applications in mixed reality and robotics. While Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) Fusion methods have made progress in this field, there is a challenge in balancing robustness to noisy measurements and maintaining level of detail. To address this, we introduce Bi-level Neural Volume Fusion (BNV-Fusion), which incorporates recent advancements in neural implicit representations and neural rendering for dense 3D reconstruction. Our approach proposes a novel bi-level fusion strategy that efficiently integrates new depth maps into a global neural implicit representation while considering reconstruction quality. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on multiple datasets, we demonstrate a significant enhancement compared to existing methods.
