This paper introduces E-CIR, a method for transforming blurry images into sharp videos by representing them as a parametric function of time and intensity. E-CIR utilizes events as an auxiliary input and leverages the temporal event structure to construct the parametric bases. A deep learning model is trained to predict the function coefficients, and a refinement module is introduced to enhance appearance consistency by propagating visual features across consecutive frames. Compared to existing event-enhanced de-blurring approaches, E-CIR produces smoother and more realistic results. The implementation of E-CIR can be found at https://github.com/chensong1995/E-CIR.
