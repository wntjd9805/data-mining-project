Personalized image aesthetics assessment (PIAA) is a difficult task due to its highly subjective nature. People's aesthetic preferences are influenced by various factors, including image characteristics and subject traits. However, existing PIAA databases lack diversity in terms of subject annotations, making it difficult to meet the growing demands of PIAA research. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive study on personalized image aesthetics and developed a new database called Personalized image Aesthetics database with Rich Attributes (PARA). This database consists of 31,220 images annotated by 438 subjects, providing rich annotations including 9 objective attributes related to image characteristics and 4 subjective attributes related to human preferences. Additionally, desensitized subject information, such as personality traits, is also included to support the study of PIAA and user profiling. Through an extensive analysis of the annotation data, we found that the proposed subjective attributes can effectively reflect aesthetic preferences. Moreover, we introduced a conditional PIAA model that utilizes subject information as a conditional prior. Experimental results demonstrate that the conditional PIAA model outperforms the control group, highlighting the interaction between image aesthetics and subject characters in shaping personalized tastes. We believe that the PARA database and its associated analysis will be valuable for future PIAA research. The PARA project page can be accessed at: https://cv-datasets.institutecv.com/#/data-sets.
