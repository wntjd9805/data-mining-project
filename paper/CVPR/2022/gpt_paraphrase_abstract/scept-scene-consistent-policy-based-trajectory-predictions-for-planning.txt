Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous systems operating in environments with uncontrolled agents, such as self-driving vehicles. However, existing prediction methods often fail to ensure scene consistency, resulting in frequent collisions between predicted trajectories of different agents. Additionally, these methods tend to generate individual predictions for each agent, making downstream planning challenging.To address these issues, we propose ScePT, a trajectory prediction model based on policy planning. ScePT generates accurate and scene-consistent trajectory predictions that are suitable for motion planning in autonomous systems. It achieves scene consistency by explicitly enforcing it and learns an agent interaction policy that enables conditional prediction.We conducted experiments on real-world datasets containing pedestrians and autonomous vehicles, and the results demonstrate that ScePT achieves prediction accuracy comparable to the current state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving scene consistency. Furthermore, we illustrate ScePT's compatibility with a downstream contingency planner, showcasing its practical application in real-world scenarios.
