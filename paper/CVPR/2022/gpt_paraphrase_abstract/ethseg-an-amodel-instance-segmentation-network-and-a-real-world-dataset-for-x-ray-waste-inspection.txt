Inspection of packaged waste is a crucial step in waste disposal. Existing methods for waste inspection involve either manual visual checking or the use of RGB image-based inspection algorithms. However, these methods are costly and often require the bag to be opened and waste items to be spread out, leading to the possibility of occluded items being missed. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient waste inspection approach using X-ray images that eliminates the need to open the bag. We introduce a new problem of instance-level waste segmentation in X-ray images for intelligent waste inspection and provide a benchmark dataset consisting of 5,038 X-ray images with high-quality annotations. Existing segmentation methods designed for natural images are not suitable for X-ray waste images due to heavy occlusions and the penetration effect. Therefore, we propose a new instance segmentation method that considers these image characteristics. Our method employs an easy-to-hard disassembling strategy to guide the segmentation of highly overlapped objects using high confidence predictions. Additionally, we incorporate a global structure guidance module to better capture the complex contour information resulting from the penetration effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We have released our dataset at WIXRayNet.
