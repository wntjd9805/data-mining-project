The field of computer vision has long focused on interpreting objects using basic geometric shapes. Superquadrics are particularly useful in representing a wide range of shapes with minimal parameters. However, accurately and reliably recovering superquadrics from 3D data remains a challenge. Existing methods are prone to local optima and are sensitive to noise and outliers, often failing to capture geometric shapes accurately. This paper introduces a probabilistic approach to recover superquadrics from point clouds. The proposed method utilizes a Gaussian-uniform mixture model (GUM) on the parametric surface of a superquadric, explicitly accounting for the generation of outliers and noise. The recovery process is formulated as a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem. An algorithm called Expectation, Maximization, and Switching (EMS) is proposed to solve this problem. EMS predicts outliers from a posterior perspective, optimizes the superquadric parameters using the trust-region reflective algorithm, and avoids local optima by globally searching and switching among parameters that encode similar superquadrics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by its ability to recover multi-superquadrics for complex objects. Compared to existing approaches, our method achieves superior accuracy, efficiency, and robustness when tested on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
