Recently, the average precision (AP) loss has shown promising results in dense object detection. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding how AP loss affects the detector in terms of pairwise ranking. This paper aims to address this gap by revisiting AP loss and identifying the selection of ranking pairs between positive and negative samples as a crucial element. Based on this observation, two strategies are proposed to enhance AP loss. The first strategy introduces a novel Adaptive Pairwise Error (APE) loss that focuses on ranking pairs in both positive and negative samples. Additionally, more accurate ranking pairs are selected by leveraging normalized ranking scores and localization scores with a clustering algorithm. Experimental results on the MS-COCO dataset validate the analysis and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over current classification and ranking loss approaches.
