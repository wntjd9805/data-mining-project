This paper proposes a new approach for multi-view stereo using an iterative dynamic cost volume. Compared to other methods, our cost volume is much lighter and can be processed using 2D convolution based GRU. The output of the GRU at each step can be used to generate a new cost volume, creating an iterative GRU-based optimizer. Additionally, we introduce a cascade and hierarchical refinement architecture that utilizes multi-scale information and speeds up convergence. We employ a lightweight 3D CNN to generate the initial depth map, which is necessary for launching the GRU and ensuring fast convergence. The depth map is then refined using multi-stage GRUs that operate on pyramid feature maps. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy, speed, and memory usage, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on the DTU and Tanks & Temples benchmarks. The code for our method will be made available at https://github.com/bdwsq1996/Effi-MVS.
