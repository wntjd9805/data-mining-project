The Trajectory Prediction (TP) model has been successful in computer vision and robotics. However, its design requires manual work and domain knowledge, making it difficult for common users. Additionally, existing works do not consider Federated Learning (FL) scenarios, which limits the potential of utilizing multi-source datasets. To address these issues, we propose ATPFL, a system that allows users to federate multi-source trajectory datasets and automatically design and train a powerful TP model. ATPFL creates an effective TP search space by analyzing existing works and designs a relation-sequence-aware search strategy to automate the TP model design process. Furthermore, we employ appropriate federated training methods within the FL framework to support both the TP model search and final model training, ensuring efficient search and high-performance models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ATPFL enables users to obtain well-performing TP models, outperforming existing models trained on single-source datasets.
