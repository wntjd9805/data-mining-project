This paper proposes a new approach for local retouching in high-resolution photos using an adaptive blend pyramid network. The network consists of a context-aware local retouching layer (LRL) and an adaptive blend pyramid layer (BPL). The LRL performs retouching on low-resolution images by considering both global context and local texture information. The BPL then expands the low-resolution results to higher resolutions using an adaptive blend module and a refining module. The proposed method outperforms existing methods in two local retouching tasks and achieves real-time inference on 4K images using a single NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU. Additionally, the paper introduces a new dataset for high-definition cloth retouching, called CRHD-3K, to encourage further research in the field.
