This paper introduces a novel technique called FourierPlenOctree (FPO) for efficient neural modeling and real-time rendering of dynamic scenes captured under the free-view video (FVV) setting. The FPO combines the generalized NeRF model, PlenOctree representation, volumetric fusion, and Fourier transform. To accelerate FPO construction, a coarse-to-fine fusion scheme is presented, leveraging the generalized NeRF technique for tree generation. To handle dynamic scenes, the implicit network is tailored to model the Fourier coefficients of time-varying density and color attributes. The FPO is constructed and the Fourier coefficients are trained directly on the leaves of a union PlenOctree structure. The resulting FPO enables compact memory overload for dynamic objects and supports efficient fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly faster than the original NeRF and achieves accelerated rendering while maintaining high visual quality for free-viewpoint rendering of unseen dynamic scenes.
