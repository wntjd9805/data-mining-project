Weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) is a more challenging task compared to weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) as it requires instance-wise localization, which is difficult to extract from image-level labels. Existing WSIS approaches often rely on off-the-shelf proposal techniques that require pre-training with instance or object level labels, deviating from the fully-image-level supervised setting. In this study, we propose a novel approach that includes two innovative components. Firstly, we introduce a semantic knowledge transfer method to obtain pseudo instance labels by leveraging the knowledge from WSSS, eliminating the need for off-the-shelf proposals. Secondly, we propose a self-refinement method to improve the quality of the pseudo instance labels in a self-supervised scheme, using the refined labels for online training. We identify a problem called semantic drift, where missing instances in pseudo instance labels are mistakenly categorized as background class, leading to confusion between background and instance during training and degrading segmentation performance. Our self-refinement method effectively addresses the semantic drift problem. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving significant performance without relying on off-the-shelf proposal techniques.
