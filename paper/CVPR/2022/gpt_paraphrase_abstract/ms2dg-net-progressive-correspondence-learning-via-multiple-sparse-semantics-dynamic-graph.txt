To improve the accuracy of computer vision tasks, it is crucial to establish high-quality correspondences between images. Previous approaches have relied on Euclidean distance to find neighboring correspondences and extract local information. However, these methods often overlook the sparse semantics similarity between images, leading to inadequate capture of local topology among correspondences. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called Multiple Sparse Semantics Dynamic Graph Network (MS2DG-Net). MS2DG-Net utilizes sparse semantics graphs to dynamically capture local topology among correspondences, while also maintaining permutation-equivariant properties. By predicting the probabilities of correspondences as inliers and recovering camera poses, MS2DG-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods in outlier removal and camera pose estimation tasks on publicly available datasets with significant outliers. The source code for MS2DG-Net can be accessed at https://github.com/changcaiyang/MS2DG-Net.
