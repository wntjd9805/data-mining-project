This study examines the current method of pixel-level optimization and inference in Euclidean output embedding spaces for image segmentation. It introduces hyperbolic manifolds as an alternative approach and presents a feasible formulation for hierarchical pixel-level classification in hyperbolic space. The utilization of Hyperbolic Image Segmentation offers several advantages including uncertainty estimation, boundary information without additional cost, generalization without labeling, and enhanced performance in low-dimensional output embeddings.
