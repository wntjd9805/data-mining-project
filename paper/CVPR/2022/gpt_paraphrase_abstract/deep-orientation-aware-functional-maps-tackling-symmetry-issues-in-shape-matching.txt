Current state-of-the-art intrinsic networks designed for non-rigid shape matching lack the ability to differentiate between symmetries within shapes. However, recent advancements in the functional map framework have made it possible to enforce the preservation of orientation by utilizing a functional representation for transferring tangent vector fields, known as complex functional maps. Leveraging this representation, we propose a novel deep learning approach that learns orientation-aware features in a completely unsupervised manner. Our architecture, based on DiffusionNet, ensures robustness to changes in discretization and incorporates a vector-field-based loss to promote orientation preservation without relying on extrinsic descriptors that are often prone to instability.
