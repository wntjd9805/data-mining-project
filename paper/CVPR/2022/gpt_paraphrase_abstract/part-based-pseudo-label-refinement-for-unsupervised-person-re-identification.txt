Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) is the task of learning distinctive representations for identifying individuals from unlabeled data. Current approaches use pseudo-labels, but these labels are noisy and reduce accuracy. To address this issue, various methods have been proposed to refine pseudo-labels, but they overlook the importance of fine-grained local context in person re-ID. In this study, we introduce a new framework called Part-based Pseudo Label Refinement (PPLR) that decreases label noise by leveraging the complementary relationship between global and part features. Our approach involves designing a cross agreement score that measures the similarity of k-nearest neighbors in different feature spaces, enabling us to exploit the reliable complementary relationship. Using the cross agreement score, we refine pseudo-labels for global features by combining the predictions of part features, effectively reducing noise in global feature clustering. Additionally, we refine pseudo-labels for part features by applying label smoothing based on the suitability of given labels for each part. By utilizing the reliable complementary information provided by the cross agreement score, our PPLR method successfully reduces the impact of noisy labels and learns discriminative representations with detailed local contexts. Extensive experiments on Market-1501 and MSMT17 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
