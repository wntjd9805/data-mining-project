Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) is a challenging task that involves matching faces across different domains, such as visible and thermal. Existing methods have attempted to bridge the domain gap through synthesis, but they are limited by the lack of paired training data. Acquiring large-scale heterogeneous face data is costly and often restricted by privacy regulations. In this research, we propose a new approach for HFR that addresses these limitations. Our method utilizes facial priors from the visible domain to enhance data-efficient synthesis and improve the fidelity of the generated faces. Additionally, we introduce a federated learning scheme that enables large-scale training without explicit data sharing, fostering collaborations among institutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming the challenges of HFR with current data limitations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in face hallucination on multiple HFR datasets within a unified framework.
