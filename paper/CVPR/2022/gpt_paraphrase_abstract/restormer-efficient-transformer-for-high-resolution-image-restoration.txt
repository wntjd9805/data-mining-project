Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for image restoration due to their ability to learn image priors from large-scale data. However, CNNs have limitations such as a limited receptive field and lack of adaptability to input content. On the other hand, Transformers have shown significant improvements in natural language and high-level vision tasks but suffer from high computational complexity when applied to high-resolution image restoration. To address this, we propose an efficient Transformer model called RestorationTransformer (Restormer) that captures long-range pixel interactions while remaining applicable to large images. Restormer achieves state-of-the-art results in various image restoration tasks including image deraining, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and image denoising. The source code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/swz30/Restormer.
