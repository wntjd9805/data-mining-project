A new camera localization technique has been developed that eliminates the need for storing large amounts of scene images or image features. Instead, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to encode the appearance of a sparse set of 3D scene points, referred to as scene landmarks. This CNN can detect these landmarks in query images, even if they are not visible in the camera's field-of-view. The CNN can also be trained to regress bearing vectors for these landmarks. The accuracy of this method has been demonstrated to outperform the current state-of-the-art in learned localization. Additionally, combining this technique with an existing accurate method further improves its accuracy. This approach addresses the resource constraints of VR/AR devices and privacy concerns associated with storing large amounts of data.
