Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) techniques that use image-level labels have gained popularity due to their cost-effectiveness. However, existing methods relying on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) often overlook valuable information in images, leading to incomplete localization maps. To address this limitation, we propose a Self-supervised Image-speciﬁc Prototype Exploration (SIPE) framework comprising of an Image-speciﬁc Prototype Exploration (IPE) and a General-Speciﬁc Consistency (GSC) loss. Our IPE tailors prototypes for each image to capture complete regions, resulting in the formation of our Image-Speciﬁc CAM (IS-CAM) through two sequential steps. Additionally, the GSC loss is introduced to establish consistency between the general CAM and our speciﬁc IS-CAM, enhancing feature representation and enabling self-correction in prototype exploration. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 segmentation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SIPE method achieves state-of-the-art performance using solely image-level labels. The source code for SIPE is available at https://github.com/chenqi1126/SIPE.
