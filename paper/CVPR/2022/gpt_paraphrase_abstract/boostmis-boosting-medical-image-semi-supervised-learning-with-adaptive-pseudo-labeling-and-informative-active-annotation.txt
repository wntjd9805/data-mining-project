In this paper, we introduce a new framework called BoostMIS for semi-supervised learning (SSL) in medical image analysis. BoostMIS combines adaptive pseudo labeling and informative active annotation to enhance SSL models for medical images. Firstly, BoostMIS utilizes the cluster assumption and consistency regularization of unlabeled data to generate "hard" labels that are converted from predictions made by the task model. This adaptive labeling strategy improves the training of the task model. Secondly, for unlabeled images with low confidence, BoostMIS employs an Active Learning (AL) algorithm to identify informative samples as potential annotations. This is done by leveraging virtual adversarial perturbation and the model's density-aware entropy. These informative samples are then included in the next training cycle to improve the propagation of SSL labels. Importantly, the adaptive pseudo-labeling and informative active annotation create a collaborative learning loop that boosts SSL performance in medical image analysis. To evaluate our proposed method, we collected a dataset for metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) to optimize diagnosis and classification for improved specialist referral and treatment. We conducted extensive experiments on the MESCC dataset and the results show that BoostMIS outperforms various state-of-the-art methods. The code for our framework is available on GitHub.
