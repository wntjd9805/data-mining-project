This paper introduces VCSL, a new dataset for video copy detection at the segment level. Unlike existing datasets, VCSL offers a larger amount of segment-level labelled data with 160k video copy pairs and over 280k localized copied segment pairs. It covers various video categories and durations. Each video pair includes manually extracted copied segments with annotated starting and ending timestamps. The paper also proposes an evaluation protocol that improves the accuracy of predicting copy overlapping segments between video pairs in different scenarios. The dataset is accompanied by benchmark codes and is publicly available. By comparing different methods using the dataset and evaluation metric, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of current approaches, identifying their strengths and weaknesses and suggesting future research directions. The VCSL dataset, metric, and benchmark codes can be accessed at https://github.com/alipay/VCSL.
