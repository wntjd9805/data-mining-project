Training a surrogate model for black-box adversarial attack remains challenging when access to the training data of the victim model is restricted. In this paper, we propose three key measures to improve the effectiveness of surrogate training. Firstly, instead of focusing on increasing inter-class diversity like existing methods, we suggest using a loss function introduced in this study to enhance inter-class similarity. Additionally, we introduce a specific loss function for the surrogate model to enhance intra-class diversity, departing from the implicit model-agnostic approaches. Finally, we argue that utilizing proxy data is still an effective strategy for surrogate training based on thorough observations of proxy data methods. To address this, we introduce a triple-player framework by incorporating a discriminator into the traditional data-free framework. This allows our method to perform well even when there is limited semantic overlap between the scarce proxy data (ranging from 1k to 5k) and the training data. We assess the performance of our method on various victim models and datasets, and the extensive results demonstrate its effectiveness.
