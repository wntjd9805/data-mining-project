A widely used image compression method called JPEG is commonly used by individuals, data centers, cloud storage, and network filesystems. However, recent advancements in image compression have primarily focused on uncompressed images, neglecting the trillions of already-existing JPEG images. In order to adequately compress these JPEG images and restore them back to their original format without any loss when necessary, we propose a deep learning-based method that operates on the DCT domain. We introduce a Multi-Level Cross-Channel Entropy Model to effectively compress the most informative Y component. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional JPEG recompression methods such as Lepton, JPEG XL, and CMIX, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learned compression method that can transcode JPEG images to bitstreams that save storage space.
