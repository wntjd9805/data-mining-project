This paper introduces a new research task called unified scene text detection and layout analysis, which combines two previously separate tasks. To facilitate this task, the authors create a hierarchical scene text dataset. They also propose a novel method that can simultaneously detect scene text and form text clusters in a unified manner. Through comprehensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that their unified model outperforms multiple baseline methods. Moreover, this model achieves state-of-the-art results on various scene text detection datasets without the need for complicated post-processing.
