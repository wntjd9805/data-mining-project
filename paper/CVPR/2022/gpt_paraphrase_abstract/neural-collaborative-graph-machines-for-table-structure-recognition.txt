Table structure recognition has made significant progress with the use of deep graph models. However, existing methods either rely on single visual cues or combine visual cues with other modalities through early fusion to reason about the graph relationships in tables. This approach is not suitable for all types of tables, as different modalities need to collaborate in different ways for different cases. The importance of intra-inter modality interactions for table structure reasoning has not been explored. To address this gap, we introduce the heterogeneous table structure recognition (Hetero-TSR) problem and propose a novel approach called Neural Collaborative Graph Machines (NCGM). NCGM utilizes stacked collaborative blocks to extract intra-modality context and model inter-modality interactions in a hierarchical manner. This allows for a more robust representation of the relationships between different modalities in table elements, leading to improved recognition performance. NCGM also has the ability to adjust the collaborative pattern of different modalities based on the context of intra-modality cues, which is crucial for handling diverse table cases. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed NCGM achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms other contemporary methods, especially in challenging scenarios.
