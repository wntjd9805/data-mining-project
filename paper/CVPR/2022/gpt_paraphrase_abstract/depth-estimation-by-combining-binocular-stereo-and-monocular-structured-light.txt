The passive stereo system is not suitable for detecting weak texture objects, such as white walls, which are commonly found in indoor environments. This paper introduces a new stereo system composed of an RGB camera, an IR camera, and an IR speckle projector. The RGB camera is utilized for both depth estimation and texture acquisition, while the IR camera and speckle projector create a monocu-lar structured-light (MSL) subsystem. The combination of the MSL subsystem and the binocular stereo subsystem formed by the two cameras improves the accuracy of stereo matching. To validate the system, a prototype is built, and a test dataset is collected from indoor scenes. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed system achieves a 28.2% reduction in error compared to the passive stereo system when using the RAFT network.
