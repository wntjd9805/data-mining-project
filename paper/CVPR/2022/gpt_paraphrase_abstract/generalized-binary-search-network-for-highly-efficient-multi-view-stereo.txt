We propose a new method for Multi-view Stereo (MVS) that significantly reduces memory usage while improving depth prediction performance. We approach MVS as a binary search problem and introduce a generalized binary search network. Each step of the search splits the depth range into two bins with an additional error tolerance bin on each side. A classification is then performed to determine which bin contains the true depth. We also implement mechanisms to handle classification errors, out-of-range samples, and reduce training memory. Our method samples a small number of depth hypotheses in each step, making it memory efficient and facilitating quick training convergence. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with considerably less memory usage. It outperforms other learning-based methods, achieving an overall score of 0.289 on the DTU dataset and ranking first on the challenging Tanks and Temples advanced dataset.
