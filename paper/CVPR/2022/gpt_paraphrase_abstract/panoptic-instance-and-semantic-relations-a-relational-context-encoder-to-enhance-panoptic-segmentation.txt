This paper introduces a new framework that combines semantic and instance contexts for panoptic segmentation. Previous methods have used a shared backbone to extract features for both countable and uncountable classes, but this approach fails to capture the complex relationships between them. To address this limitation, we propose the Panoptic, Instance, and Semantic Relations (PISR) module, which leverages these relationships. First, we generate panoptic encodings that summarize the important features of semantic classes and predicted instances. Then, we apply the Panoptic Relational Attention (PRA) module to these encodings and the global feature map from the backbone. This produces a feature map that captures the relationships between semantic classes, instances, and spatial features. Additionally, PISR automatically learns to prioritize the most important instances, making it robust to varying numbers of instances. Furthermore, PISR is a versatile module that can be used with any existing panoptic segmentation architecture. Through extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets like Cityscapes, COCO, and ADE20K, we demonstrate that PISR significantly improves upon existing approaches.
