Although end-to-end approaches have shown impressive performance in various perception tasks, they still lag behind 3D geometry-based methods when it comes to pose estimation. Additionally, it has been observed that absolute pose regression is more closely associated with image retrieval. This leads us to believe that the statistical features learned by traditional Convolutional Neural Networks lack the necessary geometric information to effectively solve this inherently geometric task. This paper presents a solution by showcasing how a translation and rotation equivariant Convolutional Neural Network can directly generate representations of camera motions in the feature space. This unique geometric property enables us to implicitly augment the training data using a range of image plane-preserving transformations. Consequently, we contend that learning equivariant features directly is more advantageous than learning intermediate representations that require extensive data.Through comprehensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our lightweight model surpasses existing models on standard datasets.
