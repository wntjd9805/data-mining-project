Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely recognized for their superior performance in image classification. However, recent research has highlighted the issue of unreliable predictions stemming from the CNNs' heavy reliance on biased training data. Current unbiased modeling approaches assume that the dataset's bias is easily identifiable, but this assumption is not applicable to image datasets with numerous sensory attributes. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that does not require a predefined bias. We leverage the observation that CNNs inherently possess multivariate and unbiased representations within the model. Our proposed framework utilizes hierarchical features extracted from multiple layers and employs orthogonal regularization to incorporate this internal information for unbiased learning. Through extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving unbiased learning.
