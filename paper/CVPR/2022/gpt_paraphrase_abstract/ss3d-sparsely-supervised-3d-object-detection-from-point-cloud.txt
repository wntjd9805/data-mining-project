We present SS3D, a sparsely-supervised 3D object detection method that reduces the need for expensive 3D bounding box annotations during training. Conventional deep learning methods require a large amount of annotations, making them impractical. Our approach addresses the challenge of missing-annotated instances by using a mining module to identify positive instances and a reliable background mining module to generate confident data. We also employ a point cloud filling data augmentation strategy for reliable supervision. SS3D is a general framework applicable to any modern 3D object detector. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that SS3D achieves comparable performance to fully-supervised methods with only 20% of the annotations required. It also outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised and weakly-supervised methods, demonstrating its effectiveness.
