Learning-based optical flow estimation has traditionally relied on a cost volume pipeline with convolutions for flow regression. However, this approach is limited to local correlations and struggles to handle large displacements. To address this challenge, the RAFT framework has achieved impressive performance by gradually improving prediction quality through iterative refinements, but at the cost of increasing inference time. In order to achieve both high accuracy and efficiency, we propose a new approach called GMFlow. This framework completely reformulates optical flow as a global matching problem, directly comparing feature similarities to identify correspondences. GMFlow consists of three main components: a customized Transformer for feature enhancement, a correlation and softmax layer for global feature matching, and a self-attention layer for flow propagation. We also introduce a refinement step that utilizes GMFlow at higher feature resolution for residual flow prediction. Our new framework outperforms the state-of-the-art RAFT framework on the challenging Sintel benchmark, while using only one refinement and running faster. This suggests a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation. The code for GMFlow is available at https://github.com/haofeixu/gmflow.
