Significant progress has been made in estimating 3D room layouts using deep neural networks and single panoramas. However, previous methods lack efficient geometry awareness of room layouts, relying solely on latitude boundaries or horizon-depth. This study introduces the use of horizon-depth and room height to achieve omnidirectional geometry awareness in both horizontal and vertical directions. Additionally, a novel loss function is proposed to supervise the planeness of walls and turning of corners, incorporating normals and gradients of normals. A network called LGT-Net is presented for room layout estimation, featuring a new Transformer architecture called SWG-Transformer to model geometry relations. SWG-Transformer includes Shifted Window Blocks and Global Blocks to combine local and global geometry relations. Furthermore, a unique relative position embedding of Transformer enhances spatial identification ability for panoramas. Experimental results demonstrate that LGT-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. The code for LGT-Net is publicly available at https://github.com/zhigangjiang/LGT-Net.
