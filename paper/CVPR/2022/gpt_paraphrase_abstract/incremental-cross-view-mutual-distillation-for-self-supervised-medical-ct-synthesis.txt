Computer tomography (CT) scans often have low within-slice resolution due to imaging device constraints and high operational costs. Improving the inter-slice resolution is important for accurate disease diagnosis by both human experts and computer-aided systems. In this study, we propose a novel method for increasing the inter-slice resolution through medical slice synthesis. Since ground-truth intermediate medical slices are not available in clinical practice, we employ an incremental cross-view mutual distillation strategy for self-supervised learning. Our approach models the problem from three different perspectives: slice-wise interpolation from axial view, and pixel-wise interpolation from coronal and sagittal views. By leveraging the valuable knowledge distilled from models trained on different views, we can synthesize intermediate slice data with progressively higher between-slice resolution. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on a large-scale CT dataset. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by a significant margin.
