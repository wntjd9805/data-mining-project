Detecting camouflaged objects accurately is a difficult task due to their similarity to the surrounding environment. Existing methods focus on single-stage detection, which overlooks small objects with low-resolution fine edges, requiring more operations. To address this, we propose SegMaR, an iterative refinement framework inspired by human attention and the coarse-to-fine detection strategy. SegMaR integrates Segment, Magnify, and Reiterate in a multi-stage detection fashion. We introduce a new discriminative mask that directs the model's attention towards fixation and edge regions. Additionally, we utilize an attention-based sampler to progressively magnify the object region without increasing the image size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMaR outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently. Notably, we achieve an average improvement of 7.4% and 20.0% over two competitive methods in detecting small camouflaged objects. Further analysis highlights the effectiveness of SegMaR's discriminative mask and its applicability to other network architectures.
