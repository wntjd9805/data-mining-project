This study aims to enhance the performance and interpretability of Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) models by incorporating symbolic knowledge. Existing VRD methods based on deep learning face challenges such as poor performance due to limited labeled examples and lack of interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a bi-level probabilistic graphical reasoning framework called BPGR, which integrates symbolic knowledge into deep learning models. In the high-level structure, the objects and relationships detected by the VRD model are considered as hidden variables (reasoning results). In the low-level structure of BPGR, First-Order Logic (FOL) is projected as observed variables (symbolic knowledge) using MarkovLogic Networks (MLNs) to correct erroneous reasoning results. An optimization process based on variational EM algorithm is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that BPGR enhances the performance of VRD models. Moreover, BPGR also offers easily understandable insights into the reasoning results, thus improving interpretability.
