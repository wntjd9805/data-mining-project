Supervised deep stereo matching networks have achieved impressive results, but their inability to generalize due to domain gaps limits their application in real-life scenarios. To address this issue, we propose using the features of a model trained on large-scale datasets, which have encountered various image styles. By using a cosine similarity based cost volume as a connection, we graft these features onto a regular cost aggregation module. However, these low-level features contain general information unrelated to stereo matching. To extract more task-specific information, we input the grafted features into a shallow network for transformation before calculating the cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this combination of broad-spectrum and task-oriented features significantly improves the model's generalization ability. Our methods outperform other robust algorithms, specifically PSMNet and GANet, when transferring from Scene-Flow to KITTI 2015, KITTI 2012, and Middlebury datasets.
