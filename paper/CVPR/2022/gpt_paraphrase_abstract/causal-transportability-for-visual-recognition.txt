The abstract discusses the issue of poor performance of image classifiers on out-of-distribution samples due to non-robust features and their correlations with labels. It highlights that standard classifiers fail because the association between images and labels cannot be transferred across different settings. However, the abstract proposes the concept of a causal effect that remains consistent across domains and suggests the development of an algorithm to estimate this causal effect for image classification. This algorithm is transportable across different environments and can improve generalization. The approach utilizes deep models and empirical assumptions to derive an estimand for the causal effect without the need for additional variables. The abstract concludes by mentioning that theoretical analysis, empirical results, and visualizations support the effectiveness of this approach in capturing causal invariances and enhancing overall generalization.
