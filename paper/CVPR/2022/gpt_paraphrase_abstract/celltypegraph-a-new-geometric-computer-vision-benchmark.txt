The task of classifying cells within an organ is a challenging and relevant problem in plant developmental biology. We have transformed this problem into a novel benchmark for node classification in a geo-referenced graph. The solution to this benchmark involves learning the spatial arrangement of the organ, including its symmetries. In order to facilitate the evaluation of new geometric learning methods, we provide a PyTorch data loader for the benchmark, specifically utilizing Arabidopsis thaliana ovules, along with a multitude of precomputed features. Additionally, we assess the performance of eight recent graph neural network architectures on this problem and determine that DeeperGCN currently delivers the best results.
