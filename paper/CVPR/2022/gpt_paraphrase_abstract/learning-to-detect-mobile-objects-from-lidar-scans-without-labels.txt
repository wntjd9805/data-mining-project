Current 3D object detectors used in autonomous driving heavily rely on human-annotated data, which is time-consuming and expensive to generate. This limits their applicability to only specific locations and object types. In contrast, this paper suggests an alternative approach that solely relies on unlabeled data, which can be easily obtained at a low cost from various locations worldwide. Our proposed method utilizes simple common sense heuristics to create initial approximate seed labels. These heuristics, such as the observation that relevant traffic participants do not persist across multiple traversals, do not fly, and are not underground, prove to be highly effective in bootstrapping a remarkably accurate object detector through repeated self-training without any human annotations.
