The recent development of Event-based Synthetic Aperture Imaging (E-SAI) has shown promise in overcoming dense occlusions. However, the performance of E-SAI is inconsistent when faced with sparse occlusions, mainly due to a significant decrease in signal events. To address this issue, this paper introduces a fusion-based SAI (EF-SAI) that combines the benefits of both events and frames, resulting in consistent performance across different occlusion densities. The proposed method utilizes multi-modal feature encoders to extract features from events and frames and employs a multi-stage fusion network for cross-modal enhancement and density-aware feature selection. Subsequently, a CNN decoder is utilized to generate occlusion-free visual images based on the selected features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively handles varying occlusion densities and outperforms existing SAI methods.
