We propose a new approach called HybridCR to address the high cost of labeling in large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation. In a weakly-supervised setting, HybridCR achieves competitive performance compared to fully-supervised methods. It is the first framework to combine point consistency and contrastive regularization with pseudo labeling in an end-to-end manner. HybridCR explicitly considers the semantic similarity between neighboring points and global characteristics of 3D classes. Additionally, we design a dynamic point cloud augmentor to generate diverse and robust sample views, optimizing its transformation parameter during model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HybridCR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor datasets, including S3DIS, ScanNet-V2, Semantic3D, and SemanticKITTI.
