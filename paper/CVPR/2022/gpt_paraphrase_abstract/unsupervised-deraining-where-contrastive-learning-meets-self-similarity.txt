The current state-of-the-art in image deraining involves decomposing a rainy image into clean and rain layers. Most existing methods are trained on synthetic data, which limits their performance on real rainy scenes. Additionally, these methods often overlook the relationship between the two layers. To address these limitations, we propose a new unsupervised image deraining method called non-local contrastive learning (NLCL). NLCL leverages the self-similarity within image patches and the mutually exclusive nature of the two layers to effectively differentiate the rain layer from the clean image. By pulling together similar positive samples and pushing away similar negative samples, NLCL enhances the discriminative representation of the layers. We also analyze the selection of a suitable feature encoder for NLCL. Extensive experiments on various real rainy datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
