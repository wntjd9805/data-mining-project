We present a new set of image transformations that can be used to assess the resilience of models and enhance the training of neural networks. These transformations incorporate the geometry of the scene, making them more representative of real-world corruptions compared to existing approaches like CommonCorruptions. In addition, we introduce semantic corruptions, such as object occlusions, which further enhance the realism of the transformations. Our transformations are efficient and can be computed on-the-fly, making them easily applicable to most image datasets. We demonstrate that these transformations expose vulnerabilities in existing models and can effectively improve model robustness when used as 3D data augmentation techniques. Our evaluations across various tasks and datasets suggest that incorporating 3D information into benchmarking and training is a promising avenue for robustness research.
