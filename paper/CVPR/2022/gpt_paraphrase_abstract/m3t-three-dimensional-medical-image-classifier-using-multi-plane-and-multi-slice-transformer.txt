This study introduces a new approach for classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 3D MRI images. The proposed method, called the Multi-plane and Multi-slice Transformer (M3T) network, combines three different types of neural networks: 3D CNN, 2D CNN, and Transformer. The 3D CNN is used to learn representations directly from the 3D images, while the 2D CNN utilizes pre-trained weights on 2D databases for representation learning. By incorporating CNN networks, the method effectively captures local information related to AD abnormalities in the brain. Additionally, the Transformer network is employed to establish attention relationships among different image planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) and slices, enabling it to learn abnormalities distributed over wider brain regions without any bias. The proposed M3T network is evaluated using a training dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and validation datasets from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL), the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS), and an independent subset of ADNI data. Performance comparison based on area under the curve (AUC) and classification accuracy demonstrates that the M3T network outperforms conventional 3D classification networks. This study showcases the potential of efficiently combining CNN and Transformer for accurate AD classification in 3D medical images.
