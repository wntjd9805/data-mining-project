Previous research has recognized the limitations of using the top-1 attack success rate (ASR) as a sole metric for evaluating attack strength. However, these studies have primarily focused on the white-box setting and have not explored the practical black-box setting, specifically transferable attacks. It is commonly believed that stronger Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM) attacks result in poorer transferability compared to simpler Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attacks, suggesting a conflict between transferability and white-box attack strength. In contrast, our study challenges this belief and presents empirical evidence that stronger attacks actually transfer better in terms of the general top-k ASR, as indicated by the interest class rank (ICR) after attack. Through an intuitive analysis of the logit gradient from a geometric perspective, we identify the weakness of commonly used losses, which prioritize the speed of fooling the network rather than maximizing attack strength. In light of this, we propose a new normalized Cross-Entropy (CE) loss that guides the logit updates in a way that implicitly maximizes the rank distance between the logit and the ground-truth class. Our proposed loss is shown to be simple yet effective for top-k attacks, as verified through extensive experiments in various settings.
