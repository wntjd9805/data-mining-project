Hyperspectral imaging has gained attention in computer vision for image classification and pattern recognition. However, current implementations rely on bulky and expensive optical components, hindering fast data processing for real-time and high-resolution videos. To address these limitations, this study introduces Hyplex™, a new integrated architecture that replaces bulk optics with nanoscale metasurfaces designed through artificial intelligence. Hyplex™ utilizes conventional monochrome cameras instead of spectrometers, enabling real-time and high-resolution hyperspectral imaging at a lower cost. The camera employs a model-driven optimization approach, connecting the physical metasurfaces layer with modern visual computing techniques. A prototype version of Hyplex™ is designed and implemented, outperforming the state-of-the-art in tasks like spectral reconstruction and semantic segmentation. Additionally, the study presents the largest publicly available labeled hyperspectral dataset for semantic segmentation.
