Recent studies in dentistry and maxillofacial imagery have focused on detecting the Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) canal. However, the performance of deep learning-based techniques has been limited due to the lack of available 3D maxillofacial datasets. On the other hand, a large amount of sparsely annotated data is generated daily from regular procedures in maxillofacial practice. Despite the significant amount of sparsely labeled images, there is an open problem regarding the utilization of this data.  Deep learning approaches heavily rely on dense annotations, which has led researchers to develop label propagation techniques to expand sparse annotations into dense labels. However, these methods have only shown marginal effectiveness in segmenting the alveolar nerve in CBCT scans. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new 3D dataset with dense annotations, which is publicly released. Using this dataset, a deep label propagation model is trained, resulting in better segmentation results than those reported in previous literature.  By combining the segmentation model trained on the 3D annotated data with label propagation, the state-of-the-art in Inferior Alveolar Nerve segmentation is significantly improved. This research contributes to the field by providing a valuable dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of deep label propagation for this specific task.
