This paper focuses on improving the segmentation performance of 3D point cloud data, specifically on scene boundaries. Current methods often struggle with accurately segmenting points at boundaries, leading to overall poor segmentation results. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel framework called contrastive boundary learning (CBL). The CBL framework enhances feature discrimination between points across boundaries by contrasting their representations with the help of scene contexts at multiple scales. The authors experimentally demonstrate that applying CBL to three different baseline methods consistently improves their performance on boundaries as well as overall performance metrics like mIoU. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method and emphasize the significance of accurately segmenting boundaries in 3D point cloud segmentation. The code and model for the proposed method will be publicly available at https://github.com/LiyaoTang/contrastBoundary.
