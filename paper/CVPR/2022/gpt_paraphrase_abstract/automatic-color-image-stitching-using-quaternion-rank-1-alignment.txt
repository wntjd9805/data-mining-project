This paper introduces a novel approach called quaternion rank-1 alignment (QR1A) model for accurate color image stitching. The authors propose a nested iterative algorithm based on the complex-valued alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the optimization problem of QR1A. They also propose a perceptual seam quality (PSQ) measure to quantitatively evaluate the performance of image stitching by calculating misalignments along the seamline. Using QR1A and PSQ, the authors present an automatic color image stitching framework called ACIS-QR1A. This framework incorporates automatic and iterative learning strategies to simultaneously learn the optimal seamline and local alignment. The authors conduct extensive experiments on challenging datasets and demonstrate that ACIS-QR1A can produce high-quality stitched images in various difficult scenarios such as large parallax, low textures, moving objects, and occlusions.
