Online action detection in streaming videos is a challenging task where the model must predict actions in real-time based solely on the observed frames. To improve predictions, we introduce GateHUB, which uses a position-guided gated cross-attention mechanism to emphasize or suppress informative parts of the history. GateHUB also incorporates Future-augmented History (FaH) to enhance history features by leveraging subsequent frames. By integrating the transformer and recurrent models, GateHUB effectively models long-range temporal dependencies and selectively encodes relevant information. Additionally, GateHUB introduces a background suppression objective to reduce false positive background frames that resemble action frames. Through extensive validation on three benchmark datasets, GateHUB outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Notably, a flow-free version of GateHUB achieves comparable accuracy at a significantly higher frame rate compared to methods that require both RGB and optical flow information.
