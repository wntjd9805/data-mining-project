Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to develop metric spaces that capture semantic similarities by representing them as distances in an embedding space. These spaces should be applicable to classes not encountered during training. However, current DML methods focus on solving contrastive ranking tasks based on binary class assignments, disregarding higher-level semantic relationships between the actual classes. As a result, the learned embedding spaces lack complete semantic context and fail to accurately represent the semantic relation between classes, limiting their generalizability. To address this limitation, we propose a language guidance objective for visual similarity learning. By incorporating language embeddings of expert- and pseudo-class names, we contextualize and align visual representation spaces based on meaningful language semantics, thereby improving semantic consistency. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and its model-agnostic benefits for DML. Our method achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. The code for our approach is available at github.com/ExplainableML/LanguageGuidance for DML.
