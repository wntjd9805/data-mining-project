We investigate a novel problem involving the detection of hands and the identification of the corresponding person for each detected hand. This task has practical applications in areas such as hand tracking and hand contact estimation. However, associating hands with people becomes challenging in uncontrolled environments due to the presence of multiple individuals with varying degrees of overlap and occlusion.To address this challenge, we propose an innovative convolutional network that can detect hands and determine the body location of the corresponding person simultaneously. Our approach involves the initial detection of hands and bodies, followed by the use of a Hand-Body Association Network to predict association scores between them. These association scores are then utilized to identify the body location for each detected hand.Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset named BodyHands, which contains unconstrained images with annotations of hand and corresponding body locations. We perform extensive experiments on both the BodyHands dataset and another publicly available dataset to showcase the effectiveness of our method.Finally, we showcase the advantages of hand-body association in two critical applications: hand tracking and hand contact estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that reasoning about the association between hands and bodies significantly enhances the performance of hand tracking and hand contact estimation methods.For additional information, including code and data, please visit our website at http://vision.cs.stonybrook.edu/Ëœsupreeth/BodyHands/.
