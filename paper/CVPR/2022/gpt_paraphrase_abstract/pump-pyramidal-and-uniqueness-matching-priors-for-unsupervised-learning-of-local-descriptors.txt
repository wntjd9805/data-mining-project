Current methods for learning local image descriptors have achieved impressive results in various geometric tasks. However, these methods often require supervision at the pixel level, which is challenging to obtain in large quantities and with high quality. This paper proposes a new approach that combines two matching priors into a single loss function to learn local descriptors without supervision. The approach involves extracting pixel descriptors from two images of the same scene and constructing a correlation volume. The first prior ensures the local consistency of matches in the volume by iteratively constructing a pyramidal structure using a non-parametric module. The second prior takes advantage of the fact that each descriptor should only match with one descriptor from the other image. The unsupervised loss is combined with a self-supervised loss trained using synthetic image augmentations. The feature descriptors learned through this approach outperform both fully-supervised and self-supervised counterparts in various geometric benchmarks, such as visual localization and image matching, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
