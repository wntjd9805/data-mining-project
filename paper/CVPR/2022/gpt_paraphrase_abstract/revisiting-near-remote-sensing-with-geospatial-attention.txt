This study focuses on segmenting overhead images by utilizing auxiliary ground-level images. Previous research has shown that combining these two types of images, known as near/remote sensing, can greatly enhance accuracy. To build upon this research, we introduce the concept of geospatial attention, which is an attention mechanism that takes into account the geographical relationship between pixels in a ground-level image and a specific location. Our approach calculates geospatial attention by considering geometric features and the appearance of both the overhead and ground-level images. We propose a new architecture for near/remote sensing that incorporates geospatial attention and demonstrate its effectiveness in five segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
