This study addresses the complex task of reconstructing liquids using image data. Unlike previous works that focused on rigid and deforming surfaces, reconstructing liquids poses unique challenges due to factors such as variable index of refraction, opacity, and environmental reflections, which make it difficult to utilize depth sensing and color features. Consequently, our approach is limited to surface detections of liquids through binary masks, without relying on any prior knowledge of the liquid properties. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel optimization problem that reconstructs the liquid as particles. This optimization minimizes the error between a rendered surface generated from the particles and the surface detections, while also adhering to liquid constraints. Our optimization solvers are introduced, and the advantage is that they do not require any training data. Additionally, we suggest a dynamic prediction method to initialize the reconstruction optimization based on the previous time-step. To evaluate our methods, we conduct simulations and test them on two new liquid datasets, which we have made publicly available for further research in this relatively unexplored domain.
