Detecting symmetries in images is challenging due to the arbitrary orientations of symmetry patterns. Reflection symmetry mirrors itself against an axis with a specific orientation, while rotation symmetry matches its rotated copy with a specific orientation. To address this challenge, we propose EquiSym, a group-equivariant convolutional network for symmetry detection. EquiSym leverages equivariant feature maps that consistently vary with reflection and rotation of the image. The network is built end-to-end with dihedrally-equivariant layers and is trained to output a spatial map indicating reflection axes or rotation centers. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset called DENDI, which overcomes limitations of existing benchmarks for reflection and rotation symmetry detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LDRS and DENDI datasets.
