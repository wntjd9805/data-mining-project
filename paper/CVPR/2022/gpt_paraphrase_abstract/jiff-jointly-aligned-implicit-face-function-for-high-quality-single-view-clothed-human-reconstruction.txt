This paper aims to improve single view 3D human reconstruction, specifically focusing on enhancing the quality of facial details in the reconstructions. While recent implicit function based methods have shown impressive results, they often fail to accurately capture fine face details, which negatively affects user experience in applications like 3D telepresence. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Jointly-aligned Implicit Face Function (JIFF) that combines the strengths of implicit function based and model based approaches. Our method utilizes a 3D morphable face model as a shape prior and computes space-aligned 3D features that capture detailed face geometry information. These features are then combined with pixel-aligned 2D features to jointly predict an implicit face function, resulting in high quality face reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a coarse-to-fine architecture to predict high quality texture for the detailed face model. Extensive evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our proposed JIFF outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.
