Source-free object detection (SFOD) is the process of adapting a pre-trained detector from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Current SFOD methods use pseudo labeling, which involves predicting pseudo labels and fine-tuning the model. However, this approach suffers from inaccurate pseudo labels due to domain shift and limited use of target domain training data. In this study, we propose a new method called Learning to Overlook Domain Style (LODS) to overcome these limitations. Our approach focuses on reducing the domain shift effect by making the model ignore the target domain style, simplifying model adaptation. We achieve this by enhancing the style of each target domain image and using the style degree difference between the original and enhanced images as a self-supervised signal for model adaptation. To facilitate this process, we utilize a student-teacher architecture and a novel style enhancement algorithm with a graph alignment constraint. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LODS achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks.
