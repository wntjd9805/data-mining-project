This paper introduces a new method called R(Det)2 that combines decision trees and deep neural networks for object detection. The decision head is a crucial component in object detection, but designing a high-performance decision head is still an unresolved problem. The proposed approach disentangles decision choices and prediction values by integrating soft decision trees into neural networks. To enhance learning, the researchers introduce randomized decision routing with node selective and associative losses, which simultaneously improve feature representation learning and network decision. Additionally, the decision head for object detection is developed with narrow branches to generate routing probabilities and masks, allowing for divergent decisions from different nodes. Experimental results on the MS-COCO dataset demonstrate that R(Det)2 effectively enhances detection performance, achieving an improvement in average precision (AP) of 1.4% to 3.6% when combined with existing detectors.
