This study focuses on the problem of adversarial patch attacks, which pose a serious threat to object detectors in security-critical systems. The authors propose a defense framework called Segment and Complete (SAC) that aims to detect and remove adversarial patches. The first step is training a patch segmenter to identify the patches in images. A self adversarial training algorithm is then used to enhance the robustness of the patch segmenter. Additionally, a shape completion algorithm is designed to remove the entire patch from images based on the segmenter's outputs. The experiments conducted on COCO and xView datasets demonstrate that SAC achieves superior robustness against strong adaptive attacks without compromising performance on clean images. It also generalizes well to unseen patch shapes, attack budgets, and attack methods. The authors introduce the APRICOT-Mask dataset, which includes pixel-level annotations of adversarial patches, and show that SAC can significantly reduce the success rate of targeted physical patch attacks. The code for SAC is available on GitHub.
