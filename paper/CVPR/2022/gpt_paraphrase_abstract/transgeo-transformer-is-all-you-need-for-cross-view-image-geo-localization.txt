We propose TransGeo, a pure transformer-based approach for cross-view image geo-localization, as an alternative to the dominant CNN-based methods that use polar transform and lack global correlation modeling. TransGeo capitalizes on the strengths of transformers, such as their ability to model global information and encode explicit position information. Additionally, we introduce an attention-guided non-uniform cropping method within TransGeo, which eliminates uninformative image patches to reduce computation cost without compromising performance. By reallocating the saved computation to increase resolution for informative patches, TransGeo achieves performance improvement without additional computational burden. This approach mirrors human behavior of attending to relevant details in images. Remarkably, TransGeo outperforms CNN-based methods in both urban and rural datasets while requiring significantly less computation. It does not rely on polar transform and infers faster than CNN-based methods. The code for TransGeo is available at https://github.com/Jeff-Zilence/TransGeo2022.
