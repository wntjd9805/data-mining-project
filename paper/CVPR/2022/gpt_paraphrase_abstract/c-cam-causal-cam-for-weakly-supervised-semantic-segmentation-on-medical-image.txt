In recent years, there have been several advancements in weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using class activation mapping (CAM). However, the specific characteristics of medical images have not been thoroughly considered in these works. This paper addresses this gap by identifying two main challenges in WSSS for medical images: 1) the lack of clear boundaries between object foreground and background, and 2) the presence of severe co-occurrence phenomena during the training stage. To overcome these challenges, we propose a method called Causal CAM (C-CAM) which is motivated by two cause-effect chains: the category-causality chain and the anatomy-causality chain. The category-causality chain represents how the content of an image (cause) affects its category (effect), while the anatomy-causality chain represents how the anatomical structure (cause) affects organ segmentation (effect). We conducted extensive experiments on three public medical image datasets and found that C-CAM produces the best pseudo masks, achieving a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 77.26%, 80.34%, and 78.15% on the ProMRI, ACDC, and CHAOS datasets, respectively, compared to other CAM-like methods. Furthermore, the pseudo masks generated by C-CAM are used to improve the segmentation performance for organ segmentation tasks, achieving a DSC of 83.83% on ProMRI and 87.54% on ACDC, surpassing state-of-the-art WSSS methods. The code for our C-CAM method is publicly available at https://github.com/Tian-lab/C-CAM.
