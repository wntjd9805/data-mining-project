Unsupervised video anomaly detection methods are not as prevalent as weakly-supervised and one-class classification settings, likely due to the infrequency and vague nature of anomalies, combined with the lack of ground truth supervision. However, developing such methods is challenging yet beneficial as it eliminates the need for laborious annotations and enables automated deployment. In this study, we propose a new unsupervised Generative Cooperative Learning (GCL) approach for video anomaly detection. Our approach leverages the rarity of anomalies to establish a cross-supervision between a generator and a discriminator, allowing for cooperative unsupervised learning. We evaluate our method on two large-scale video anomaly detection datasets (UCF crime and ShanghaiTech) and consistently achieve improved results compared to existing unsupervised and one-class classification methods.
