Existing research on model-based blind single image super-resolution (SISR) has made significant progress, but it often overlooks the issue of image degradation. This is mainly due to two factors. Firstly, the assumption that image noise follows an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian or Laplacian distribution underestimates the complexity of real noise. Secondly, commonly-used kernel priors, such as normalization and sparsity, are not effective enough to ensure a reasonable kernel solution, leading to poor performance in SISR.   To address these issues, this paper proposes a model-based blind SISR method that takes into account image degradation from the perspectives of noise and blur kernel, using a probabilistic framework. Rather than assuming i.i.d. noise, a patch-based non-i.i.d. noise model is introduced to capture the complexity of real noise, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in noise representation. Additionally, a concise yet effective kernel generator is developed as an explicit kernel prior (EKP) to enhance the performance of the proposed blind SISR method.   To solve the proposed model, a Monte Carlo EM algorithm is specifically designed, grounded in theoretical principles. Comprehensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art approaches.
