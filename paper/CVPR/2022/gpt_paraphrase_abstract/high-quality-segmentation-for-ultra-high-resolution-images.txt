Segmenting ultra high-resolution images, such as 4K or 6K, requires careful consideration of computational requirements. Traditional approaches like down-sampling, patch cropping, and cascade models struggle to strike a balance between accuracy and computation cost. In light of the human ability to distinguish objects gradually from coarse to precise levels, we introduce the Continuous Refinement Model (CRM) for refining segmentation in ultra high-resolution images. CRM aligns the feature map with the refinement target and aggregates features to reconstruct image details. Additionally, our CRM demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, bridging the resolution gap between low-resolution training images and ultra high-resolution testing images. We provide quantitative performance evaluation and visualization to demonstrate the speed and effectiveness of our proposed method for image segmentation refinement. The code for this model can be found at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Entity/tree/main/CRM.
