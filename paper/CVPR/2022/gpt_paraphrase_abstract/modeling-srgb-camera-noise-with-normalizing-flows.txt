Noise modeling and reduction are important tasks in computer vision, especially for smartphone cameras with small sensors that produce noticeable noise. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using data-driven approaches, specifically neural networks, to enhance camera noise models. These approaches focus on the noise present in the raw-sensor image, before any processing is done by the camera's image signal processor (ISP). While modeling noise in the RAW-rgb domain is useful for improving and testing in-camera denoising algorithms, there are situations where the ISP either does not apply denoising or additional denoising is desired when the RAW-rgb domain image is no longer available. In such cases, the sensor noise propagates through the ISP and affects the final rendered image encoded in standard RGB (sRGB). The ISP's nonlinear steps result in a more complex noise distribution in the sRGB domain, which existing raw-domain noise models fail to capture. To address this, we propose a new sRGB-domain noise model based on normalizing flows. Our model can learn the intricate noise distribution in sRGB images under different ISO levels. Our approach significantly outperforms other models in noise modeling and synthesis tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that denoisers trained on noisy images synthesized using our noise model outperform those trained with noise from baseline models.
