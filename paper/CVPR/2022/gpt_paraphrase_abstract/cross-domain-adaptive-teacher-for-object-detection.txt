The problem of domain adaptation in object detection involves bridging the gap between a domain with labeled data (source) and a domain without labeled data (target). A popular method for semi-supervised learning, called the teacher-student framework, has improved accuracy in cross-domain object detection. However, this framework has limitations due to domain shift and the generation of low-quality pseudo labels, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a new teacher-student framework called Adaptive Teacher (AT). AT utilizes domain adversarial learning and weak-strong data augmentation to overcome the domain gap. Specifically, we incorporate feature-level adversarial training in the student model to ensure that features from both source and target domains have similar distributions, making the student model produce domain-invariant features. Additionally, we employ weak-strong augmentation and mutual learning between the teacher and student models, allowing the teacher model to learn from the student model without bias towards the source domain. Our experiments demonstrate that AT outperforms existing approaches and even fully-supervised Oracle models by a significant margin. For instance, we achieve a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.9% (49.3%) on Foggy Cityscape (Clipart1K), which is 9.2% (5.2%) and 8.2% (11.0%) higher than previous state-of-the-art methods and Oracle models, respectively.
