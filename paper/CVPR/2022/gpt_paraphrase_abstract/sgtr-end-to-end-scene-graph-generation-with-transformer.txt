Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a complex task in visual understanding that is challenging due to its compositional nature. Previous approaches have either used a two-stage bottom-up or a one-stage point-based approach, but these methods have drawbacks such as high time complexity and sub-optimal designs. To address these issues, this study proposes a new SGG method that formulates the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. A transformer-based end-to-end framework is developed to solve this problem, which first generates entity and predicate proposals and then infers directed edges to form relation triplets. The study introduces a novel entity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator that utilizes the compositional property of relationships. Additionally, a graph assembling module is designed to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph using the entity-aware structure, enabling the generation of the scene graph in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on challenging benchmarks, outperforming most existing methods and exhibiting higher inference efficiency. The proposed model can serve as a strong baseline for Transformer-based scene graph generation.
