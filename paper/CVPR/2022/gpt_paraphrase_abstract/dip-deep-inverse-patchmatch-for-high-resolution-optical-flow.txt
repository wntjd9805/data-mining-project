The dense correlation volume method has become the leading approach for optical flow estimation. However, it requires a large amount of memory, which hinders its performance on high-resolution images. To address this issue, we propose a new framework based on Patchmatch for high-resolution optical flow estimation. Our approach is the first end-to-end Patchmatch based deep learning optical flow method, which achieves high-precision results while consuming less memory. We introduce a novel inverse propagation technique to simplify the complex operations involved in propagation, leading to significant reduction in calculations. Our method outperforms other optical flow methods on the popular KITTI2015 benchmark and ranks second in terms of EPE on the Sintel clean benchmark. Additionally, our method demonstrates strong generalization ability across different datasets, achieving a 21% reduction in F1-all compared to the best published result on KITTI2015. Furthermore, our method preserves fine details on high-resolution datasets like DAVIS and consumes 2Ã— less memory than the RAFT method. The code for our method will be made available at github.com/zihuazheng/DIP.
