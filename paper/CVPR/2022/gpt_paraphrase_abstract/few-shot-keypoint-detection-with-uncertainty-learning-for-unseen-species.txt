Current keypoint detectors for non-rigid objects perform well on specific species and body parts, but they require a large amount of labeled keypoints for training. Additionally, these detectors are unable to recognize novel keypoints on unseen species using their tailored heatmaps. Therefore, we propose a versatile Few-shot Keypoint Detection (FSKD) pipeline that can detect both base and novel keypoints for unseen species with only a few annotated samples. Our FSKD includes main and auxiliary keypoint representation learning, similarity learning, and keypoint localization with uncertainty modeling to address localization noise. We also model uncertainty across groups of keypoints using a multivariate Gaussian distribution to exploit correlations between neighboring keypoints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FSKD in novel keypoint detection for unseen species, few-shot Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR), and Semantic Alignment (SA) tasks. In FGVR, the detected keypoints improve classification accuracy, while in SA, we introduce a novel thin-plate-spline warping technique that incorporates estimated keypoint uncertainty when dealing with imperfect keypoint correspondences.
