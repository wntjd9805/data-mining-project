This paper introduces a novel instance segmentation approach called BoundaryFormer, which addresses the challenges of using polygonal boundaries for object representation. While polygonal boundaries are advantageous for various computer vision tasks, they face issues related to supervision and performance parity compared to pixel-based methods. Although object instances are annotated using polygonal boundaries or segmentation masks, evaluation is typically done using only segmentation masks. To overcome this, BoundaryFormer is developed as a Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts polygons but uses instance mask segmentations as ground-truth supervision. This is achieved through differentiable rasterization, enabling end-to-end differentiability. BoundaryFormer outperforms the Mask R-CNN method in terms of instance segmentation quality on both COCO and Cityscapes datasets and exhibits superior transferability across datasets.
