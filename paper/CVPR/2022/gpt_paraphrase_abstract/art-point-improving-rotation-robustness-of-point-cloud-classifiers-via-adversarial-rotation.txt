This study introduces a novel approach called ART-Point for achieving rotation robustness in point cloud classifiers. Unlike existing methods that either use rotation invariant descriptors or design rotation equivariant networks, ART-Point utilizes adversarial training to improve rotation robustness. The rotation of the point cloud is treated as an attack, and the classifier is trained on inputs with AdversarialRotations. An axis-wise rotation attack is proposed, using back-propagated gradients of the pre-trained model to find effective adversarial rotations. To prevent model overfitting, rotation pools are constructed to increase the diversity of training data by leveraging the transferability of adversarial rotations. Additionally, a fast one-step optimization method is proposed for efficient attainment of the final robust model. Experimental results demonstrate that the rotation attack achieves a high success rate, and ART-Point outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both rotation robustness and performance on clean datasets.
