We have developed an algorithm that can detect planar shapes in unorganized 3D point clouds. The algorithm improves upon an initial configuration by refining the parameters of the plane and assigning input points to the planes. We prioritize accuracy, simplicity, and completeness in our approach. Our algorithm incorporates an exploration mechanism guided by a multi-objective energy function, which helps navigate the vast solution space. We employ five geometric operators to create, remove, and modify primitives during the transition process. We have tested our method on various scenes and sensors, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing methods for fitting primitives. Additionally, we highlight its usefulness in compact mesh reconstruction when combined with a plane assembly method.
