This study introduces and examines a comprehensive group of renderers that are capable of being differentiated. We explore the essential components needed for differentiable rendering and establish the requirements for each component. We implement our generalized differentiable renderer by incorporating various smoothing distributions to encompass a wide range of practical scenarios. To assess the performance of different instantiations of the differentiable renderer, we conduct evaluations using the widely-used ShapeNet 3D reconstruction benchmark and analyze the implications of our findings. Surprisingly, the uniform distribution produces the best overall outcomes when considering 13 classes on average. Nevertheless, the optimal choice of distribution varies significantly depending on the specific task at hand.
