This paper focuses on the issue of document image de-warping, which aims to remove geometric distortion in document images for digitization purposes. Instead of improving neural network designs to approximate the optical flow fields between inputs and outputs, we prioritize achieving the best readability by considering text lines and document boundaries from a constrained optimization perspective. Our method involves learning the boundary points and pixels within text lines, and utilizes a grid regularization scheme that preserves boundaries and text lines in both horizontal and vertical directions during the de-warping process. We solve an optimization problem with our proposed grid regularization to obtain the final forward mapping for de-warping. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods in terms of readability (measured by Character Error Rate and Edit Distance), while maintaining superior image quality on the publicly-available DocUNet benchmark.
