This paper presents a weakly-supervised approach for 3D object detection using position-level annotations. The proposed method, called Back to Reality (BR), addresses the information loss from box annotations to object centers by utilizing synthetic 3D shapes to convert weak labels into fully-annotated virtual scenes. These virtual labels are then used to refine and complement the real labels.   Specifically, the approach assembles 3D shapes into realistic virtual scenes based on the coarse scene layout extracted from position-level annotations. A virtual-to-real domain adaptation method is applied to refine the weak labels and supervise the training of the detector using the virtual scenes.   Additionally, the paper introduces a more diverse benchmark for indoor 3D object detection, specifically focusing on object sizes, to improve evaluation. The proposed method achieves comparable detection performance to popular fully-supervised approaches on the ScanNet dataset, with less than 5% of the labeling labor.
