This study introduces the Identity Consistency Transformer, an innovative approach for detecting face forgery. The method focuses on high-level semantics, particularly identity information, and identifies suspicious faces by identifying inconsistencies in both inner and outer face regions. The Identity Consistency Transformer includes a consistency loss to determine identity consistency. The study demonstrates that this transformer has excellent generalization capabilities across different datasets and various types of image degradation commonly found in real-world applications, including deepfake videos. Moreover, the Identity Consistency Transformer can easily incorporate additional identity information, making it particularly suitable for detecting face forgeries involving celebrities.
