Discriminative representation plays a crucial role in multi-object tracking, specifically in the association step. Previous research has focused on using features from single or neighboring frames to construct metric loss and enhance network capabilities in extracting target representations. While this approach has proven effective, it fails to fully utilize the information available in an entire trajectory. To address this, we propose a new strategy called multi-view trajectory contrastive learning. In this strategy, each trajectory is represented as a center vector, and a memory bank is used to store and update all the vectors. A trajectory-level contrastive loss is then employed to explore inter-frame information across the entire trajectories. Additionally, instead of using a predefined anchor or center, each target is represented by multiple adaptively selected keypoints. This allows the network to generate richer representations from different viewpoints of the same target, enabling better characterization of occluded objects. Furthermore, during the inference stage, a similarity-guided feature fusion strategy is developed to further enhance the quality of the trajectory representation. We conducted extensive experiments on MOTChallenge to validate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques. The results show that our method outperforms previous trackers and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.
