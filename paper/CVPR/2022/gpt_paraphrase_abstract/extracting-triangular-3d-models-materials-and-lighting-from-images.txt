We present a method that efficiently optimizes the topology, materials, and lighting of 3D models using multi-view image observations. Unlike previous approaches, our method generates triangle meshes with spatially-varying materials and environment lighting that can be used in traditional graphics engines without modification. We utilize differentiable rendering and coordinate-based networks to represent volumetric texturing in a compact manner. Additionally, we employ differentiable marching tetrahedrons for gradient-based optimization directly on the surface mesh. We also propose a differentiable formulation of the split sum approximation of environment lighting, which enables efficient recovery of all-frequency lighting. Experimental results demonstrate that our extracted models can be used for advanced scene editing, material decomposition, and high-quality view interpolation, all while achieving interactive rates in triangle-based renderers such as rasterizers and path tracers.
