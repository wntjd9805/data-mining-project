Histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) are increasingly being classified using multiple instance learning (MIL). However, MIL approaches for this classification problem face challenges, especially with small sample cohorts. These cohorts have a limited number of WSI slides (bags), but each slide has a large number of patches (instances) due to its high resolution. To tackle this issue, we propose using pseudo-bags to virtually increase the number of bags. We then build a double-tier MIL framework to effectively utilize the intrinsic features. Additionally, we contribute by deriving the instance probability within an attention-based MIL framework and using this derivation to analyze and construct our proposed framework. Our method outperforms other recent methods by a significant margin on the CAMELYON-16 dataset and also performs better on the TCGA lung cancer dataset. Furthermore, our framework can be extended for wider MIL applications. The code for our proposed method is available at https://github.com/hrzhang1123/DTFD-MIL.
