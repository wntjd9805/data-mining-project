This paper introduces a novel approach to depth sensing using thermal radiation. The proposed method offers several advantages, such as being passive, not relying on texture, applicable in far-range scenarios, and suitable for dark scenes. The key insight is that thermal radiation is affected by air and varies with wavelength. By creating a model that accounts for the wavelength-dependent attenuation caused by air and developing a multi-spectral LWIR measurement system, we can simultaneously estimate the depth, temperature, and emissivity of the target. The paper presents analytical evidence of the effectiveness of the thermal radiation cue and demonstrates its practicality in real-world situations using an imaging system equipped with a few bandpass filters.
