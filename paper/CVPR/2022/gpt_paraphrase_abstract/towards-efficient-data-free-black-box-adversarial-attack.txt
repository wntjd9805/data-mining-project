Black-box adversarial attacks exploit transferable adversarial examples created by a similar substitute model to deceive the target model. However, acquiring training data for these substitute models is challenging due to privacy and transmission constraints. Recent studies have addressed this issue by training substitute models in a data-free black-box scenario. However, their framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) suffers from convergence failure and model collapse, resulting in low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box attack framework that reconsiders the collaborative relationship between the generator and the substitute model. Our method efficiently mimics the target model with a small number of queries, achieving a high attack success rate. Extensive experiments conducted on six datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against state-of-the-art attacks. Notably, we perform label-only and probability-only attacks on the Microsoft Azure online model, achieving a 100% attack success rate with just 0.46% of the query budget required by the current best method [49].
