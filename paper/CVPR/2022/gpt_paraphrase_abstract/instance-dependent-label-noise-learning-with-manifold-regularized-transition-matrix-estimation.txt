Estimating the transition matrix in label-noise learning is crucial for building accurate classifiers. However, it is difficult to estimate this matrix due to the instance-dependent noise. To tackle this problem, we observe that humans tend to mislabel instances with similar appearances to the same classes. Based on this observation, we propose an assumption that states "the closer two instances are, the more similar their corresponding transition matrices should be." We incorporate this assumption into a manifold embedding technique to effectively reduce the complexity of estimating the transition matrix. Our approach reduces estimation errors without compromising the approximation error. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches in handling label-noise learning with instance-dependent noise.
