Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been successful in compressing image datasets using the bits-back coding framework. However, current VAE architectures face limitations in coding practicalities and compression ratios. To address this, we propose Split Hierarchical Variational Compression (SHVC). SHVC introduces two innovations: an efficient autoregressive prior called autoregressive sub-pixel convolution, and a coding framework called autoregressive initial bits that supports parallel coding and overcomes practical challenges associated with bits-back coding. Our experiments show that SHVC achieves state-of-the-art compression performance in lossless image compression tasks with significantly fewer model parameters compared to competing VAE approaches.
