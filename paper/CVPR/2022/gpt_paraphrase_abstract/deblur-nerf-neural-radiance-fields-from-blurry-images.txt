Deblur-NeRF is a novel method proposed to address the issue of image blurriness in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) reconstruction. NeRF has gained popularity for its high-quality synthesis of 3D scenes, but blurry input significantly degrades its reconstruction quality. Deblur-NeRF adopts an analysis-by-synthesis approach to reconstruct blurry views by simulating the blurring process, making NeRF robust to blurry inputs. The key component of this simulation is the Deformable Sparse Kernel (DSK) module, which models spatially-varying blur kernels by deforming a canonical sparse kernel at each spatial location. Inspired by the physical blurring process, the ray origin of each kernel point is jointly optimized. The DSK module is parameterized as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that can be generalized to different types of blur. By jointly optimizing the NeRF and DSK module, Deblur-NeRF restores a sharp NeRF. The method is evaluated on both camera motion blur and defocus blur, the two most common types of blur in real scenes. Results from synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that Deblur-NeRF outperforms several baseline methods. The synthetic and real datasets, as well as the source code, are publicly available at https://limacv.github.io/deblurnerf/.
