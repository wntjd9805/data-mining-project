Point-based object localization (POL) has gained attention for its ability to achieve high-performance object sensing with low-cost data annotation. However, the use of point annotations introduces semantic variance due to inconsistencies in annotated points. Existing POL methods heavily depend on accurate key-point annotations, which can be challenging to define. This study proposes a POL method that uses coarse point annotations instead, allowing for more flexibility in spotting points. To address the issue of semantic variance, a coarse point refinement (CPR) approach is introduced. CPR utilizes multiple instance learning (MIL) to select semantic-correlated points and generate semantic center points through the construction of point bags. This weakly supervised evolution procedure ensures the training of a high-performance object localizer under coarse point supervision. The effectiveness of the CPR approach is validated through experiments on COCO, DOTA, and a newly proposed dataset called SeaPerson.
