Digital watermarking is commonly used to protect copyright. However, existing methods for embedding and retrieving messages in 3D meshes are not applicable when users only have access to 2D rendered images. This is a challenging and underexplored problem. To address this, we propose a new learning framework that includes an encoder to covertly embed messages in both mesh geometry and textures, a differentiable renderer to generate watermarked 3D objects from various camera angles and lighting conditions, and a decoder to recover the messages from 2D rendered images. Our experiments demonstrate that our model can embed information that is visually imperceptible to humans and successfully retrieve the embedded information from 2D renderings with 3D distortions. Furthermore, our method is compatible with other renderers and does not require fine-tuning.
