Less than 35% of recyclable waste in the US is actually being recycled, causing soil and sea pollution and raising concerns among environmental researchers and the general public. The inefficiencies of the waste sorting process, due to the complex and cluttered nature of the waste stream, are at the core of this problem. Detecting recyclable waste poses a unique challenge for computer vision, as it requires identifying deformable and translucent objects in cluttered scenes without the usual context information found in human-centric datasets. However, there is currently a lack of suitable datasets and methods for this task in the existing literature. To address this, we introduce ZeroWaste, the first industrial-grade waste detection and segmentation dataset that includes real-life scenarios. We believe that ZeroWaste will stimulate research in object detection and semantic segmentation in highly cluttered environments, as well as have applications in the recycling industry.
