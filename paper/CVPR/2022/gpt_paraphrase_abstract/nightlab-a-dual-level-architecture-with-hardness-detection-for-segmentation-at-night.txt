Nighttime semantic segmentation is a challenging task, crucial for applications such as self-driving cars. However, it has been less explored compared to daytime segmentation. This paper introduces NightLab, a new framework for nighttime segmentation. NightLab utilizes multiple deep learning models with night-aware features to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various night segmentation benchmarks. The framework consists of two levels: image and regional. Each level includes light adaptation and segmentation modules. The image level model initially estimates the segmentation, while a hardness detection module identifies regions that require further analysis. The regional level model focuses on these challenging regions to improve the segmentation significantly. All models in NightLab are trained end-to-end using proposed night-aware losses without manual heuristics. Extensive experiments on the NightCity and BDD100K datasets demonstrate NightLab's superiority over existing methods. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/xdeng7/NightLab.
