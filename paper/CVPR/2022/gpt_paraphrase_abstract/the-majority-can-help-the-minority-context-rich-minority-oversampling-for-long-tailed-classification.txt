The issue with imbalanced data is that the classifier's ability to make accurate predictions decreases due to a lack of data from minority classes. This paper introduces a new approach to address this problem by using a minority oversampling technique that incorporates diverse minority samples by utilizing the contextual information present in majority class images. The main idea is to paste a minority class image onto a majority class image as a background, thereby diversifying the minority samples. This method is straightforward and can be easily integrated with existing long-tailed recognition methods. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our oversampling technique. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various long-tailed classification benchmarks, without requiring any architectural modifications or complex algorithms.
