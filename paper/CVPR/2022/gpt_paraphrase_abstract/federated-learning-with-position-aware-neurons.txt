Federated Learning (FL) is a method that combines collaborative models from local nodes without centralizing users' data. However, the inherent permutation invariance property of neural networks and the non-i.i.d. nature of data across clients result in imprecise alignment of locally updated parameters, making coordinate-based parameter averaging difficult. This is because traditional neurons do not explicitly consider position information. To address this issue, we propose the use of Position-Aware Neurons (PANs), which incorporate position-related values (position encodings) into neuron outputs.PANs are designed to couple themselves to their positions, minimizing the likelihood of dislocation even when updating on heterogeneous data. By enabling or disabling PANs, we can control the permutation invariance property of neural networks. When applied to FL, PANs establish a strong connection with positions, ensuring that parameters across clients are pre-aligned and facilitating coordinate-based parameter averaging. The use of PANs is not limited to a specific algorithm and can improve existing FL algorithms universally.Additionally, implementing "FL with PANs" is straightforward and computationally efficient.
