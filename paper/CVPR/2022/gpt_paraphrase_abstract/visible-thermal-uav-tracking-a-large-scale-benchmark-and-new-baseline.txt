This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called VTUAV for visible-thermal UAV tracking. The dataset consists of 500 sequences with 1.7 million high-resolution frame pairs, providing a diverse range of categories and scenes for evaluation. In addition, the dataset includes coarse-to-fine attribute annotations to enhance the performance of challenge-specific trackers. The paper also presents a new RGB-T baseline tracker called HMFT, which utilizes hierarchical multi-modal fusion to combine RGB-T data at different levels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HMFT and the complementary nature of different fusion types. The VTUAV dataset and HMFT tracker are made available for further research.
