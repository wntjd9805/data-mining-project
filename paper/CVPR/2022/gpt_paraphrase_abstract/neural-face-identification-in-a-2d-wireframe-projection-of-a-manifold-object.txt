This article proposes a novel approach to the problem of reconstructing 3D models from 2D line drawings in computer-aided design (CAD) systems. The key challenge lies in identifying the edge loops in the line drawing that correspond to the actual faces of the 3D object. Rather than relying on hand-crafted rules and heuristics, the authors present a data-driven solution that frames face identification as a sequence generation problem. They utilize a modified Transformer model to predict the edges associated with the same face in a natural order, thereby avoiding exhaustive search and addressing complex cases like curved surfaces and nested edge loops. The authors also explore how imperfect predictions can still contribute to 3D object reconstruction. The project webpage can be found at https://manycore-research.github.io/faceformer.
