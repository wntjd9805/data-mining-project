Understanding network generalization and feature discrimination is a current challenge in visual recognition research. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality of feature representations. A common approach is to use a linear probing classifier to measure class accuracy based on the obtained features. However, the effectiveness of this linear probe in assessing features' suitability for linear classification during training is often overlooked. To address this, we propose an episodic linear probing (ELP) classifier that reflects the generalization of visual representations in an online manner. ELP is trained using detached features from the network and is periodically re-initialized. This approach demonstrates the discriminability of visual representations during training. Furthermore, we introduce an ELP-suitable Regularization term (ELP-SR) to measure the distances between probability distributions of the ELP classifier and the main classifier. ELP-SR incorporates a re-scaling factor to adaptively regulate each sample during training, encouraging discriminative and generalized features. We conducted experiments on three real-world visual recognition tasks: fine-grained visual classification, long-tailed visual recognition, and generic object recognition. The results show significant improvements in performance, indicating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing network generalization and feature discrimination.
